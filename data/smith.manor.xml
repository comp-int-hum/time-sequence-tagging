          <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Barbara</persName> the eldeſt, and <persName>Mrs.

            <p>About four miles from the ancient and

          <lb/>perſon who could claim any affinity with
          <lb/>the <name>Rayland</name> family: this was a gentle­
          <lb/>man of the name of <persName>Somerive</persName>; who was
          <lb/>conſidered by the people of the country
          <lb/>as heir at law, as he was the grandſon of
          <lb/>one of the ſiſters of <persName>Sir Hildebrand</persName>: but

          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> herſelf, whoſe opinion was
          <lb/>more material, ſince it was all at her own
          <lb/>diſpoſal, did not by any means ſeem to
          <lb/>entertain the ſame idea.</p>
            <p>The venerable lady, and her two ſiſters,
          <lb/>had never beheld this their relation with
          <lb/>the eyes of friendly intereſt; nor had they
          <lb/>ever extended towards him that generous
          <lb/>favour which they had ſo much the power to
          <lb/>afford, and which could not have failed to
          <lb/>prove very acceptable; ſince he had mar­
          <lb/>ried early in life, and had a family of two
          <lb/>ſons and four daughters to ſupport on the
          <lb/>produce of an eſtate, which, though he
          <lb/>farmed it himſelf, did not bring in a clear
          <lb/>five hundred pounds a year.</p>
            <p>Various reaſons, or rather prejudices, had
          <lb/>concurred to occaſion this coolneſs on the
          <lb/>part of the ladies towards their couſin.—
          <lb/>Their aunt, who had married his anceſtor,
          <lb/>had, as they had always been taught, de­
          <lb/>graded herſelf extremely, by giving herſelf
          <lb/>to a man who was a mere yeoman.—The

          <lb/>the illuſtrious heireſſes of the houſe of
          <lb/><name>Rayland</name>; but following moſt plebeian-
          <lb/>like the unaſpiring inclination of his own
          <lb/>family, he had fallen in love with a young
          <lb/>woman, who lived with them as com­
          <lb/>panion; when it was believed that, as he
          <lb/>was a remarkably handſome man, he might
          <lb/>have lifted his eyes with impunity to one of
          <lb/>the ladies, his couſins: this occaſioned an
          <lb/>eſtrangement of many years, and had
          <lb/>never been forgiven.—The recollection of
          <lb/>it returned with acrimonious violence, when
          <lb/>the ſon of this imprudent man imitated
          <lb/>his father, five-and-twenty afterwards, and
          <lb/>married a woman, who had nothing to re­
          <lb/>commend her but beauty, ſimplicity, and
          <lb/>goodneſs.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding the repeated
          <lb/>cauſes of complaint which this luckleſs
          <lb/>family of <name>Somerive</name> had given to the

          <lb/>her grandfather; and ſhe therefore recom­

          <lb/>was named, by reluctantly obtained per­

          <lb/>ſideration of her ſiſters, and even gave to
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> himſelf a legacy of five hun­
          <lb/>dred pounds; a gift which her ſiſters took
          <lb/>ſo much amiſs (though they poſſeſſed be­
          <lb/>tween them a yearly income of near twice
          <lb/>five thouſand), that it had nearly rendered
          <lb/>her injunction abortive; and they treated
          <lb/>the whole family for ſome time afterwards
          <lb/>with the greateſt coolneſs, and even rude­
          <lb/>neſs; as if to convince them, that though
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had thus acknowledged their

          <lb/>his introduction was principally owing to

          <lb/>had acted extremely wrong; but it was from
          <lb/>motives ſo natural, that his error was rather
          <lb/>lamented than blamed.—An error however,
          <lb/>and of the moſt dangerous tendency, he

          <lb/>where ſhe had married the chaplain, and

          <lb/>never appeared before the lady but by

          <lb/>her little fair countenance had at times
          <lb/>ſomething of a melancholy caſt, there was
          <lb/>more of ſweetneſs than of ſorrow in it; and

          <lb/>the painter of the Seaſons for the repreſent­

          <lb/>was not likely to recommend her to the

          <lb/>as to recommend her was the deſign of

          <lb/>four or five years old would be much leſs
          <lb/>obnoxious than one of fifteen, or even nine
          <lb/>or ten; and therefore ſhe contrived to in­

            <p>She contrived that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> might
          <lb/>firſt ſee the little orphan as by chance;
          <lb/>then ſhe ſent her in, when ſhe knew her

          <lb/>of fruit; an early pine; ſome preſerves in
          <lb/>brandy, or ſomething or other which was
          <lb/>acceptable to the lady's palate; and on
          <lb/>theſe occaſions <persName>Monimia</persName> acquitted herſelf
          <lb/>to a miracle; and preſented her little offer­

          <lb/>much innocent grace, that <persName>Hecate</persName> in the
          <lb/>midſt of her rites might have ſuſpended
          <lb/>her incantations to have admired her. At

          <lb/>came a frequent gueſt in the parlour, and

          <lb/>took ſuch pains to lead her imagination

          <lb/>by <persName>Queen Anne</persName> to the laſt <persName>Lady Rayland</persName>
          <lb/>on her having no ſon, that a ſudden and
          <lb/>violent bounce towards the middle of the
          <lb/>gallery occaſioned an interruption of the
          <lb/>ſtory, and equal amazement in the lady and
          <lb/>her confidante; who both turning round,
          <lb/>not very nimbly indeed, demanded of <persName>Moni­
            <lb/>mia</persName>, who had been ſitting in one of the old-
          <lb/>faſhioned bow-windows of which the caſe­

            <p><persName>Monimia</persName>, covered with bluſhes, and in a

            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, who probably gueſſed the

          <lb/>if poſſible, who had from the court below
          <lb/>thrown in the ſomething that had thus

            <lb/>I muſt have been miſtaken, for certainly

            <lb/>the ſpirits of wicked perſons are ſaid to

            <p>It was now the turn of poor <persName>Monimia</persName> to

          <lb/>half frantic on her knees before him, and

          <lb/>There was ſomething more than gravity,

          <lb/>the fairy dreams which he indulged, reaſon
          <lb/>too often ſtepped in to poiſon his enjoy­

          <lb/>without fortune and without poſſeſſion—

          <lb/>had to procure one for himſelf. It was now
          <lb/>he firſt felt an earneſt wiſh, that the hopes
          <lb/>his relations had ſometimes encouraged
          <lb/>might be realized, and that ſome part of
          <lb/>the great wealth of the <name>Rayland</name> family
          <lb/>might be his: but with this he had no new

            <p>This neceſſity however lay heavy on the
          <lb/>heart of his father, who had long felt with
          <lb/>anguiſh, that the miſconduct of his eldeſt ſon
          <lb/>had rendered it impoſſible for him to do juſ­
          <lb/>tice to his younger. With a ſmall income
          <lb/>and a large family, he had never, though he
          <lb/>lived as economically as poſſible, been
          <lb/>able to lay by much money; and what he
          <lb/>had ſaved, in the hope of accumulating
          <lb/>ſmall fortunes for his daughters, had been
          <lb/>paid away for his eldeſt ſon in the firſt two
          <lb/>years of his reſidence at <orgName>Oxford</orgName>; the third
          <lb/>had nearly devoured the five hundred
          <lb/>pounds legacy given to the family by the
          <lb/>elder <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; and the firſt half-
          <lb/>year after he left the univerſity, and which
          <lb/>he paſſed between <placeName>London</placeName> and his father's
          <lb/>houſe, entirely exhauſted that reſource;

            <p>So deep, and often ſo fatal, are early im­

          <lb/>he ſhould not poſſeſs the greater part of the

          <lb/>arguments of <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> himſelf, or the
          <lb/>tears and tender remonſtrances of his wife,
          <lb/>were employed, whenever their ſon would
          <lb/>give them an opportunity, to counteract this
          <lb/>unfortunate prepoſſeſſion. He by degrees
          <lb/>began to abſent himſelf more and more
          <lb/>from home; and when he was there, his
          <lb/>hours were ſuch as put any converſation on
          <lb/>ſerious topics out of their power. He was
          <lb/>never indeed ſullen, for that was not his

          <lb/>means of ſending him to the univerſity, of

          <lb/>hope that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> might, if he were
          <lb/>qualified for orders, give him one of the

          <lb/>money enough to purchaſe him a commiſ­
          <lb/>ſion, which he once intended. Sometimes
          <lb/>he fancied that, if he were to apply to <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Rayland</persName>, ſhe would aſſiſt in ſecuring an
          <lb/>eſtabliſhment in future for one about whom
          <lb/>ſhe appeared ſo much intereſted at preſent;
          <lb/>but he oftener apprehended, from the od­

            <p><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, though a woman of an

          <lb/>indeed well juſtified by the good qualities
          <lb/>and handſome perſon of her ſon, conti­
          <lb/>nually ſuggeſted to her that <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName>
          <lb/>prepoſſeſſion in his favour, if left to take its
          <lb/>courſe, would finally make him the heir of
          <lb/>at leaſt great part of her property.</p>
            <p>Thus his father, from uncertainty how
          <lb/>to act for the beſt, ſuffered weeks and
          <lb/>months to paſs away, in which he could not
          <lb/>determine to act at all; and as more than
          <lb/>half thoſe weeks and months were paſſed at
          <lb/>the Hall, his mother fondly flattered her­
          <lb/>ſelf, that he was making rapid advances in
          <lb/>ſecuring to his family the poſſeſſions they
          <lb/>had ſo good a claim to.</p>
            <p>Neither of them ſaw the danger to which

          <lb/>young woman, while they ſuppoſed him
          <lb/>wholly given up to acquire the favour of
          <lb/>an old one; for in fact <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had
          <lb/>ſo artfully kept her niece out of ſight, that

          <lb/>knew that there was a young perſon in the
          <lb/>houſe who was conſidered in the light of a
          <lb/>ſervant; but whether ſhe was well or ill
          <lb/>looking, it had never occurred to them to
          <lb/>enquire, becauſe they never ſuppoſed her
          <lb/>more acquainted with their ſon than any
          <lb/>other of the female domeſtics.</p>
            <p>Poor <persName>Orlando</persName>, however, was cheriſhing a
          <lb/>paſſion, which had taken entire poſſeſſion of
          <lb/>his heart before he was conſcious that he had
          <lb/>one, and which the reſtraints that every
          <lb/>way ſurrounded him ſerved only to inflame.
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> now appeared in his eyes, what
          <lb/>ſhe really was, infinitely more lovely than
          <lb/>ever. She was on his account a priſoner,
          <lb/>for he learned that when he was not in the
          <lb/>country ſhe was allowed more liberty. She
          <lb/>was friendleſs, and harſhly treated; and,
          <lb/>with a form and face that he thought would
          <lb/>do honour to the higheſt rank of ſociety,
          <lb/>ſhe ſeemed to be condemned to perpetual
          <lb/>ſervitude, and he feared to perpetual igno­

          <lb/>but the plaineſt domeſtic duties, and the
          <lb/>plaineſt work. She had however taught
          <lb/>herſelf, with very little aid from her aunt,
          <lb/>to read; and lately, ſince ſhe had been ſo
          <lb/>much alone, ſhe had tried to write; but ſhe
          <lb/>had not always materials, and was frequent­
          <lb/>ly compelled to hide thoſe ſhe contrived
          <lb/>to obtain: ſo that her progreſs in this was
          <lb/>ſlow, and made only by ſnatches, as the ill
          <lb/>humour of her aunt allowed or forbade her
          <lb/>to make theſe laudable attempts at im­
          <lb/>provement.</p>
            <p>Her apartment was ſtill in the turret that
          <lb/>terminated one wing of the houſe, and <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName> had been at the Hall the greater part
          <lb/>of a fortnight, without their having ex­
          <lb/>changed a ſingle word. They had indeed
          <lb/>met only twice by mere accident, in the
          <lb/>preſence of the lady of the manſion and
          <lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>; once when ſhe croſſed

          <lb/>managed better than any body.</p>
            <p>As ſhe knelt to perform this operation,
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, who was reading a practical diſ­
          <lb/>courſe on faith in oppoſition to good works,
          <lb/>was ſurpriſed by her beautiful figure in her
          <lb/>ſimple ſtuff gown, which had ſuch an effect
          <lb/>on his imagination that he no longer knew
          <lb/>what he was reading: but, after half a

          <lb/>affecting to be ſeized with a violent cough,
          <lb/>got up and went out. Again, however, this

            <p>The window was equally well ſecured,

            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had given him, under re­

          <lb/>up, though the deſcendants no longer
          <lb/>emulated the honours of their progenitors

          <lb/>it among other accompliſhments that of

          <lb/>ſtood in the park. To this place, there­
          <lb/>fore, he repaired; and in removing the

          <lb/>by time, ſome other ſlabs of wood, boards,
          <lb/>and pieces of ſcaffolding were moved alſo,

          <lb/>door, formerly boarded up, but of which
          <lb/>the boards were now broken and decayed:
          <lb/>he forced away a piece of the rotten wood,

          <lb/>round the room occupied by <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/>which it was probable had a communica­

          <lb/>he diſtinctly heard <persName>Monimia</persName> ſigh deeply,
          <lb/>and open a drawer. He conſidered a mo­

          <lb/>leaſt likely to alarm her too ſuddenly, and
          <lb/>at length he determined to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>After another pauſe, and finding all was

          <lb/>was equal to that of its neareſt neighbour,
          <lb/>a nobleman, who owned a great extent of
          <lb/>country which immediately adjoined to the

          <lb/>and magnificent dulneſs that their fathers

          <lb/>might gain any footing in the neighbour­

            <p>But the winter preceding the period of

          <lb/>at the age of ninety-ſix, to the regret of

          <lb/>His eſtate fell to the grandſon of his only
          <lb/>ſiſter, a man of three-and-twenty, who was as
          <lb/>completely the nobleman of the preſent day,
          <lb/>as his uncle had been the repreſentative
          <lb/>of thoſe who lived in the reign of <persName>George

          <lb/>of his uncle's caſtle, to have been maſter
          <lb/>of ſix times its revenue. His paternal pro­
          <lb/>perty and parliamentary intereſt lay in a

          <lb/>money was a greater object to him than

            <p>The purchaſe of <name>Carloraine Caſtle</name> by

          <lb/>to them all—ſo that what was built up to-
          <lb/>day, was pulled down to-morrow. All the

            <lb/>keys, has my lady's leave to have keys of

            <lb/>pleaſure in uſing when he is out (which he

            <lb/>ſhe really wants the things ſhe ſends for or

            <lb/>and when I came back to ſay there was

            <lb/>a dozen bottles; and ſhe gave me the key
            <lb/>and a baſket. I ſtood trembling with fear;

          <lb/>that her infant underſtanding had received,
          <lb/>tended only to confirm the artificial influ­
          <lb/>ence which her aunt endeavoured to eſta­

            <p>But ſhe had learned now that, abject

          <lb/>great teacher of that religion which ſhe had
          <lb/>been bid to profeſs, though very little in­
          <lb/>ſtructed in it, was himſelf poor, and the
          <lb/>advocate and friend of poverty. In addi­

          <lb/>quired, ſhe had lately made another diſco­
          <lb/>very. Her aunt had always told her that
          <lb/>ſhe was a very plain girl, had a bad perſon,
          <lb/>and was barely fit to be ſeen; but ſince the
          <lb/>marriage of the ſervant who had lived at
          <lb/>the Hall during the infancy of <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/><persName>Betty Richards</persName>, the under houſe-maid, had
          <lb/>been ordered to do the little that <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>was allowed to have done in her room.
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had taken her from the

          <lb/>not the leaſt idea that under that ſemblance
          <lb/>ſhe concealed the cunning and the vanity
          <lb/>of a country coquet; and that the firſt

          <lb/>was a ruddy, ſhewy girl, with a large but

          <lb/>ſooner waſhed, and her hair combed over
          <lb/>a  roll, than ſhe became an object which
          <lb/>attracted the attention of the great <persName>Mr.
          <lb/>Pattenſon</persName> himſelf; who, proceeding in the
          <lb/>uſual way by which he had won the favour
          <lb/>of ſo many of the ſubaltern nymphs in <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Rayland's</persName> kitchen, began to make her ma­
          <lb/>ny preſents, and to talk of her beauty; and
          <lb/>as ſhe could not forbear repeating all theſe
          <lb/>extravagant expreſſions of his admiration,
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> could as little help reflecting,
          <lb/>though ſhe was ſomehow humbled as ſhe

          <lb/>handſome, ſhe could not herſelf be ſo ugly

          <lb/>conſiſted only of beads and ribbands was re­
          <lb/>ſerved for Sunday afternoons, and put on at
          <lb/>a friend's cottage near a diſtant church. But
          <lb/>it was not in female nature to conceal theſe
          <lb/>acquiſitions from <persName>Monimia</persName>; and it was in
          <lb/>her drawers that they were often depoſited,
          <lb/>when there was reaſon to apprehend that
          <lb/>the little deal box, which had till lately
          <lb/>been amply ſufficient for the check apron

          <lb/>envy, and that to remonſtrate would proba­
          <lb/>bly be vain. She contented herſelf there­
          <lb/>fore with keeping as much out of her confi­

          <lb/>of her own, which were continually ſtrength­

          <lb/>few exhibited a greater variety of intereſts
          <lb/>than did the family of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>. <persName>Mrs.

            <p>The old coachman, who was the other
          <lb/>favourite ſervant, was always a third in
          <lb/>theſe peace-making meetings. He was a
          <lb/>man grown unwieldy from exceſs of good
          <lb/>living, and more than ſeventy years old;
          <lb/>but he poſſeſſed an infinite deal of cunning,
          <lb/>and knew how to get and how to keep mo­
          <lb/>ney, with which it was his ambition to por­
          <lb/>tion his two daughters, and to marry them
          <lb/>to gentlemen; and his dealings in contra­
          <lb/>band goods, as <name>Rayland Hall</name> was only five
          <lb/>miles from the coaſt, his having the manage­
          <lb/>ment of the great farms in hand, and his

          <lb/>together ſuppoſed to have rendered this
          <lb/>object of ambition of eaſy attainment. Of
          <lb/>deeper ſagacity than the other two, he fore­
          <lb/>ſaw that the time could not be far diſtant
          <lb/>when <name>Rayland Hall</name>, and all the wealth that

          <lb/>now, and to be well aſſured of a very con­
          <lb/>ſiderable legacy hereafter. But old <persName>Snel­
          <lb/>craft</persName> had farther hopes; and for that reaſon,
          <lb/>though he had at firſt oppoſed as much as
          <lb/>he could the reception of <persName>Orlando</persName>, and
          <lb/>ſince expreſſed diſpleaſure towards him, he

          <lb/>to the eſtate, he might marry his favourite
          <lb/>daughter, <persName>Miſs Patty Snelcraft</persName>, who would
          <lb/>have ſuch a fine fortune, and was, as her fa­
          <lb/>ther believed, the very extract of all beauty.
          <lb/>Ridiculous and chimerical as ſuch a project
          <lb/>was, the old man, in the dotage of his purſe-
          <lb/>proud vanity, believed it not only poſſible
          <lb/>but probable: for, though he knew that
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> would have diſinherited her
          <lb/>own ſon for entertaining ſuch an idea for a
          <lb/>moment, yet he ſaw that <persName>Mr. Orlando</persName> had
          <lb/>no pride at all; and he was pretty ſure, from
          <lb/>the arrangements that he believed were
          <lb/>made as to money, that, great as the ſum of
          <lb/>ready money would perhaps be that <persName>Mrs.

          <lb/>that her aunt determined ſhe <emph>ſhould</emph> ſtay,
          <lb/>ſhe hung her foot as if by accident in the
          <lb/>long roll of linen that was on the ground,
          <lb/>and, in pretending to diſengage it, fell with
          <lb/>ſome violence againſt an old heavy gilt lea­

            <p>Her aunt, however, did not perceive it,
          <lb/>till the blood ſtreamed from her arm, round

          <lb/>where, under pretence that the accident
          <lb/>of having hurt her arm had turned her
          <lb/>ſick, ſhe begged a glaſs of water, and lay

            <p>This letter was received at Wolverton
          <lb/>while <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, his two ſons, <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Woodford</persName> and <persName>Mr. Fitz-Owen</persName> were yet
          <lb/>over their wine. The anxious father open­
          <lb/>ed it with a palpitating heart, nor were the
          <lb/>younger part of the audience leſs ſolicitious
          <lb/>to know its contents. As there were none
          <lb/>of them towards whom ſecrecy was abſolute­
          <lb/>ly neceſſary, though it might have been
          <lb/>more prudent, <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, at the requeſt
          <lb/>of his eldeſt ſon, put it acroſs the table to

          <lb/>him—who, with that thoughtleſs indiſcre­
          <lb/>tion which marked his character, read it
          <lb/>aloud, with comments ſerving to turn into
          <lb/>ridicule the writer, and the ſentiments it
          <lb/>contained. The deſcription of <persName>Orlando</persName>—
          <lb/>under that of a ſober, promiſing, and well-
          <lb/>conditioned youth—was read with a burſt of
          <lb/>laughter; while the ſlighting way in which
          <lb/>trade was mentioned, and the contempt
          <lb/>thrown on ſhopkeepers, under which <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Rayland</persName> ſeemed to deſcribe wine-merchants
          <lb/>and every perſon in buſineſs, raiſed the in­
          <lb/>dignation of Mr. Woodford and Mr. Fitz-
          <lb/>Owen, who both agreed in declaring that the
          <lb/>opinion of ſuch an old crone was not worth
          <lb/>conſulting; that ſhe was in a perfect dotage,
          <lb/>as well from pride as old age; and that it was
          <lb/>a condeſcenſion in <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> to have
          <lb/>conſulted her at all. <persName>Orlando</persName>, however, ſaw
          <lb/>all this with concern mingled with joy. He
          <lb/>was pretty ſure, from the countenance of
          <lb/>his father, which he ſolicitouſly watched as
          <lb/>he perſued the letter, that the part of it
          <lb/>which related to himſelf was kinder than he

          <lb/>expected; that it had turned the fluctuating
          <lb/>and undecided opinion of his father in his
          <lb/>favour; and that he ſhould not now, by
          <lb/>being ſent with his uncle Woodford, be
          <lb/>condemned to the double miſery of quitting
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, and aſſociating with perſons
          <lb/>whoſe manners and ideas were ſo different
          <lb/>from his own, that it was a perpetual puniſh­
          <lb/>ment to him to be in their company. The
          <lb/>diſpleaſure of his brother at the partiality
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> expreſſed for him was eaſily
          <lb/>accounted for; and <persName>Orlando</persName> had long accuſ­
          <lb/>tomed himſelf to bear his rough jokes, and
          <lb/>even his ſarcaſtic reproaches, which he vent­
          <lb/>ed whenever they met, without much un­
          <lb/>eaſineſs.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> could diſen­
          <lb/>gage himſelf from his company, he with­
          <lb/>drew to conſult with his wife on the purport
          <lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> letter, and made a ſign
          <lb/>to <persName>Orlando</persName> to follow him in a few moments.
          <lb/>—He did ſo, and found his father and mo­
          <lb/>ther in conſultation in the garden. The
          <lb/>mother, whoſe heart was half broken at the

          <lb/>idea of parting with her daughter ſo ſud­
          <lb/>denly, was weeping with joy to find that
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> would not yet leave her: flattering
          <lb/>herſelf, from the purport of the letter, that
          <lb/>the affluent fortune of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> would
          <lb/>at laſt centre with <persName>Orlando</persName>, and putting
          <lb/>the moſt favourable conſtruction on every
          <lb/>expreſſion that related to him, ſhe agreed
          <lb/>with <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, that nothing would be
          <lb/>ſo imprudent as to think of removing him;
          <lb/>and it was even determined, that Mr. Some­
          <lb/>rive ſhould that evening write to her
          <lb/>again, thanking her for her advice about
          <lb/>his daughter, and leaving the future fate of
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> wholly to her diſpoſal; that <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName> ſhould himſelf carry the letter, and
          <lb/>aſk leave to take his former apartments for
          <lb/>ſome time—only returning once again to
          <lb/>Wolverton to take leave of his eldeſt ſiſter,
          <lb/>whom he was to ſee no more before ſhe
          <lb/>went to Ireland—and of his ſecond ſiſter
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName>, who was to accompany her to Lon­
          <lb/>don, and to paſs ſome time with her uncle
          <lb/>and aunt Woodford.</p>

            <p>Never did <persName>Orlando</persName> obey his father with
          <lb/>more alacrity than on this occaſion; and on
          <lb/>his return <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> never received
          <lb/>him more kindly. He was now again in­
          <lb/>vited to partake of her ſupper: without
          <lb/>putting much force on himſelf, he ſhewed
          <lb/>her exactly that ſort of attention which was
          <lb/>the moſt agreeable to her, and appeared
          <lb/>grateful without being ſervile. At length
          <lb/>he was diſmiſſed; and, when the houſe was
          <lb/>perfectly quiet, he flew to <persName>Monimia</persName>, who
          <lb/>accompanied him to the ſtudy; and when
          <lb/>he related how much more happily the
          <lb/>events of the day had paſſed than he had
          <lb/>at its beginning expected, ſhe ſhed tears of
          <lb/>delight; and the ſweet ſenſations of hope,
          <lb/>which they now dared to indulge more than
          <lb/>there ever yet appeared reaſon to indulge
          <lb/>them, made this one of the happieſt even­
          <lb/>ings they had ever paſſed together.</p>
            <p>The following day <persName>Orlando</persName> returned to
          <lb/>the houſe of his father, and found that, in
          <lb/>regard to ſome parts of his family, a new

          <lb/>rive, as the hour approached for her two
          <lb/>eldeſt daughters to leave her—one to be
          <lb/>ſeparated from her perhaps for years, and
          <lb/>to enter into another family—found herſelf
          <lb/>ſo much affected, that her huſband, who
          <lb/>was very indulgent to her, agreed ſhe
          <lb/>ſhould accompany the party to <placeName>London</placeName>,
          <lb/>be preſent at the wedding of her daughter,
          <lb/>and return in a fortnight, bringing <persName>Iſabella</persName>
          <lb/>back with her, if the idea of leaving her was
          <lb/>at the end of that time uneaſy to her. This
          <lb/>being ſettled, <persName>Orlando</persName> took leave of his
          <lb/>mother and ſiſters that evening: the for­
          <lb/>mer rejoicing that he would remain in the
          <lb/>country; and the latter, but particularly
          <lb/>the eldeſt, lamenting their ſeparation with
          <lb/>many tears: for <persName>Orlando</persName>, who was ten­
          <lb/>derly attentive to his ſiſters, was fondly be­
          <lb/>loved by them all; though to Selina, the
          <lb/>third, who was a year younger than him­
          <lb/>ſelf, he was more attached than to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Penſively he returned back to the Hall
          <lb/>after this melancholy parting: it was the
          <lb/>firſt time the family had been thus ſeparat­

          <lb/>of his eldeſt ſon, the union of Mr. Some­
          <lb/>rive's children, and the promiſe they all
          <lb/>gave of excellence, had hitherto made him
          <lb/>amends for much of the difficulty he found
          <lb/>in ſupporting them. But <persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw that
          <lb/>the hour was now come when his father
          <lb/>felt equal pain for the fate of thoſe who
          <lb/>were about to be what is called eſtabliſhed
          <lb/>in the world, and for thoſe whom he knew
          <lb/>not how to eſtabliſh, or, in caſe of his death,
          <lb/>to provide for. All that filial tenderneſs
          <lb/>and good ſenſe could ſuggeſt to his ingenu­
          <lb/>ous and generous mind, he ſaid to conſole
          <lb/>his father; but with infinite concern he ob­
          <lb/>ſerved, that the wounds inflicted by the
          <lb/>profligacy of his brother feſtered more
          <lb/>deeply every day, and that all he could do
          <lb/>had too little power to aſſuage the conſtant
          <lb/>pain ariſing from this ſource; from which,
          <lb/>though his father did not complain, Orlan­
          <lb/>do thought it but too evident that his health
          <lb/>was gradually impaired.</p>

          <lb/>gave him he found the only reſpite in his
          <lb/>books, to which he aſſiduouſly applied him­
          <lb/>ſelf—and in his evening conferences with
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, who every hour became more
          <lb/>dear to him, and whoſe perſonal charms
          <lb/>ſeemed every hour heightened by the pro­
          <lb/>greſs of her underſtanding. As the nights
          <lb/>became longer, and more obſcure, they met
          <lb/>earlier, and with leſs apprehenſion of detec­
          <lb/>tion; and as <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> ſeemed to be­
          <lb/>come more and more remiſs in her office
          <lb/>of duenna, the opportunities they had of

          <lb/>between their meetings.</p>
            <p>Thus almoſt a fortnight paſſed after the

          <lb/>morning to enquire after him, Mrs. Ray­
          <lb/>land ſeeming every day more fond of his

          <lb/>him as the future maſter of the domain,
          <lb/>where he was now inveſted with powers he
          <lb/>had never before enjoyed. The game-
          <lb/>keeper was ordered to ſuffer no other per­
          <lb/>ſon to have the liberty of ſhooting on the

          <lb/>think it equally unworthy to uſe a little art
          <lb/>to promote the intereſt of his love. Mrs.
          <lb/>Lennard was remarkably open to two ſorts
          <lb/>of adulation—She loved to be thought a
          <lb/>woman of ſenſe, and to hear how fine her
          <lb/>perſon muſt have been in her younger days.
          <lb/>She was even now accuſtomed to ſay, that
          <lb/>though not ſo well to <emph>meet</emph>, ſhe was ſtill well
          <lb/>to <emph>follow</emph>; for ſhe fancied her tall perpendi­
          <lb/>cular figure exhibited ſtill a great deal of
          <lb/>dignity and grace. Theſe foibles were ſo
          <lb/>evident, and whenever ſhe was not with
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> ſhe took ſo little pains to
          <lb/>conceal them, that <persName>Orlando</persName>, who thought
          <lb/>it too probable that on her the future hap­
          <lb/>pineſs of his life depended, believed it not
          <lb/>wrong to take advantage of them to acquire
          <lb/>her favour; and he ſucceeded ſo well by
          <lb/>adroitly adminiſtering now and then a little
          <lb/>well-timed flattery, that <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> not
          <lb/>only held him in high eſteem, but endea­
          <lb/>voured to ſecure his, by cultivating the graces
          <lb/>he had remarked. She entered on a new

          <lb/>her appearance. To have made too many
          <lb/>and too rapid improvements in the latter

          <lb/>The place ſhe was to go to was rather a
          <lb/>large village than a town, and was about
          <lb/>three miles and a half from the Hall; the
          <lb/>way to it leading partly through the

          <lb/>woods and coppices which belonged to

          <lb/>that the old butler ſuſpected his ſtolen in­
          <lb/>terviews with <persName>Monimia</persName>.</p>
            <p>Uneaſy, however, at her ſtaying ſo much
          <lb/>later than the hour when he knew ſhe was
          <lb/>ordered to return, he could not forbear
          <lb/>making a circuit round the wood-walks of
          <lb/>the park, where he could not be obſerved,
          <lb/>and paſſing towards the preſerved pheaſant-
          <lb/>grounds, through which her path lay;
          <lb/>where he had not waited long before the
          <lb/>appearance of <persName>Monimia</persName>, attended by <persName>Sir
            <lb/>John Belgrave</persName>, produced the alarming con­
          <lb/>verſation which the laſt chapter related.</p>
            <p>When <persName>Orlando</persName> parted from <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/>and began coolly to conſider what had hap­
          <lb/>pened, he felt no other uneaſineſs than that
          <lb/>which aroſe from his apprehenſion that her
          <lb/>name might be brought in queſtion; for he

          <lb/>was a ſtranger to all perſonal fear, and was
          <lb/>totally indifferent to the reſentment of <persName>Sir
            <lb/>John Belgrave</persName>, which he thought it pro­
          <lb/>bable he might think it wiſe to lay aſide;
          <lb/>for he did not appear to be one of thoſe
          <lb/>who are eager to acquire fame by perſonal
          <lb/>danger. However that might be, <persName>Orlando's</persName>
          <lb/>principal concern was, how to appeaſe the
          <lb/>fears of <persName>Monimia</persName>; and as early as it was
          <lb/>ſafe to go to the turret, he repaired thither;
          <lb/>but this happened almoſt an hour later than
          <lb/>uſual. Pattenſon had viſitors, ſome tradeſ­
          <lb/>men from a neighbouring town, to ſup with
          <lb/>him; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, who was upon the
          <lb/>watch, had the mortification to hear them
          <lb/>ſinging in the butler's room at half after
          <lb/>eleven, and to find it near one o'clock
          <lb/>when they betook themſelves to their horſes,
          <lb/>and departed. It was yet near half an hour
          <lb/>longer before the lights about the houſe
          <lb/>were extinguiſhed, and all was quiet.</p>
            <p>The night, dark and tempeſtuous, added
          <lb/>to the gloomy appearance of all that ſur­
          <lb/>rounded <persName>Monimia</persName>; while her imagination,

          <lb/>filled with images of horror, repreſented to
          <lb/>her, that his delay was owing to the con­
          <lb/>ſequences of his morning's adventure: and
          <lb/>theſe apprehenſions, added to the fatigue
          <lb/>and anxiety ſhe had gone through during
          <lb/>the day, almoſt overcame her, before the
          <lb/>well known, long wiſhed for ſignal was
          <lb/>heard.</p>
            <p>At length <persName>Orlando</persName> had ſafely placed her
          <lb/>by the fire, and began to ſpeak as cheer­
          <lb/>fully as he could of what had paſſed; but
          <lb/>he ſaw her pale, dejected, and ready to
          <lb/>ſink—her eyes ſwollen with weeping—and
          <lb/>her whole frame languid, depreſſed by the
          <lb/>uneaſy circumſtances of the day, and the
          <lb/>uneaſy ſuſpenſe of the night. For the latter
          <lb/>he had eaſily accounted; and he endeavoured to
          <lb/>diſſipate her dread as to the conſequences
          <lb/>of the former. <said xml:id="Or137">This fine gentleman,</said> ſaid

            <lb/>either by himſelf, his friends or ſervants,
            <lb/>treſpaſſing on thoſe woods, where <persName>Mrs.
              <lb/>Rayland</persName> is ſo fond of preſerving the game,
            <lb/>nothing can be more ungentleman-like than
            <lb/>to perſiſt in it: it looks like taking advan­
            <lb/>tage of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> being without any
            <lb/>man about her who has a right to enforce
            <lb/>her wiſhes, which, whether capricious and
            <lb/>abſurd or no, ſhould ſurely be repſected.
            <lb/>I feel myſelf perfectly juſtified for having
            <lb/>ſpoken as I did, and only regret that you
            <lb/>were preſent. Relate to me, <persName>Monimia</persName>,
            <lb/>what paſſed before I met you. Did not

            <p><persName>Monimia</persName> then related all that had paſſed,
          <lb/>as well as the alarm ſhe had been in had al­

          <lb/>ſpeech he had made to <persName>Monimia</persName> as he
          <lb/>paſſed her, <persName>Orlando</persName> found more cauſe of
          <lb/>vexation than in any other circumſtance of
          <lb/>the morning. He foreſaw that the beauty
          <lb/>of <persName>Monimia</persName>, which had hitherto been quite
          <lb/>unobſerved, would now become the topic of
          <lb/>common converſation; his father and his
          <lb/>family would be alarmed, and his ſtay at
          <lb/>the Hall imputed to motives very different
          <lb/>from his love of ſolitude and ſtudy. Hither­
          <lb/>to <persName>Monimia</persName> had ſeemed a beautiful and
          <lb/>unique gem, of which none but himſelf
          <lb/>had diſcovered the concealment, or knew
          <lb/>the value. He had viſited it with fonder
          <lb/>idolatry, from alone poſſeſſing the know­
          <lb/>ledge where it was hid. But now half his
          <lb/>happineſs ſeemed to be deſtroyed, ſince his
          <lb/>treaſure was diſcovered, and particularly
          <lb/>by his brother, who was ſo looſe in his
          <lb/>principles, and ſo unfeeling in his conduct.
          <lb/>As theſe painful reflections paſſed through
          <lb/>his mind, he ſat a while ſilent and dejected,
          <lb/>till, being awakened from his mournful re­
          <lb/>verie by a deep ſigh from <persName>Monimia</persName>, he

          <lb/>ſaw her face bathed in tears. <said xml:id="Mon146">Ah! <persName>Or­

            <lb/>me, that the conſequence of this luckleſs
            <lb/>day will be our eternal ſeparation.</said> The
          <lb/>ſobs that ſwelled her boſom as ſhe ſaid this
          <lb/>impeded her utterance. <persName>Orlando</persName>, with more
          <lb/>than uſual tenderneſs, endeavoured to ſooth
          <lb/>and re-aſſure her—when ſuddenly, as he
          <lb/>hung fondly over he, ſpeaking to her in a
          <lb/>low voice, ſhe ſtarted, and ſaid, in a whiſper,

          <lb/>was ſomething more; and before he had
          <lb/>time to imagine what it might be, the old
          <lb/>heavy lock of the ſtudy door, that opened
          <lb/>from the paſſage to the chapel, was moved
          <lb/>ſlowly; the door as ſlowly opened, and at

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe fears were ever alive for
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, blew out the ſingle candle which
          <lb/>ſtood at ſome diſtance from them; and
          <lb/>then ſpringing towards the door he de­
          <lb/>manded fiercely who was there. <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/>whoſe terror almoſt annihilated her facul­
          <lb/>ties, would have thrown herſelf into his
          <lb/>arms, and there have waited the diſcovery
          <lb/>which appeared more dreadful than death:
          <lb/>but he was inſtantly gone, and purſued
          <lb/>through the chapel a man, whom however
          <lb/>he could not overtake, and who ſeemed at
          <lb/>the door to vaniſh—though the night was
          <lb/>ſo dark, that it was impoſſible to diſtinguiſh
          <lb/>any object whatever. Through the chapel
          <lb/>he had heard the ſound of feet; but when
          <lb/>he got to the porch, and from thence
          <lb/>liſtened for the ſame ſound to direct his
          <lb/>purſuit along the flag-ſtones, it was heard
          <lb/>no more. All was profoundly ſilent, unleſs
          <lb/>the ſtillneſs was interrupted by the howling
          <lb/>of the wind roudn the old buildings.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, after a moment's pauſe, was

          <lb/>he might encloſe an enemy within it, or
          <lb/>impede the eſcape of his <persName>Monimia</persName> to her
          <lb/>turret. Uncertain therefore what to do,
          <lb/>but too certain of the agonizing fears to
          <lb/>which he had left her expoſed, he haſtily
          <lb/>went back; and ſecuring that door which
          <lb/>led from the chapel to the paſſage as well
          <lb/>as he could (for there was no key to it, and
          <lb/>only a ſmall ruſty bar), and then faſtening
          <lb/>the door of the ſtudy, he approached, by
          <lb/>the light of the wood fire which was nearly
          <lb/>extinguiſhed, the fainting <persName>Monimia</persName>, who,
          <lb/>unable to ſupport herſelf, had ſunk on the
          <lb/>ground, and reſted her head on the old
          <lb/>tapeſtry chair on which ſhe had been ſit­
          <lb/>ting.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> found her cold, and almoſt in­
          <lb/>ſenſible; and it was ſome moments before
          <lb/>he could reſtore her to ſpeech. Terror
          <lb/>had deprived her of the power of ſhedding
          <lb/>tears; nor had ſhe ſtrength to ſit up: but
          <lb/>when he had placed her in her chair, he
          <lb/>was compelled to ſupport her, while he en­

          <lb/>deavoured to make light of a circumſtance
          <lb/>that overwhelmed him with alarm for her,
          <lb/>and with vexation beyond what he had ever
          <lb/>yet experienced.</p>
            <p>They had both diſtinctly beheld the
          <lb/>face, though neither had the leaſt idea to
          <lb/>whom it belonged. <persName>Orlando</persName> had as diſ­
          <lb/>tinctly heard the footſteps along the hollow
          <lb/>ground of the chapel; it was not therefore
          <lb/>one of thoſe ſupernatural beings, to whoſe
          <lb/>exiſtence <persName>Monimia</persName> had been taught to give
          <lb/>credit. <persName>Orlando</persName> would willingly have ſhel­
          <lb/>tered himſelf under ſuch a prejudice, had it
          <lb/>been poſſible; for all the ghoſts in the Red
          <lb/>Sea would have terrified him leſs than the
          <lb/>diſcovery of <persName>Monimia</persName> by any of the family:
          <lb/>yet, that ſuch a diſcovery was made, he
          <lb/>could not doubt; and the more he thought
          <lb/>of even its immediate conſequences, and
          <lb/>the impoſſiblity there might be to recon­
          <lb/>vey his lovely trembling charge to her own
          <lb/>room, the greater his diſtraction became;
          <lb/>while all he could make <persName>Monimia</persName> ſay,
          <lb/>was, <said xml:id="Mon150">Deareſt <persName>Orlando</persName>, let me ſtay and

            <lb/>certainly kill me: and if I die in your pre­

            <lb/>life <emph>has</emph> been, or than now it ever can
            <lb/>be.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> being thus under the neceſſity
          <lb/>of conquering his own extreme diſquiet, that
          <lb/>he might appeaſe hers, began to make va­
          <lb/>rious conjectures as to this man, tending to
          <lb/>encourage the hope that it was ſome acci­
          <lb/>dental intruder, and not one whoſe buſi­
          <lb/>neſs was to diſcover her. <said xml:id="Or140">But even if the
            <lb/>villain came with that deſign,</said> ſaid he, <said xml:id="Or141">I
            <lb/>do not believe he could diſtinguiſh you, ſo
            <lb/>inſtantly I blew out the candle: or, if he

          <lb/>tormented: but when <persName>Orlando</persName> ſeemed ſo
          <lb/>deeply affected by her ſituation; when he

          <lb/>diſcovery they dreaded, could make him ſo
          <lb/>wretched as ſeeing her in ſuch a ſituation;
          <lb/>ſhe made an effort to recover herſelf; and
          <lb/>at length ſucceeded ſo well as to regain the
          <lb/>power of conſulting with him, as to what
          <lb/>was beſt to be done.</p>
            <p>It was now early morning, but ſtill very
          <lb/>dark, with rain and wind. It was however
          <lb/>time to conſider of <persName>Monimia's</persName> return; for
          <lb/>within two hours the ſervants would be up,
          <lb/>and in even leſs time the labourers in the
          <lb/>gardens would come to their work. It was
          <lb/>at length agreed, taht <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhould go
          <lb/>through the chapel firſt, and try if he could
          <lb/>diſcover any traces of their alarming viſitor;
          <lb/>and if, after his reconnoitring, all ap­
          <lb/>peared ſafe, that <persName>Monimia</persName> ſhould return as

          <lb/>his candle behind the door on one of the
          <lb/>benches, but nobody appeared: and by the
          <lb/>very faint light of the firſt dawn, on a
          <lb/>ſtormy October morning, which ſerved only

          <lb/>her that the wretch, whoever he was, was
          <lb/>gone; and that there ſeemed to be no dan­

          <lb/>endeavoured again to perſuade her that her
          <lb/>alarm, however juſt, would end without
          <lb/>any of the conſequences they dreaded;
          <lb/>made her ſwallow a large glaſs of wine;
          <lb/>and then taking one of her hands in his,

          <lb/>hardly breathed; when arriving about the

          <lb/>by a ſudden and loud craſh, which ſeemed
          <lb/>to proceed from the chancel; and a deep
          <lb/>hollow voice pronounced the words, <said>Now
            <lb/>—now.</said></p>
            <p>There was a heavy ſtone font in the mid­
          <lb/>dle of the chapel, with a ſort of bench under
          <lb/>it. <persName>Orlando</persName>, unable at once to ſupport and
          <lb/>defend <persName>Monimia</persName>, placed her on this bench;
          <lb/>and imploring her to take courage, he dart­
          <lb/>ed forward into the chancel, from whence
          <lb/>he was ſure the voice had iſſued, and cried
          <lb/>aloud, <said xml:id="Or142">Who is there? Speak this mo­

            <p>The words re-echoed through the vaulted
          <lb/>chancel, but no anſwer was returned: again,
          <lb/>and in a yet louder voice, he repeated them,
          <lb/>and again liſtened to hear if any reply was
          <lb/>made. A ſlight and indiſtinct noiſe like the
          <lb/>ſhutting a diſtant door, and a low murmur
          <lb/>which ſoon died away, left every thing in
          <lb/>profound ſilence. He remained however

            <p>When <persName>Orlando</persName> returned to her, he found

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, having ſeen her ſecured in her

          <lb/>to diſcover, if poſſible, what it was that had

          <lb/>over every part, but could diſcover nothing.
          <lb/>He then determined to go round the houſe;
          <lb/>and reſolute not to ſpare any wretch who
          <lb/>might be lurking about it with evil de­

          <lb/>body of the houſe, where, over the chimney,
          <lb/>ſeveral ſorts of arms were diſpoſed, which
          <lb/>for many years had never been uſed. He
          <lb/>tood down an hanger, and a pair of horſe
          <lb/>piſtols: both were ſomewhat injured by neg­
          <lb/>lect, and of the latter he knew he could
          <lb/>make no uſe till they had been cleaned;
          <lb/>but drawing the hanger from its ſcabbard,
          <lb/>he ſallied forth in eager expectation of find­
          <lb/>ing ſome means to diſcover, and at leaſt to
          <lb/>terrify from future intruſion, the man he
          <lb/>had ſeen and heard: but after wandering
          <lb/>round the houſe, through the gardens, and
          <lb/>even over the adjoining offices, for above
          <lb/>an hour, he ſaw nothing that could lead
          <lb/>him to gueſs who it could be. The work­
          <lb/>men and ſervants were all at their uſual em­
          <lb/>ployments. He talked to ſome of them,
          <lb/>but obſerved no conſciouſneſs of any thing
          <lb/>extraordinary in any of them. He then re­
          <lb/>turned, not leſs uneaſy than before his
          <lb/>ſearch. Sometimes the idea of Sir John Bel­

          <lb/>Had <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> diſcovered his intelli­
          <lb/>gence with <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſhe would have ſigni­
          <lb/>fied her diſpleaſure openly and at once. At
          <lb/>length, he ſuppoſed it might be his brother.
          <lb/>This, as Philip Somerive knew the houſe,
          <lb/>appeared the leaſt improbable of all his con­
          <lb/>jectures. But ſtill it was hardly to be ſup­

          <lb/>were now in his power, by which he might
          <lb/>diſturb the happineſs of <persName>Orlando</persName>. Diſſatiſ­
          <lb/>fied with every ſuppoſition, but becoming

          <lb/>waited with impatience for the cuſtomary
          <lb/>time of viſiting <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>. It came,

          <lb/>but that, as it awakened the envy and jea­
          <lb/>louſy of Pattenſon, was likely to put him
          <lb/>upon the watch, and to bring on the very
          <lb/>evil he dreaded. During the day, indeed,
          <lb/>he had now frequent opportunities of ſeeing
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, who was now, unleſs under her
          <lb/>aunt's diſpleaſure, leſs rigorouſly confined
          <lb/>than formerly; but thoſe interviews were
          <lb/>never but in the preſence of a third perſon;
          <lb/>and after what his father had ſaid, and what
          <lb/>had happened on the alarming evening, he
          <lb/>was compelled to be more than ever cau­
          <lb/>tious. Tormented by uncertainty, and per­
          <lb/>plexed by apprehenſions, he paſſed a wretch­
          <lb/>ed afternoon; impatiently waiting till he
          <lb/>could aſcend the turret, and at leaſt, if he
          <lb/>could not ſee <persName>Monimia</persName>, obtain a letter
          <lb/>from her. The hour at length came when
          <lb/>he believed every one in the houſe were
          <lb/>occupied with their own affairs; and hav­

          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, under pretence of being
          <lb/>buſied in writing for his father, he ſtole
          <lb/>ſoftly to the room under that of <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/>and for thence up the ſtairs.</p>
            <p>He liſtened, fearful of again hearing the
          <lb/>indefatigable clack of <persName>Betty</persName>; but every
          <lb/>thing was profoundly ſilent. The letter,
          <lb/>which he had depoſited there, was gone;
          <lb/>but there was no anſwer. He feared Mo­
          <lb/>nimia was ill—the terror, the fatigue of
          <lb/>the preceding night, had been too much
          <lb/>for her. It was dreadful to be within two
          <lb/>or three paces of her, and yet not dare to
          <lb/>enquire.</p>
            <p>Still liſtening ſome time in breathleſs
          <lb/>anxiety, he at length determined to tap
          <lb/>gently at the door; for he was pretty well
          <lb/>convinced ſhe was alone. <persName>Monimia</persName>, who
          <lb/>was really ill, had lain down; but, ſtarting
          <lb/>at the well-known ſignal, ſhe approached
          <lb/>cloſe to the door, and ſaid, <said xml:id="Mon168"><persName>Orlando</persName>!—

          <lb/>dar, but ſhe had a candle on her table,
          <lb/>and <persName>Orlando</persName> was ſhocked to ſee how ill ſhe
          <lb/>looked. He ſpoke of it tenderly to her:
          <lb/>ſhe aſſured him it was only owing to her
          <lb/>having been ſo much fatigued and fright­
          <lb/>ened, and that a night's reſt, if ſhe could

          <lb/>of <persName>Monimia</persName>. As ſoon the houſe was
          <lb/>quiet he returned to the turret, made deſ­
          <lb/>perate by reflecting on her diſtreſs, and
          <lb/>thinking it better to hazard a diſcovery
          <lb/>than to leave her a whole night in ſolicitude
          <lb/>ſo alarming.</p>
            <p><persName>Monimia</persName>, who little expected his return,
          <lb/>admitted him as ſoon as ſhe heard his ſig­
          <lb/>nal. He found her in that ſtate of mind
          <lb/>which allows not the ſufferer to ſhed tears;
          <lb/>pale, and almoſt petrified, ſhe ſat on the ſide
          <lb/>of her bed, with claſped hands and fixed
          <lb/>eyes, while he related to her the whole of a
          <lb/>tranſaction which he wiſhed he could have
          <lb/>concealed from her till the event could be
          <lb/>known. But it was long before he could
          <lb/>perſuade her that the danger was infinitely
          <lb/>leſs than it appeared. It was evident that
          <lb/><persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>, by poſtponing to <name>Thurſ­
            <lb/>day</name> what he might as well have ſettled on

          <lb/>ference of the family he had taken care to
          <lb/>alarm; and rather wiſhed to have the ho­
          <lb/>nour of appearing a man of nice honour
          <lb/>and dauntleſs courage at little expence,
          <lb/>than to run the hazard of maintaining that

          <lb/>young into the army, had paſſed through

          <lb/>intereſt always ſecures. At five-and-thirty
          <lb/>he had a regiment; and as ſome of the
          <lb/>fortunes of uncles and aunts had centred
          <lb/>in him, he was now, at near ſixty, a man of
          <lb/>very large fortune, and ſeemed to want no­
          <lb/>thing to complete his happineſs, but the
          <lb/>power of perſuading others, as he had al­

          <lb/>five-and-thirty ſtill.</p>
            <p>To effect this, and maintain that favour
          <lb/>which he had always been in among the
          <lb/>ladies, was the great object of his life. His
          <lb/>perſon had been celebrated for beauty; and
          <lb/>he deſired to preſerve a pre-eminence,
          <lb/>which was in his opinion ſuperior to any
          <lb/>fame he could derive from his bravery in
          <lb/>the field, or his ability in the ſenate, where
          <lb/>he had long been a member, certainly vot­
          <lb/>ing with the miniſter of the day. He had
          <lb/>a place about the court, at which he was a 
          <lb/>conſtant attendant, and where the ſoftneſs
          <lb/>and elegance of his manners, the pliability
          <lb/>of his political attachments, and his very
          <lb/>considerable intereſt and property, render­
          <lb/>ed him a great favourite.—All the time he
          <lb/>could ſpare from his duty there, he ſeemed
          <lb/>to devote to the ſervice of thoſe faſhionable
          <lb/>women who give the ton, and whoſe favour
          <lb/>he diſputed with the riſing heroes of the
          <lb/>faſhionable world. But he felt in reality
          <lb/>only diſguſt and ſatiety in their company;

          <lb/>of which he was continually in ſearch—and
          <lb/>with his fortune his ſearch could not be
          <lb/>unſucceſsful. He had no ſcruples to deter
          <lb/>him from decoying any young woman whom
          <lb/>he liked, that chance might throw into his
          <lb/>power; but he uſually avoided with care
          <lb/>any ſcheme which was likely to be inter­
          <lb/>rupted by the unpleaſant remonſtrances of
          <lb/>a father or a brother, and generally purſued

            <p>As he purchaſed his wine of <persName>Mr. Wood­

          <lb/>His daughters were rather handſome, and

          <lb/>Their father, who thought more of the good
          <lb/>cuſtomer which the General was himſelf,
          <lb/>and the great families he had recommended
          <lb/>him to, than of any neceſſity for reſerve in
          <lb/>his daughters, encouraged this acquaint­
          <lb/>ance (which their mother was as well
          <lb/>pleaſed with as the young women) till the
          <lb/>neighbourhood talked loudly of their indiſ­
          <lb/>cretion, and till the youngeſt <persName>Miſs Wood­
            <lb/>ford</persName>, who was his peculiar favourite, was
          <lb/>declared by many ladies to have conſidera­
          <lb/>bly injured her reputation. This ſhe her­
          <lb/>ſelf conſidered only as a teſtimony of their
          <lb/>envy, and her own ſuperior attractions; and
          <lb/>the more ſhe heard of their malignant re­
          <lb/>marks, the more eagerly ſhe endeavoured
          <lb/> to ſhew her contempt of their opinion, and
          <lb/>her power over the General, who, on the
          <lb/>return of the family to town after their 
          <lb/>viſit to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, was more than
          <lb/>uſual at the houſe. But thither he was no

          <lb/>other perſon; and though he ſoon learned
          <lb/>that ſhe was in a ſituation of life which
          <lb/>placed her above thoſe temptations which
          <lb/>he generally found infallible, and had a
          <lb/>father and two brothers to protect her, the
          <lb/>impreſſion ſhe had made was ſuch that he
          <lb/>could not determine to loſe ſight of her;
          <lb/>and as the diſcovery of the preference he
          <lb/>gave her had made both her couſins very 
          <lb/>little deſirous of her company in <placeName>London</placeName>
          <lb/>during the winter, where ſhe ſeemed too
          <lb/>likely to rob them of all their conqueſts,
          <lb/>he found ſhe was to return home with her
          <lb/>mother—and thither he reſolved to follow

            <p>An opportunity of introducing himſelf
          <lb/>into the family of <persName>Somerive</persName> was eaſily ob­

          <lb/>county there was at that time no militia,
          <lb/>had, being then an active man, procured a

          <lb/>the defence of the coaſt, where he himſelf
          <lb/>was a captain. They had at that time
          <lb/>been frequently together, and afterwards
          <lb/>kept up ſome degree of intimacy, till <persName>Some­
            <lb/>rive's</persName> marriage fixing him wholly in re­
          <lb/>tirement, the gay and faſhionable ſoldier
          <lb/>thought of him no more.</p>
            <p>The General, however, no ſooner knew
          <lb/>who the viſitors at <persName>Woodford's</persName> were, than
          <lb/>he moſt aſſiduouſly and ſucceſsfully paid
          <lb/>his court to <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>; talked to her
          <lb/>continually of her huſband, whoſe merits he 
          <lb/>affected to remember with infinite regard,
          <lb/>and for whoſe intereſt he appeared to feel
          <lb/>the warmeſt concern. It was a theme of
          <lb/>which <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, who adored her huſ­
          <lb/>band, was never weary; and while <persName>Gene­

          <lb/>terruption of their friendſhip, nothing was

            <p>That was the point he had laboured to

          <lb/>ſhooting ſeaſon to his other inducements,
          <lb/>the better to colour ſo unexpected a viſit.
          <lb/>He had found it convenient to pretend a
          <lb/>great paſſion for field ſports—partly becauſe
          <lb/>it was faſhionable, and partly becauſe it
          <lb/>ſhewed that his powers of enduring fatigue
          <lb/>were equal to the youthful appearance he
          <lb/>aſſumed; and to ſupport this, he now and
          <lb/>then went through, what was to him moſt
          <lb/>miſerable drudgery, that of a day's hunting
          <lb/>or ſhooting; but he more uſually contrived, 
          <lb/>when he was at the houſes of his friends
          <lb/>for theſe purpoſes, to ſprain his ancle in
          <lb/>the firſt excurſion he made, or to hurt him­
          <lb/>ſelf by the recoil of his gun: and by ſuch
          <lb/>methods he generally managed to be left
          <lb/>without ſuſpicion at home with the ladies;
          <lb/>with whom he was ſo univerſal a favourite,
          <lb/>and to whom he had ſo many ways of re­
          <lb/>commending himſelf, by deciding on their
          <lb/>dreſs, reading to them books of entertain­
          <lb/>ment, and relating anecdotes collected in
          <lb/>the higher circles where he moved in the
          <lb/>winter, that he found no loſs of attention

          <lb/>from the progreſs of years—a progreſs
          <lb/>indeed which he took the utmoſt pains to
          <lb/>conceal. His clothes, which were always
          <lb/>made by the moſt eminent taylor, were cut
          <lb/>with as much care as thoſe of the moſt cele­
          <lb/>brated beauty on her firſt appearance at 
          <lb/>court; and he had ſeveral contrivances, of
          <lb/>his own invention, to make them fit with
          <lb/>advantage to his perſon. His hands were
          <lb/>more delicate than thoſe of any lady; and
          <lb/>though he could not ſo totally baffle the
          <lb/>inexorable hands of time as to eſcape a few
          <lb/>wrinkles, he ſtill maintained a conſiderable
          <lb/>ſhare of the bloom of youth, not without
          <lb/>ſuſpicion of Olympian dew, cold cream,
          <lb/>and Spaniſh wool. Certain it is that he 
          <lb/>was very long at his toilet every day, to
          <lb/>which no perſon, not even his valet-de-
          <lb/>chambre, was admitted. With all this he
          <lb/>was a man of the moſt undoubted bravery;
          <lb/>and had not only ſerved in <placeName>Germany</placeName> with
          <lb/>great credit, but had been engaged in ſe­
          <lb/>veral affairs of honour, in which he had

          <lb/>now, from no very honourable motives,
          <lb/>become an inmate in the houſe of <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Somerive</persName>.</p>
            <p>When <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> had appeaſed the
          <lb/>diſtreſs into which his wife was thrown by
          <lb/>the intelligence ſhe had ſo abruptly re­
          <lb/>ceived about <persName>Orlando</persName>, and had prevailed
          <lb/>upon her to compoſe herſelf and appear at
          <lb/>dinner, he returned back to his friend,
          <lb/>whom he found in converſation with <persName>Orlan­
            <lb/>do</persName>; and he determined that he would,
          <lb/>over their wine, relate to him what had
          <lb/>paſſed between <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName> and his
          <lb/>ſon (who had put <persName>Sir John's</persName> laſt letter into
          <lb/>his hands), and take the General's opinion
          <lb/>as to what was fit to be done.</p>
            <p>Dinner was announced, and the ladies
          <lb/>of the family appeared;—the mother, with
          <lb/>ſwollen eyes, which ſhe could not a mo­
          <lb/>ment keep from <persName>Orlando</persName>; and the daugh­
          <lb/>ters appearing to ſympathize with her; par­
          <lb/>ticularly <persName>Selina</persName>, who was fondly attached to
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, and who, from the terror in which

          <lb/>ſhe ſaw her mother, having caught re­
          <lb/>doubled apprehenſion, could hardly com­
          <lb/>mand her tears; and though the General
          <lb/>failed not to compliment her on her beauty,
          <lb/>which even exceeded that of her ſiſter, and
          <lb/>to ſpeak in the warmeſt terms to <persName>Mr.</persName> and
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> of their lovely family, <persName>Se­
            <lb/>lina</persName> heeded him not. He obſerved that
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> was leſs inſenſible of his ſtudied
          <lb/>eulogiums, and from thence drew a favour­
          <lb/>able omen. <persName>Emma</persName>, the youngeſt of the
          <lb/>girls, was only between twelve and thir­
          <lb/>teen.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the table-cloth was removed,
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, under pretence of being a
          <lb/>good deal fatigued with her journey, and
          <lb/>ſomewhat indiſpoſed, withdrew with her
          <lb/>daughters: <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> ſoon after gave
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> a hint to go alſo; and then he
          <lb/>opened to <persName>General Tracy</persName> the affair which
          <lb/>lay ſo heavy on his heart, and entreated his
          <lb/>advice how to act.</p>

            <lb/>concern, which was ſo evident at dinner,
            <lb/>as well as that of her amiable daughters,
            <lb/>that I was afraid ſome very diſagreeable
            <lb/>incident had happened in the family.</said></p>
            <p><said>And is not,</said> ſaid <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>,
          <lb/><said>what I have related diſagreeable
            <lb/>enough?</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>No, upon my honor! I ſee nothing
            <lb/>in it but what is rather a matter of exulta­
            <lb/>tion. Your ſon is one of the fineſt and moſt
            <lb/>ſpirited young men I ever ſaw. If he was
            <lb/>a ſon of my own, I ſhould rejoice that he
            <lb/>had acted ſo properly, and be very proud
            <lb/>of him.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>But you would not riſk his life, ſurely?</said><lb/>ſaid <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>.</p>
            <p><said>Why, as to that,</said> replied the General,
          <lb/><said>in theſe caſes there is ſome little riſk, to
            <lb/>be ſure; but I ſhould never check a lad of

          <lb/><said>He will fight, if he muſt—but I believe
            <lb/>is quite as willing to let it alone.</said></p>
            <p><said>It will break my wife's heart,</said> ſaid
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> dejectedly, and amazed at
          <lb/>the different light in which two people,
          <lb/>from their different modes of life, conſider
          <lb/>the ſame object; <said>it will certainly break
            <lb/>my wife's heart, if any evil befalls <persName>Orlan­

            <p><persName>General Tracy</persName> now ſaw that an oppor­

          <lb/>obligation on the family, which muſt ſe­
          <lb/>cure their endleſs gratitude, and he reſolv­
          <lb/>ed to embrace it.</p>
            <p><said>If it makes you all ſo uneaſy,</said> replied
          <lb/>he, after a moment's pauſe, <said>and eſpe­
            <lb/>cially if her fears make <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> ſo
            <lb/>very wretched, ſuppoſe we try what can be
            <lb/>done to put an end to the affair without a

            <lb/>induced, on the ſlighteſt apology, to drop

            <p><said>He is right,</said> anſwered the General;
          <lb/><said>and I honour him for his reſolution. It
            <lb/>is a thouſand pities,</said> continued he, again
          <lb/>pauſing, <said>that ſuch a gloriouſly ſpirited
            <lb/>young fellow ſhould waſte his life in ſeclu­
            <lb/>ſion, waiting on the caprices of an old wo­
            <lb/>man――What do you intend to do with
            <lb/>him?</said></p>
            <p><said>That,</said> ſaid <persName>Somerive</persName>, <said>is what I have
            <lb/>long been in doubt about. I had thoughts
            <lb/>once of putting him into trade; but to that
            <lb/>project <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> objections, and <persName>Or­
              <lb/>lando's</persName> little inclination to follow it, put an
            <lb/>end.</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>I am glad they did; for it would have
            <lb/>been a ſad ſacrifice, I think, to have ſet ſo

            <p><said>And at other times,</said> re-aſſumed <persName>Mr.

            <lb/>quently to her my wiſhes on this ſubject,
            <lb/>ſhe never would underſtand me, to give me
            <lb/>any aſſurance that ſhe would ſecure him a
            <lb/>living; or made any offer of aſſiſtance to
            <lb/>ſupport him at the univerſity, which ſhe
            <lb/>knows that it is quite impoſſible for me,
            <lb/>circumſtanced as I am at preſent, to do.</said></p>
            <p><said>She was in the right of it,</said> cried the
          <lb/>General. <said>The old lady has more ſaga­
            <lb/>city than I ſuſpected, and knows that it
            <lb/>would be abſolutely a ſin to make him a 
            <lb/>parſon, and bury all that ſenſe and ſpirit in
            <lb/>a country vicarage. Why, my good friend,
            <lb/>do you not put your ſon into the army?—
            <lb/>that ſeems to be the profeſsion for which
            <lb/>nature has deſigned him.</said></p>
            <p><said>Becauſe,</said> anſwered <persName>Somerive,</persName> <said>I

            <lb/>kill his mother, and take him out of the 
            <lb/>way of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, which appears to be

            <lb/>him,</said> ſaid <persName>General Tracy</persName>, <said>do you think
            <lb/>the other objections ought to weigh much?
            <lb/>Conſider it, my good friend; and if you
            <lb/>think ſuch a plan would be eligible, and
            <lb/>the young man himſelf likes it, perhaps it
            <lb/>may be in my power to be of ſome uſe to
            <lb/>you.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> warmly expreſſed his gra­

          <lb/>to take in the welfare of his <persName>Orlando</persName>; and
          <lb/>then, after a ſhort ſilence, ſaid: <said>But, my

            <lb/>ning ſchemes for the future life of <persName>Orlando</persName>,
            <lb/>it may be terminated to-morrow.</said></p>
            <p><said>Well,</said> replied he, <said>ſince I ſee you

            <lb/>If I ſay to the doughty baronet, that his

          <lb/>march to overtake the three <persName>Miſs Somerives</persName>,
          <lb/>to whom he related ſome part of the con­

          <lb/>ed, if his art could effect it. His eagerneſs,
          <lb/>however, to ſerve <persName>Orlando</persName>, had another
          <lb/>motive than this of retribution. He foreſaw
          <lb/>that ſo ſpirited a young man might prevent,
<lb/>or, not being able to do that, would very
<lb/>ſeriouſly reſent his deſigns upon a ſiſter:
<lb/>the character of the elder brother, of which
<lb/>he had by this time formed a pretty clear
<lb/>idea, left him little to apprehend from him;
          <lb/>but the fiery and impetuous <persName>Orlando</persName> would,
<lb/>he thought, be much better out of the
<lb/>way.</p>
            <p>His converſation with the <persName>Miſs Some­

<lb/>py did he feel himſelf with three ſuch

<lb/>ſummons which called them in to attend
<lb/>the tea-table.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, who had now been long
<lb/>in conference with her huſband, and after­
          <lb/>wards with <persName>Orlando</persName>, appeared much more

<lb/>which expreſſed how much ſhe was obliged

<lb/>to him for the interference he had pro­
<lb/>miſed. The evening paſſed off pleaſantly.
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> stayed to ſupper; but then told his
<lb/>father, that he had ſome buſineſs to do
          <lb/>for <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> early the next day
<lb/>(which was true), and therefore he would
          <lb/>return to the Hall that evening. <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Somerive</persName>, who ſtill felt a dread which he
<lb/>could not conquer, entreated him to give
<lb/>his word of honour, that he would not
          <lb/>throw himſelf in the way of <persName>Sir John Bel­
<lb/>grave</persName> till the hour of that gentleman's ap­
          <lb/>pointment. This <persName>Orlando</persName> (who was igno­
<lb/>rant of the plans in agitation to prevent
<lb/>that appointment from taking place at all)
<lb/>thought himſelf obliged to comply with:
<lb/>on which condition his father, though
<lb/>reluctantly, ſuffered him at midnight to
          <lb/>mount his horſe and return to <placeName>Rayland
            <lb/>Hall</placeName>, where he had deſired <persName>Betty</persName> to sit up

<lb/>he put his horſe into a gallop, impatient

            <p>He then, without attending to her far­

<lb/>from this uncertainty. This ſhe found it

<lb/>reſtleſs and diſſatisfied: he complained of
<lb/>the miſery he underwent in his frequent

<lb/>was compelled to make. He expreſſed
<lb/>impatiently the long unhappineſs he had
<lb/>in proſpect, if he could never ſee her but

<lb/>however, ſoothed him, by bidding him re­

<lb/>that was preſent. But all that had paſſed
<lb/>during the day, had aſſiſted in making him

<lb/>to convince him that, in being of ſo much

<lb/>When he reflected on his ſituation, he be­

<lb/>of waſting the beſt of his days in the hope
<lb/>of that which might never happen; while
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, almoſt a priſoner in her little

            <p>It was theſe thoughts that gave to <persName>Orlan­

<lb/>o'clock. He glided ſoftly down ſtairs; and
<lb/>when he came out of the lower room of

<lb/>that he could not ſee his hand. He knew
<lb/>the way, however, ſo well, that he walked

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, who had taken his hanger from

<lb/>put his piſtols, which were both loaded, by

<lb/>ruffian, felt ſomething like horror. His
<lb/>dark countenance ſhaded by two immenſe
<lb/>black eyebrows, his ſhaggy hair, and the
<lb/>fierce and wild expreſſion of his eyes, gave
          <lb/>a complete idea of one of <persName>Shakeſpeare's</persName>
<lb/>well-painted aſſaſſins; while, in contem­
          <lb/>plating his athletic form, <persName>Orlando</persName> wonder­
<lb/>ed how he had been able a moment to de­
<lb/>tain him. He wore a dirty round frock
<lb/>ſtained with ochre which looked like blood,
<lb/>and over it one of thoſe thick great coats
          <lb/>which the vulgar call raſcal-wrappers. <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> poured him out a tumbler of wine,
<lb/>and bade him ſit down. The fellow obey­
<lb/>ed, drank off his wine; and then, after
<lb/>ſurveying the room, ſaid, turning with a 
          <lb/>ſly look to <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>What, Maſter, ſhe
<lb/>ben't here then to-night?</said></p>
            <p><said>Pooh, pooh!</said> cried <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>let's

            <p>He then plied him with another full

<lb/>him on his exploits. He found him one
<lb/>of thoſe daring and deſperate men, who,
<lb/>knowing they are to expect no mercy, diſ­
<lb/>claim all hope, and reſolutely prey upon
<lb/>the ſociety which has ſhaken them off. He

<lb/>him, and the voice of kindneſs with which

<lb/>among the ſmugglers, and deriving very
<lb/>conſiderable ſums from the ſhelter they
<lb/>afforded them, and the participation of
          <lb/>their illicit gains. <persName>Orlando</persName> found, that
<lb/>during the whole winter, in weather when

<lb/>carried their cargoes through the country,
<lb/>in weather when <quote source="b:IT00525">one's enemy's dog</quote>
<lb/>would hardly be turned from the door.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, after ſome conſideration on the
<lb/>means of eſcaping that interruption which
<lb/>this combination amon the ſervants in the 
<lb/>houſe ſeemed to threaten, told the man, as
<lb/>if in confidence, that under the reſtraint he
          <lb/>was in, in <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> houſe, he ſome­
<lb/>times found it convenient to go out after
<lb/>the family were in bed, to ſee at a neigh­
          <lb/>bouring town ſome friends whom <persName>Mrs.

<lb/>ſhould not wiſh to interrupt you, you
<lb/>would give me ſome ſignal on thoſe nights
<lb/>when you are at work in the cellar.</said></p>
            <p>This the ſmuggler readily promiſed, and
<lb/>they agreed upon the ſign which ſhould sig­

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, poſſeſſing this ſecret, flattered

<lb/>quaintance would keep his word, and that
<lb/>the communication between the ſtudy and
          <lb/>the apartment of <persName>Monimia</persName> might once
<lb/>more be open, without making her liable
<lb/>to thoſe terrors from which ſhe had ſuffered
<lb/>ſo much.</p>
            <p>The man, whom <persName>Orlando</persName> continued to
<lb/>behold with a mixture of horror and pity,
<lb/>was now nearly overcome with the wine he
<lb/>had drank, and began to relate long proſing
<lb/>ſtories of his eſcapes and his exploits, in
<lb/>which he related inſtances of dauntleſs cou­
<lb/>rage, tarniſhed however by brutiſh ferocity.
          <lb/>At length <persName>Orlando</persName> reminded him that day

<lb/>was ſoon approaching, and ſaw him out of 
<lb/>the chapel-door, repeating his aſſurances
<lb/>that nothing of what he had himſelf that
          <lb/>night diſcovered ſhould tranſpire. <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>then faſtened the chapel and the other
<lb/>doors, and betook himſelf to his repoſe—
<lb/>thinking leſs about the meeting that was to
<lb/>take place, as he believed, on the morrow,
<lb/>than on the recent diſcovery he had made,
<lb/>which nearly quieted his terrors in regard
          <lb/>to <persName>Monimia's</persName> having been ſeen; and he
<lb/>impatiently longed for an opportunity to
<lb/>communicate to her the ſatisfaction which
<lb/>he hoped ſhe would derive from this aſ­
<lb/>ſurance.</p>
            <p>The late hour at which he had gone to
<lb/>bed, and the fatigue of mind he had expe­

          <lb/>be later than uſual when <persName>Orlando</persName> awoke.
<lb/>He ſtarted up; and recollecting that he had

<lb/>ceived a ſummons to attend his father, who
<lb/>waited for him as uſual in the ſtable-yard.</p>
            <p>He found <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> again on horſe­
<lb/>back, and eaſily underſtood that his pur­
<lb/>poſe was to keep him from his appoint­
<lb/>ment, to which however he was poſitively
<lb/>determined to go. While his father, in a 
<lb/>peculiar ſtrain of dejection and concern,
<lb/>was yet talking to him as he leaned on the 
          <lb/>horſe, <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> ſaw them from one

            <p>This invitation, ſo flattering becauſe ſo

          <lb/>knew that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was acquainted
<lb/>with the affair which hung over him with
<lb/>an aſpect ſo threatening, and hoped that ſhe 
          <lb/>would unite with him in perſuading <persName>Orlan­
<lb/>do</persName> to thoſe conceſſions which might yet
<lb/>afford the means of evading it, if the Ge­

<lb/>which, he found her elated with the idea of
          <lb/>puniſhing the audacity of <persName>Sir John</persName>, fearleſs
<lb/>of any danger which in the attempt might
          <lb/>happen to <persName>Orlando</persName>, and piqueing herſelf
<lb/>on the ſuppoſition that in him had revived
<lb/>a ſpark of that martial and dauntleſs ſpirit
<lb/>which ſhe had been taught to believe cha­
<lb/>racteriſed the men of her family. She
<lb/>ſeemed ſurpriſed, and ſomewhat offended,
          <lb/>at the alarm <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> expreſſed; and
<lb/>hinted, in no very equivocal terms, that this
<lb/>timidity was the effect of that mixture of
<lb/>plebeian blood, from the alloy of which
          <lb/>only <persName>Orlando</persName>, of all the family, ſeemed
          <lb/>exempt: while <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, in his turn,
<lb/>beheld, with a degree of horror and diſ­
<lb/>guſt, a woman who, to gratify her pride, or
<lb/>revenge her quarrel, on ſo trifiling a ſubject,
<lb/>was ready to promote perhaps the death
<lb/>of one for whom ſhe had appeared to feel
<lb/>ſome degree of affection.</p>
            <p>With views and opinions ſo different,
<lb/>their conference was not likely to be either
          <lb/>very long or very ſatisfactory. <persName>Mr. Some­

            <lb/>rive</persName> knew, that when <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had
<lb/>once taken up an opinion, argument againſt
<lb/>it offended, but never convinced her; and
<lb/>that in proportion as her reaſoning was fee­
<lb/>ble, her reſolution was firm. Thus baffled
<lb/>in his hopes of her effectual interpoſition,
          <lb/>and ſeeing that <persName>Orlando</persName> was bent upon
<lb/>keeping his appointment, of which the
          <lb/>hour was now at hand, <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> ſat
<lb/>awhile ſilent, mortified and wretched—
<lb/>hoping, yet fearing, for the ſucceſs of the
<lb/>General's interpoſition, and conſidering
<lb/>what he ſhould do if it failed.</p>
            <p>He had juſt determined to obtain a war­
<lb/>rant immediately, and to put both parties
<lb/>under arreſt, when a ſervant brought to

<lb/>his hands the letter he had received, at the
<lb/>ſame time telling him that he muſt be
<lb/>obeyed in the command he laid upon him,
<lb/>to make immediately the conceſſion re­

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, convinced that he ought to do
<lb/>ſo, after the appeal he had himſelf conſent­
<lb/>ed to make to the General, aſſured his fa­

              <lb/>mother conſented, if <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> did
<lb/>not object――</said></p>
            <p><said>My good friend,</said> interrupted the Ge­
            <lb/>neral, <said>can a man of your underſtanding,
<lb/>when the well-doing of ſuch a ſon is in
              <lb/>queſtion, think that theſe <emph>ifs</emph> ſhould have
              <lb/>any weight?—<persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, all tender as
<lb/>ſhe is, has too much ſenſe to indulge
<lb/>her fondneſs at the expence of her ſon's eſta­
              <lb/>bliſhment; and as to <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>—I have
<lb/>not indeed the honour to know her—but 
<lb/>the only queſtion ſeems to be, will ſhe, or
              <lb/>will ſhe not, provide for <persName>Orlando</persName>?—<emph>If</emph> ſhe
<lb/>will, why will ſhe not ſay ſo?—If ſhe will
<lb/>not, are not you doing your ſon an irre­
<lb/>parable injury, in ſuffering him to waſte, in 
<lb/>fruitleſs expectation, the beſt of his days?</said></p>
            <p><said>It is very difficult,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Some­

<lb/>ſince I ſee ſhe piques herſelf on the mili­
<lb/>tary honours of her family, perhaps ſhe
              <lb/>may not be diſpleaſed at <persName>Orlando's</persName> entering
<lb/>on the profeſſion of arms. She ſeemed
<lb/>much more eager to promote than to check
              <lb/>his ardour in this affair with <persName>Sir John Bel­
<lb/>grave</persName>: and as the Britiſh nation is now
<lb/>engaged in a quarrel with people whom ſhe
              <lb/>conſiders as the deſcendents of the Regicides,
<lb/>againſt whom her anceſtors drew their
<lb/>ſwords, it is not, I think, very unlikely that
<lb/>ſhe might approve of her young favourite's
<lb/>making his firſt eſſay in arms againſt
              <lb/>thoſe whom ſhe terms the <said rend="pre()post()">Rebels of <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Ame­

            <p><said>As to that,</said> anſwered the General
          <lb/> coldly, <said>it may be very well, in ſtarting
<lb/>the idea, to give her that notion; but in
<lb/>fact this campaign will end the unworthy
<lb/>conteſt.—Of this I have the moſt poſitive

<lb/>lows, without diſcipline, money, clothes,

<lb/>no more troops will be ſent out, your
<lb/>ſon will not, if you adopt this plan, be ſe­
<lb/>parated from his family, and may ſtill oc­
<lb/>caſionally viſit this capricious old gentlewo­
<lb/>man, who, unleſs ſhe differs much from the

<lb/>will not like a handſome young fellow the

            <p><said>Ah, General!</said> returned <persName>Somerive</persName>
          <lb/>ſmiling, <said>I fancy your own experience
<lb/>among the women well juſtifies that re­

            <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> would not be ſent abroad, which
<lb/>will make a great difference certainly in
<lb/>his mother's feelings on this point, and
            <lb/>perhaps in thoſe of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, I will
<lb/>take an immediate opportunity of ſpeaking
<lb/>of it to my wife, and we will conſider of
            <lb/>the ſafeſt method of taking <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName>
            <lb/>opinion upon it. As to <persName>Orlando</persName> himſelf,

<lb/>there can be little doubt of his concur­
<lb/>rence;—at leaſt I hope not. And there are
<lb/>other reaſons, my friend, beſides thoſe that
<lb/>I have named to you, why his preſent
<lb/>ſituation is utterly improper, and why it
<lb/>ſeems to me that he cannot too ſoon be
<lb/>removed from it.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, in ſpeaking thus, was
          <lb/>thinking of <persName>Monimia</persName>, who, ever ſince he
<lb/>had firſt heard her deſcribed, had occurred
<lb/>to him continually. The neceſſity there
<lb/>was for attending immediately to the affair
<lb/>of the threatened duel, had hitherto pre­
          <lb/>vented his ſpeaking of her to <persName>Orlando</persName>, in
<lb/>that ſerious manner which he thought the
<lb/>affair merited: but he had repeatedly
          <lb/>touched on it; and finding <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhrink
<lb/>from the inveſtigation, he laid in wait for 
<lb/>an occaſion to probe him more deeply—an
<lb/>occaſion which, perceiving his father ſought
          <lb/>it, <persName>Orlando</persName> as ſolicitouſly endeavoured to
<lb/>avoid giving him, by contriving to be
<lb/>always buſied in attending on his ſiſters or
<lb/>his mother; but while he thus got out of

<lb/>the way of his father, he was very much
<lb/>in that of the General, who could hardly
<lb/>ever get an opportunity of whiſpering to
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> thoſe ſentiments which daily ac­
<lb/>quired new force. For, the week following
          <lb/>that when the affair with <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>
          <lb/>was ſettled, <persName>Orlando</persName> could find no excuſe
          <lb/>for returning to <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName> of a night:
<lb/>he was therefore reduced to the neceſſity of
<lb/>going thither after his own family were in
<lb/>bed; and as the way through the chapel 
<lb/>was not open to him, he could only ſee
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> in her own room, and their meet­
<lb/>ings were therefore very ſhort, and ſo ha­
<lb/>zardous, that the impatience and diſcon­
          <lb/>tent of <persName>Orlando</persName> could no longer be re­
<lb/>preſſed or concealed.</p>
            <p>The greater his attachment to <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>became (and every hour it ſeemed to gather
<lb/>ſtrength), the more terrible appeared her
<lb/>ſituation, and his own. They were both
<lb/>ſo young that he thought he might eaſily
<lb/>obtain an eſtabliſhment, and that the noon
<lb/>of their lives might paſs in felicity together,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">53</mw>
<lb/>were he, inſtead of remaining in a ſtate of
<lb/>uncertain dependence, to be allowed to go
<lb/>forth into the world. Sanguine and romantic
<lb/>in the extreme, and feeling within himſelf
<lb/>talents which he was denied the power of
<lb/>exerciſing, his mind expatiated on viſionary
<lb/>proſpects, which he believed might eaſily
<lb/>be realized. When to provide for paſſing 
          <lb/>his life with <persName>Monimia</persName> was in queſtion, every
<lb/>thing ſeemed poſſible; and as he heard much
          <lb/>of the rapid fortunes made in <placeName>India</placeName>, and
<lb/>had never conſidered, or perhaps heard of
<lb/>the means by which they were acquired, he
<lb/>fancied that an appointment there would
<lb/>put him in the high road to happineſs;
<lb/>and various were the projects of this and
<lb/>of many other kinds, on which his thoughts
<lb/>continually dwelt.</p>
            <p><persName>General Tracy</persName>, who had long read man­
<lb/>kind, eaſily penetrated into the mind of
          <lb/>a man ſo new to the world as <persName>Orlando</persName>;
<lb/>and though he ſaw that his young friend
<lb/>did not greatly eſteem him, he was not by 
<lb/>that obſervation deterred from conciliating

<lb/>as much as poſſible his good opinion, till
          <lb/>at length <persName>Orlando</persName> communicated his diſ­
<lb/>content at being at his time of life ſo inac­
<lb/>tive and uſeleſs; and the General, having
<lb/>brought him to that confeſſion, ſtarted the
<lb/>ſcheme he had before propoſed only to his
<lb/>father, of procuring him a commiſſion, and
<lb/>lending him all the intereſt which he was 
<lb/>known to poſſeſs, to promote his fortune in
<lb/>the army.</p>
            <p>A propoſal ſo friendly, and ſo much adapt­
          <lb/>ed to the warm and ardent temper of <persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName>, was acknowledged with gratitude,
<lb/>and without farther conſideration embraced,
<lb/>on condition that his family did not oppoſe
<lb/>it. The General told him, that it was in
<lb/>conſequence of his father's apparent incli­
<lb/>nations that he had at firſt thought of it;
<lb/>that his mother had certainly too much
<lb/>ſenſe to reject ſuch an advantageous offer
          <lb/>for him; <said>eſpecially,</said> added he, <said>as from
<lb/>the preſent ſtate of the war, there is not the
<lb/>leaſt likelihood of your being ſent abroad.
<lb/>—You know beſt, however, my dear Sir,</said>
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">continued</mw>
<pb n="2055"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">55</mw>
<lb/>continued the General, with ſomething on
<lb/>his countenance between a ſmile and a
          <lb/>ſneer— <said>you know beſt how far your cam­
            <lb/>paigns againſt the game on the <persName>Raylands'</persName> ma­
<lb/>nors may anſwer better than the ſervices of
<lb/>a ſoldier, or whether the old lady's hands
<lb/>can beſtow a more fruitful prize than the
<lb/>barren laurels you may gather in bearing
<lb/>arms for your country.</said></p>
            <p>There was in this ſpeech ſomething that
          <lb/>conveyed to <persName>Orlando</persName> an idea that he was
<lb/>deſpiſed; and that there was meanneſs in
          <lb/>his attending on <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> like a le­
<lb/>gacy hunter—of all characters the moſt deſ­
<lb/>picable. The blood that ruſhed into his
<lb/>cheeks, ſpoke the painful ſenſations this
<lb/>impreſſion brought with it. He could not,
<lb/>however, expreſs them with propriety to
<lb/>a man whoſe only purpoſe ſeemed to be
<lb/>that of befriending him, by rouſing him
<lb/>from indolence, and even from a ſpecies of
<lb/>ſervitude. The General ſaw that what he
          <lb/>ſaid had the effect he wiſhed; and <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> left him, determined to avail himſelf

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">56</mw>
<lb/>of the opportunity that now offered for ob­
<lb/>taining what he believed would be a degree
<lb/>of independence. He began to conſider
          <lb/>how he might prevail on <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> to
<lb/>aſſiſt, inſtead of oppoſing this ſcheme; and
<lb/>how he might thus obtain a certain portion
<lb/>of liberty, without offending one to whom
<lb/>gratitude and intereſt contributed to attach
<lb/>him. A deep and painful ſigh, raiſed by
<lb/>the reflection of the miſery of parting from
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, followed the reſolution he adopt­
<lb/>ed; but he recollected that by no other
<lb/>means he could remove the cruel obſtacles
<lb/>between them, and that reſolution became
<lb/>confirmed.</p>
            <p>He had not yet, however, the courage to 
<lb/>communicate to her the probability there
<lb/>was that they muſt ſoon part. Their ſhort
<lb/>conferences, in every one of which they in­
<lb/>curred the hazard of diſcovery, paſſed, on 
<lb/>her ſide, in mournful preſentiments of future
<lb/>ſorrow, which ſhe yet endeavoured to con­
<lb/>ceal; and on his, in trying, now to conſole
<lb/>her, and now in acknowledging that there

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">57</mw>
<lb/>was but too much cauſe for her fears: pro­
<lb/>jects were conſidered, however, for their fu­
<lb/>ture meetings with leſs riſk. She told him,
<lb/>that during the time he was ſo much at
<lb/>home, her aunt confined her leſs ſtrictly
<lb/>through the day; that in proportion as
<lb/>ſhe found herſelf become more neceſſary to
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and more ſecure of a pro­
          <lb/>viſion after her death, <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> be­
<lb/>came more indolent, and more addicted to
          <lb/>her own gratifications. <persName>Betty</persName>, who was a 
<lb/>very great favourite, had little elſe to do
<lb/>than to wait upon her; an employment in
          <lb/>which <persName>Monimia</persName> herſelf was often engaged,
<lb/>though ſhe was now more uſually employ­
          <lb/>ed about the perſon of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, who
<lb/>found her ſo tender and attentive that ſhe
<lb/>began to look upon her with ſome degree 
<lb/>of complacency. This taſk, while it added
<lb/>a heavy link to her fetters, ſhe yet went
<lb/>through, not only with patience, but with
<lb/>pleaſure; for ſhe hoped that by making
          <lb/>herſelf uſeful to <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, ſhe might
<lb/>not only have more frequent opportunities

          <lb/>of ſeeing <persName>Orlando</persName> during the winter, which
          <lb/>ſhe imagined he would paſs at the Hall,
<lb/>but perhaps obtain from her ſuch a ſhare
<lb/>of recollection at her death, as might re­
<lb/>move the neceſſity of an entire dependence
          <lb/>on <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>; a dependence which
<lb/>ſome late obſervations had made her be­
<lb/>lieve as precarious as ſhe felt it to be pain­
<lb/>ful.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of <persName>General Tracy's</persName> viſit
          <lb/>to <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName> at the houſe of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Stockton</persName>, he received from the maſter of

<lb/>had a fortune to ſupport, attracted not 
          <lb/>only all his <placeName>London</placeName> friends by<choice><sic/><corr> </corr></choice>turns to his

<lb/>quaintance who deſired nothing better, in
<lb/>the way of entertainment, than his French
<lb/>cook and his well furniſhed cellars af­
          <lb/>forded them.—The Clergy were his very
<lb/>conſtant gueſts; and he loved to have two
<lb/>or three of them always about him, at
<lb/>whom he might lanch thoſe ſhafts of wit
<lb/>which he had picked up here and there,
<lb/>and which conſiſted of common-place jokes
<lb/>upon religion; well knowing, that with
<lb/>theſe ſelect few, orthodox as they were, the
<lb/>excellence of the entertainment he gave
<lb/>them ſecured their ſilence and complai­
<lb/>ſance.</p>
            <p>The General, who was in manners really
<lb/>a man of faſhion, was by no means delight­
<lb/>ed with the groſs and noiſy ſociety he found

<lb/>eſcape ſuſpicion, he muſt not make his viſit
          <lb/>at <persName>Somerive's</persName> too long; and, therefore, was
<lb/>glad to be aſſured that there was an houſe

          <lb/>that of <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>; which he now
<lb/>feared muſt happen before his hopes with
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> were ſucceſsful, for he found it
<lb/>much more difficult to obtain any degree
<lb/>of favour than his own vanity and her gid­
<lb/>dineſs had at firſt led him to ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p><persName>Iſabella Somerive</persName> was not naturally a co­
<lb/>quette: but ſhe had a greater flow of ſpirits
<lb/>than any of her family, except her elder
<lb/>brother, whom ſhe greatly reſembled in the
<lb/>thoughtleſs vivacity of his diſpoſition; but,
<lb/>from her ſex and education, what was in
<lb/>him attended with dangerous errors, was in
<lb/>her only wild but innocent gaiety, becom­
<lb/>ing enough to youth, health, and beauty. Of
<lb/>that beauty ſhe had early learned the value:
<lb/>ſhe had heared it praiſed at home, and found
<lb/>her father and mother were pleaſed to
<lb/>hear of it. But during her ſhort ſtay in
          <lb/><placeName>London</placeName> ſhe had been intoxicated with the
<lb/>incenſe that was offered her; and, notwith­
<lb/>ſtanding the good humour inherent in her
<lb/>diſpoſition, ſhe failed not to enjoy, with
<lb/>ſome degree of feminine triumph, the pre­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">61</mw>
<lb/>ference that was given her over her couſins,
<lb/>whoſe admirers ſeemed all diſpoſed to de­
<lb/>ſert them on the firſt appearance of this
<lb/>ruſtic beauty; and ſhe felt, too, the plea­
<lb/>ſure of retaliation for all the airs of con­
          <lb/>ſequence which the <persName>Miſs Woodfords</persName> had
          <lb/>aſſumed in their viſits to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>,
<lb/>from their ſuperior knowledge of faſhions,
<lb/>public places, and great people. But, above
          <lb/>all, <persName>Iſabella</persName> was delighted by the preference
          <lb/>given her by a judge ſo diſcerning as <persName>Ge­
<lb/>neral Tracy</persName>—whoſe taſte in beauty was ſo
<lb/>univerſally allowed, that his admiration had
<lb/>given eminence to ſeveral pretty women,
<lb/>who would never otherwiſe have been no­
<lb/>ticed. Far however from thinking of him
          <lb/>as a lover, <persName>Iſabella</persName>, who was, with all her
          <lb/>vivacity, as innocent as little <persName>Emma</persName> herſelf,
<lb/>thought of him merely as her father's
<lb/>friend, and would have applied to him for
<lb/>advice, in as much expectation of receiv­
<lb/>ing it with diſintereſted wiſdom, as to her
<lb/>father himſelf. The fine ſpeeches he took
<lb/>every opportunity of making, ſhe conſidered

<lb/>partly as ariſing from habit, and partly as 
<lb/>proofs of his admiration; which ſhe be­
<lb/>lieved perfectly harmleſs, though it ſome­
<lb/>times ſtruck her as ridiculous. And in con­
<lb/>verſation with her ſiſters, and ſometimes
<lb/>with her mother, ſhe laughingly called the
<lb/>General—her old beau—her venerable ad­
<lb/>mirer, and ſaid ſhe wiſhed he was thirty
          <lb/>years younger. <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> ſometimes
<lb/>checked her; but oftener ſmiled at the de­
<lb/>ſcription ſhe gave of the General's ſolemn
<lb/>gallantry, and of the trouble ſhe knew his

          <lb/>who was preſent at this deſcription, <said>how
<lb/>you run on! The General, I dare ſay, has
<lb/>no falſe hair; and if he has, how does it
<lb/>materially differ from a wig?</said></p>
            <p><said>Oh mamma!</said> replied her daughter, <said>I
<lb/>believe it differs ſo much in the General's

          <lb/>ing the eſtates of <persName>Lord Carloraine</persName>. For
          <lb/>this <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> had ſeveral reaſons.
<lb/>Though he diſdained any mean complian­
          <lb/>ces with the caprices of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, he
<lb/>thought it wrong to connect himſelf with a 
<lb/>man who, on his firſt appearance in the
<lb/>country, had offended her unhandſomely
<lb/>enough; and he knew it would not only be
<lb/>impolitic in regard to her, but to the
<lb/>economy of his own family. His ſervants,
<lb/>plain and laborious, were at preſent content
<lb/>with their portion of work and of wages; 
<lb/>but were they once introduced into ſuch a
<lb/>ſervants hall as that of the Caſtle, where

<lb/>the ſame profuſion reigned as was cuſto­
<lb/>mary in the parlour, he knew they would
<lb/>immediately become diſcontented, and of 
<lb/>courſe troubleſome and uſeleſs. The people
<lb/>whom he found were generally aſſembled
<lb/>at the Caſtle, moſt of them young men,
<lb/>celebrated for their diſſolute manners, were
<lb/>not ſuch as he wiſhed to have introduced
<lb/>to his daughters. And theſe cauſes co­

          <lb/>hood, and was very ſoon more at <placeName>Stockton</placeName>
<lb/>than at home. The ſimple economy of
<lb/>his father's houſe appeared to him a total
<lb/>deprivation of all that a gentleman ought to
<lb/>enjoy; and when contraſted with the vo­

<lb/>not the courage to return to it oftener than
<lb/>want of money compelled him to do; and
<lb/>he forgot that to theſe temporary gratifica­

            <p>It was here he confirmed, by indulgence, 
<lb/>that paſſion for play which he had acquired
          <lb/>at college. The party at <placeName>Carloraine Caſtle</placeName> 
<lb/>paſſed whole nights in gaming, where 
          <lb/>young <persName>Somerive</persName> often loſt, but, alas! ſome­
<lb/>times won; and in the triumph of his ſuc­
<lb/>ceſs, the pain and inconvenience of his ill
<lb/>fortune was forgotten. He learned ſome of
<lb/>thoſe modes of aſcertaining the matter,
<lb/>which he ſaw ſo happily practiſed by others; 
<lb/>and, after ſome time, became, in ſome mea­
<lb/>ſure, one of the initiated, and had, in con­

            <p>After the acquaintance, however, com­

<lb/>him, gave no favourable idea of the so­

<lb/>which to purſue, afforded no pleaſure either

<lb/>reaſons for refuſing, however, could be

<lb/>the old lady; and as his father had been in­

            <p>The table was furniſhed with all that

<lb/>could purchaſe: the greateſt variety of ex­
<lb/>penſive wines; and a ſuperb deſſert finiſhed
<lb/>a repaſt, at which were collected a group
<lb/>as various as their enterntainment, though
<lb/>not ſo well choſen. The beginning of the
<lb/>dinner was paſſed in that ſort of talk which
<lb/>relates ſolely to eating: when that exerciſe
<lb/>relaxed, ſomething like an attempt at con­

<lb/>ſoon languiſhed; and then again revived
<lb/>on topics nearer home—game, poachers,

            <p>This was at length perceived by <persName>Mr.

<lb/>with ſo much difficulty, and had threatened

<lb/>your tendency to romantic quixotiſm,
<lb/>which perhaps I have too much encou­

<p><said>That, Sir, is my misfortune—ſurely
<lb/>not my fault.</said></p>
<p><said>I allow it. It is a misfortune to which

<lb/>I muſt find a profeſſion for you, which
<lb/>ſhall take you out of a ſituation ſo hazard­
            <lb/>ous. I underſtood <persName>General Tracy</persName>, that if

<p><said>Certainly I do not.—And let my

            <lb/>involve <persName>Monimia</persName> in my preſent diffi­

<lb/>ſend me out a volunteer. You ſhall not
<lb/>find me ſhrink from any taſk you may im­
<lb/>poſe upon me. But, in return, I expect not
<lb/>to be compelled to reſign the hope that will

<lb/>own room, and, with mingled ſenſations of
<lb/>reſentment and ſorrow, of anger and de­
<lb/>ſpondency, began to reflect on what had
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">paſſed</mw>
<pb n="2094"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">94</mw>
          <lb/>paſſed during the day. The inſolent lan­
<lb/>guage uſed by <persName>Stockton</persName> ſtung him to the
<lb/>ſoul. He ſaw too evidently, that his nightly
          <lb/>meetings with <persName>Monimia</persName> were ſuſpected, if
<lb/>not known—known to the unprincipled
          <lb/>and profligate <persName>Stockton</persName>, who had put the
<lb/>moſt odious conſtruction on the conduct of
          <lb/>the innocent <persName>Monimia</persName>. Yet he was com­
<lb/>pelled alſo to allow, that whatever might be
<lb/>the ſuſpicions or opinions concerning her,
<lb/>he could not avenge or defend her, with­
<lb/>out being too well aſſured that conſequen­
<lb/>ces muſt enſue ſtill more fatal to her. If
          <lb/>their intercourſe was once ſuſpected by 
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, he knew that <persName>Monimia</persName> 
<lb/>would be diſmiſſed with diſgrace; that ſhe
<lb/>would probably be abandoned by her aunt,
<lb/>and thrown upon the world, where he had
<lb/>not the power of protecting her from po­
<lb/>verty, though he might guard her from 
<lb/>inſult. The only comfort he had was, that
<lb/>his father, when his interrogatories ſeemed
<lb/>moſt hardly to preſs him to declare how
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">and</mw>
<pb n="2095"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E12r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">95</mw>
          <lb/>and where he met <persName>Monimia</persName>, had been di­
<lb/>verted to other diſcourſe; that he had,
<lb/>therefore, not been reduced either to tell
<lb/>him a falſehood, or to betray the ſecret of
<lb/>the door which admitted him to the turret;
<lb/>a ſecret of which he yet hoped to avail him­
<lb/>ſelf, in the interval that muſt occur between
<lb/>the time of his returning to the Hall and his
<lb/>departure for the army, which he now ſaw 
<lb/>was certain. He now felt no wiſh more ar­
          <lb/>dent than that of reconciling his <persName>Monimia</persName> 
<lb/>to his going, exchanging with her mutual
<lb/>vows of eternal affection, and ſetting forth
<lb/>in the certainty of her remaining under the 
          <lb/>protection of <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, and in the 
<lb/>hope that he ſhould return in a ſituation
<lb/>that might enable him to aſk her hand,
<lb/>and to render her ſubſequent life as happy 
<lb/>as the fondeſt love and competent fortune
          <lb/>could make it. But <persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw too plain­
<lb/>ly, that if his evening conferences were
<lb/>known to his father, he would, at whatever
          <lb/>riſk of ruining him for ever with <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName>, put an end to them; and therefore,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">96</mw>
<lb/>as more caution than ever was requiſite, he
<lb/>determined, for one night, to refrain from
<lb/>the ſhort and dangerous indulgence he had
          <lb/>ſnatched by travelling from <placeName>Wolverton</placeName> to
<lb/>the Hall in the middle of the night; and,
          <lb/>though <persName>Monimia</persName> expected him, to forbear
<lb/>ſeeing her till the next evening, when he
<lb/>hoped to have arranged in his mind what
<lb/>it was the moſt neceſſary to ſay, to make
<lb/>her ſubmit with compoſure to their ſepara­
<lb/>tion. Then too he hoped to know ſome­
<lb/>thing certain of this commiſſion, of which
<lb/>the General hourly expected intelligence 
          <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName>; and that he ſhould not, by
<lb/>ſpeaking with uncertainty, add ſuſpenſe to
<lb/>the other uneaſy ſenſations he muſt inflict
          <lb/>on <persName>Monimia</persName>. He flattered himſelf alſo, that
<lb/>he ſhould hear of the General's having
<lb/>fixed the day of his departure. He had
          <lb/>now been a fortnight at <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>;

<lb/>his heart, as to what ſhe muſt feel at part­

            <p>No overture on the affair of his accepting

<lb/>that much depended upon it, and unwilling 
<lb/>to take any deciſive ſtep, however neceſ­
<lb/>ſary, as long as he could avoid it, had ſtill
<lb/>put it off from hour to hour; ſaying, what
<lb/>was indeed true, that he was now ſo ſel­

            <p>The next day, however, but one after

<lb/>mily received him with ſuch expreſſions as
<lb/>evinced that they were ready to kill the

<lb/>and feaſting when he who had been loſt
<lb/>was found. Yet this did not ariſe altoge­
<lb/>ther from the diſintereſted generoſity of his
<lb/>nature. He would at any time have re­

<lb/>ſupper to my father, try to remember what
<lb/>he ſays.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> then haſtened away, fearful of
<lb/>being detained; and as the weather was 
<lb/>ſerene, he determined to go on foot, that, if
<lb/>he found all quiet around the apartment of
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, he might glide up for a moment
<lb/>to appriſe her that they might without in­
<lb/>terruption meet in his ſtudy that evening.
<lb/>There was a late moon, and the night pro­
<lb/>miſed to be beautifully clear; he knew
<lb/>therefore that there was little or no hazard
<lb/>of brandy and tea-merchants being abroad:
          <lb/>and as to the hint dropt by <persName>Stockton</persName>,
<lb/>which had at firſt given him ſo much
<lb/>pain, he now fancied it was merely the
<lb/>random folly of a drunkard, and that he
          <lb/>knew nothing of <persName>Monimia</persName> but what he
          <lb/>might have collected from <persName>Philip Somerive</persName>

<lb/>after their firſt unlucky meeting in the 
<lb/>woods.</p>
            <p>Had he now taken his horſe, he muſt of 
<lb/>neceſſity have made his return known to the
<lb/>ſtable-ſervants at the Hall, before he could
          <lb/>have a moment's converſation with <persName>Moni­
<lb/>mia</persName>: he proceeded therefore quickly on
<lb/>foot, meditating as he went on what had
<lb/>juſt paſſed with his father and his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>He had often thought of entruſting <persName>Se­
            <lb/>lina</persName> with the ſecret of his paſſion for <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>. He had often wiſhed they were 
<lb/>known to each other. Equally innocent,
<lb/>amiable, and gentle, with a perfect reſem­
<lb/>blance in temper and in years, he believed
<lb/>that they would fondly love each other;
<lb/>and that if he could ſee them attached to
<lb/>each other, it would be the happieſt cir­
<lb/>cumſtance of his life. He hoped too, that
<lb/>the ſociety and the ſoothing ſweetneſs of 
          <lb/><persName>Selina</persName> would be a reſource of comfort to
          <lb/>his <persName>Monimia</persName> when he was far from her. But
<lb/>how he could bring them together, he had
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">yet</mw>
<pb n="2107"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">107</mw>
          <lb/>yet no idea—<persName>Selina</persName> being never admitted 
          <lb/>but on days of ceremony at <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>;
          <lb/>and <persName>Monimia</persName> being ſo nearly a priſoner,
<lb/>that the unlucky excurſion which occaſion­
<lb/>ed them all ſo much trouble, was almoſt the
<lb/>firſt, and was, in conſequence of her ſtay,
<lb/>which had given ſo much offence, likely to 
<lb/>be the laſt her aunt would allow her to make.
          <lb/>He propoſed, however, to conſult <persName>Moni­
<lb/>mia</persName> upon it, and to conſider whether ſome
<lb/>ſafe means of their meeting could be found.</p>
            <p>Between that gate of the park that lay
          <lb/>towards <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, and the houſe,
<lb/>there were two paths. The upper one was
<lb/>over an eminence where the park paling
<lb/>encloſed part of the down, under which it
<lb/>ſpread a verdant boſom, with coppices and
<lb/>tall woods interſperſed. The other path,
<lb/>which in winter or in wet ſeaſons was in­
<lb/>convenient, wound down a declivity, where
<lb/>the furze and fern were ſhaded by a few old
<lb/>hawthorns and ſelf-ſown firs: out of the
<lb/>hill ſeveral ſtreams were filtered, which
<lb/>uniting at its foot, formed a large and clear
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">F 6</mw>

<pb n="2108"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">108</mw>
<lb/>pond of near twenty acres, fed by ſeveral
<lb/>imperceptible currents from other emi­
<lb/>nences which ſheltered that ſide of the
<lb/>park; and the baſon between the hills and
<lb/>the higher parts of it being thus filled, the
<lb/>water found its way over a ſtony boundary,
<lb/>where it was paſſable by a foot-bridge un­
<lb/>leſs in time of floods; and from thence fell 
<lb/>into a lower part of the ground, where it
<lb/>formed a conſiderable river; and, winding
<lb/>among willows and poplars for near a mile,
<lb/>again ſpread into a ſtill larger lake, on the
<lb/>edge of which was a mill, and oppoſite,
<lb/>without the park paling, wild heaths, where
<lb/>the ground was ſandy, broken, and irregu­
<lb/>lar, ſtill however marked by plantations
          <lb/>made on it by the <name>Rayland family</name>. It
<lb/>was along the lower road, which went 
<lb/>through woods to the edge of what was 
          <lb/>called the upper pond, that <persName>Orlando</persName> took 
<lb/>his way. Juſt as he arrived at the water,
<lb/>from the deep gloom of the tall firs through
<lb/>which he paſſed, the moon appeared be­
<lb/>hind the oppoſite coppices, and threw her

<lb/>long line of trembling radiance on the wa­
<lb/>ter. It was a cold but clear evening, and, 
<lb/>though early in <name>November</name>, the trees were
<lb/>not yet entirely ſtripped of their diſcolour­
<lb/>ed leaves:—a low wind ſounded hollow
<lb/>through the firs and ſtone-pines over his
<lb/>head, and then faintly ſighed among the
<lb/>reeds that crowded into the water: no
<lb/>other ſound was heard, but, at diſtant in­
<lb/>tervals, the cry of the wild fowl concealed
<lb/>among them, or the dull murmur of the
          <lb/>current, which was now low. <persName>Orlando</persName> had
<lb/>hardly ever felt himſelf ſo impreſſed with
<lb/>thoſe feelings which inſpire poetic effuſions:
<lb/>—Nature appeared to pauſe, and to aſk the
<lb/>turbulent and troubled heart of man, whe­
<lb/>ther his ſilly purſuits were worth the toil he
<lb/>undertook for them? Peace and tranquil­
<lb/>lity ſeemed here to have retired to a tran­
          <lb/>ſient abode; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, as ſlowly he
<lb/>traverſed the narrow path over ground made
<lb/>hollow by the roots of theſe old trees, ſtep­
<lb/>ped as lightly as if he feared to diſturb
<lb/>them. Inſenſibly he began to compare this
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſcene,</mw>
<pb n="2110"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">110</mw>
<lb/>ſcene, the ſcenes he every day ſaw of rural
<lb/>beauty and rural content, with thoſe into
<lb/>which his deſtiny was about to lead him—
          <lb/><said>Oh, <persName>Monimia</persName>!</said>, ſighed he, <said>why can­
<lb/>not I remain with thee in this my native
<lb/>country? How happy ſhould I be to be
<lb/>allowed to cultivate one of the ſmalleſt of 
            <lb/>thoſe farms which belong to the <name>Rayland
<lb/>eſtate</name>, and, compriſing in thy ſociety and
<lb/>that of my family all my felicity, have no
<lb/>wiſh but to live and die without reading that
<lb/>great book which they call the World!—
<lb/>Alas! ſhall I ever underſtand its language?
<lb/>ſhall I ever become an adept in the princi­
<lb/>ples it teaches? and ſhall I be happier if I
<lb/>do?—But they tell me, that a young man
<lb/>ſhould not be idle; that he muſt be ſome­
<lb/>thing, a lawyer or a ſoldier; and yet, to
<lb/>aſſiſt men in ruining each other, and ſpoil­
<lb/>ing the ſimple dignity of juſtice, ſeems
<lb/>the buſineſs of the firſt; and to learn the
<lb/>art of deſtroying honourably our fellow­
<lb/>men, the whole concern of the ſecond.—
<lb/>There are, however, other profeſſions, it is

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">111</mw>
<lb/>true—I might be a clergyman, and remain
<lb/>here, with little to do but to ride twenty or
<lb/>thirty miles of a <name>Sunday</name>, to execute, with
<lb/>the hurry of a poſtman, the duties I ſhould
<lb/>have ſworn to fulfil: and can I conſcien­
<lb/>tiouſly do what I ſee done every day?
<lb/>Impoſſible!—I might too be a merchant:
<lb/>but that I have no talents for a profeſſion,
<lb/>honourable as I allow it to be, where the
<lb/>mind is continually chained to the calcula­
<lb/>tion of profit and loſs; and if I am to en­
<lb/>ter into active life, let it be rather in any
<lb/>line than that which ſhall confine my acti­
            <lb/>vity to a compting-houſe—For then, <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>! I muſt equally leave thee, and live
<lb/>among thoſe who value nothing but money,
<lb/>and who would ridicule a paſſion like mine.</said>
<lb/>—He pauſed, and again looked around
          <lb/>him. <said>How beautiful a ſcene!</said> conti­
          <lb/>nued he; <said>I would that <persName>Monimia</persName> were 
<lb/>here to enjoy it!—But never am I allowed
<lb/>to point out to her theſe lovely proſpects,
<lb/>never permitted to cultivate that pure and
<lb/>elegant taſte which ſhe has received from

<lb/>nature; and I am now about to tell her
<lb/>that we are to part, never perhaps to meet
<lb/>more!—Yet the die is caſt: I have promi­
<lb/>ſed—nay, I ought to obey my father—and I 
<lb/>go――</said> A deep and mournful reverie 
<lb/>ſucceeded, as, walking onward, his rapid 
<lb/>imagination deſcribed to him all the ſad
<lb/>poſſibilities that might ariſe between him 
<lb/>and his happineſs. In this deſponding
<lb/>temper, but without meeting any one to
          <lb/>interrupt him in his intended viſit to <persName>Mo­
            <lb/>nimia</persName>, he reached the turret, and ſoftly and
<lb/>ſilently aſcended the ſtair-caſe. He took
          <lb/>the uſual precautions to aſcertain that <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName> was alone; and then, being admitted 
<lb/>for a moment to ſpeak to her, he aſſured 
<lb/>her that ſhe might, without any danger, 
<lb/>venture to his room that evening. He told
<lb/>her he had much to ſay to her—much, on
<lb/>which their future happineſs depended, to
<lb/>offer to her conſideration; and therefore 
<lb/>he beſought her to diveſt herſelf of her
          <lb/>fears, and to oblige him. <persName>Monimia</persName>, con­
<lb/>fiding entirely in him, promiſed to be

          <lb/>ready; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, then going through
<lb/>the ſervants' hall as if he had that moment
          <lb/>arrived from <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, deſired <persName>Bet­
<lb/>ty</persName> to make up his fire and prepare his bed,
<lb/>ſaying, that he was come back to his own
<lb/>apartments, on the arrival of his brother at 
          <lb/>home. He then enquired of <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, if
          <lb/>he thought <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> could be ſpoken
          <lb/>to that evening? <said>I know nothing of the
<lb/>matter,</said> anſwered the old butler in a very
          <lb/>ſullen tone; <said>you may aſk the women-folks,
<lb/>as you're always a-dangling after them.—
<lb/>When I ſaw Madam laſt, ſhe was not in a 
<lb/>way very like to be troubled with company
<lb/>to-night.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, angry and diſguſted by this
<lb/>rudeneſs, now enquired of the cook, who,
<lb/>though ſhe rivalled in perſon and features
          <lb/>the dame <persName>Leonarda of <placeName>Gil Blas</placeName></persName>, was a great
<lb/>admirer of beauty in others, and had al­
          <lb/>ways beheld <persName>Orlando</persName> with partial eyes. <said>Is
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> ill, then, <persName>Martha</persName>?</said> ſaid he.
            <lb/><said>Not that I knows on,</said> replied the wo­
          <lb/>man—<said>Only a few twinges of the gout

<lb/>about her feet, much as ordinary, that makes
<lb/>her, I reckon, a little peeviſh: and I under­
<lb/>ſtood that Madam was a little out of ſorts
<lb/>at hearing nothing of you yeſterday; and
<lb/>they've been a-telling her as how you din­
<lb/>ed out with them there gentlefolk at the
<lb/>Caſtle, as Madam hates worſe than any var­
<lb/>mint.</said></p>
            <p><said>So,</said> thought <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>I am at 
<lb/>length become of conſequence enough to
<lb/>be miſſed if I am longer abſent than uſual!
<lb/>but the officious malice of whoever it was 
<lb/>that related our dinner party yeſterday, has
<lb/>probably ſpoiled my reception.—Can you 
            <lb/>tell me, <persName>Martha</persName>, whether your lady is likely
<lb/>to ſee me to-night, if I ſend up for leave?</said></p>
            <p><said>Lord! I'll anſwer for't,</said> anſwered the
          <lb/>cook; <said>ifackins, I believe Madam, if ſhe
<lb/>was fairly left to herſelf, is always as glad
<lb/>to ſee you as can be—I'll go up now, if you
<lb/>pleaſe, and let her know you be here.</said></p>
            <p>This courteous offer <persName>Orlando</persName> readily ac­
          <lb/>cepted; and in a few moments <persName>Martha</persName> re­
          <lb/>turned. <said>Well, <persName>Martha</persName>, may I go up?</said>

          <lb/>enquired he. <said>Yes, you may,</said> replied
          <lb/><persName>Martha</persName>; <said>but Madam's not in one of her
<lb/>ſugar plum humours, I can tell you.—
<lb/>She've got the gout in her foot, and ſhe've
<lb/>got ſome vagaries in her head about your
<lb/>going to viſit her innimies: you'll have a 
            <lb/>few ſour looks, I doubt—but, Lord! <persName>Maſter
<lb/>Orlando</persName>, you've ſuch a good-looking plea­
<lb/>ſant countenance, that I'll defy the witch of
<lb/><placeName>Endor</placeName> to be anger'd long with you.</said></p>
            <p>Then, thanking his ambaſſadreſs for the
<lb/>trouble ſhe had taken, and being ſome­
<lb/>what encouraged by her opinion of the
<lb/>powers of his countenance, he walked up
<lb/>ſtairs.</p>
            <p>He tapped at the door, as was his cuſ­
<lb/>tom; and was, by the ſhrill ſharp voice of
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, directed to come in. He
<lb/>was ſtruck, on entering the room, by the
          <lb/>ſight of <persName>Monimia</persName>, who ſtood near the fire
<lb/>watching the moment when a ſaucepan, in
          <lb/>which ſome medicine <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was

<lb/>move. Without, however, noticing her,
<lb/>he approached his venerable couſin, in
<lb/>whoſe countenance, which ſeemed to have
<lb/>gained no additional ſweetneſs, he did not
<lb/>read a very favourable anſwer to his enquiry
<lb/>of—how ſhe found herſelf?</p>
            <p><said>No matter how,</said> replied ſhe with ab­
          <lb/>rupt aſperity; <said>if it had been of any con­
<lb/>ſequence to you, you would have aſked 
<lb/>yeſterday, I ſuppoſe.</said></p>

<lb/>never was any declaration more ſincere than

<lb/>at being detained all day from the Hall.</said></p>
            <p><said>Humph!</said> cried <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, <said>your
<lb/>new friends no doubt made you amends.
<lb/>I thought, Sir, you had known that when
            <lb/>people go <emph>there</emph>, I never deſire to ſee them
            <lb/><emph>here</emph>, not I. I wiſh, if you like ſuch acquaint­

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> now began with calmneſs, yet
<lb/>without any thing like ſycophant ſubmiſ­
<lb/>ſion, to account for his father's having been
          <lb/>led by the entreaties of <persName>General Tracy</persName>, to
<lb/>whom he thought himſelf much obliged, to
<lb/>break through a reſolution he had taken
          <lb/>never to viſit at <placeName>Carloraine Caſtle</placeName>:—<said>a re­
            <lb/>ſolution,</said> added <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>that he now
<lb/>heartily wiſhes he had adhered to, as he
<lb/>found the ſociety ſuch as he neither ap­
<lb/>proves for me, or can endure for himſelf.
<lb/>I aſſure you, Madam, he never intends to
<lb/>repeat an experiment, which nothing but
<lb/>his wiſhes to oblige the General made him
<lb/>conſent to now.</said></p>
            <p><said>Well,</said> ſaid <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, a little ap­
          <lb/>peaſed, <said>it is very wonderful to me that
            <lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName>, a man of family, can aſſo­

            <p><said>There is one thing, however, Madam,</said><lb/>anſwered <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>that it does not ſeem

<lb/>Well, ſo it is in trade!—So you think

          <lb/>together two ſuch originals as <persName>Mrs. Ray­
            <lb/>land</persName> and <persName>General Tracy</persName>; and he knew, that
          <lb/>as the latter was a <emph>man of family</emph>, and ſo
<lb/>very polite, he ſhould not riſk their mu­
<lb/>tually diſliking each other by bringing
<lb/>them together; or at leaſt that, if ſuch a
<lb/>circumſtance ſhould happen, thoſe man­
<lb/>ners, which both piqued themſelves on poſ­
<lb/>ſeſſing, would prevent their ſhewing it.—
<lb/>For theſe, and for many other reaſons, he
          <lb/>eagerly ſeized on the hint <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
          <lb/>had dropped. <said>Dear Madam,</said> cried he,
          <lb/><said>I heartily hope you <emph>will</emph> be well enough.
<lb/>The General would be greatly flattered by
<lb/>ſuch a diſtinction! I know that nothing

<lb/>you would permit me to be your meſſenger

            <p><said>Truly, child,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,
<lb/>whoſe anger ſeemed to be quite evaporat­
          <lb/>ed, <said>I am ſo out of the uſe of having

            <p><persName>Lennard</persName>, who loved nothing better than
<lb/>great dinners, in which ſhe was of ſo much

<lb/>quietly ſeated by the fire in the Study; and
<lb/>now that he was once more to enjoy that
<lb/>happineſs, he could not determine to em­
<lb/>bitter it by ſpeaking of the probability
<lb/>there was that he was ſoon to leave her,
<lb/>and enter on a new mode of life. He could,
<lb/>when they were actually together, the leſs
<lb/>reſolve to ſpeak of this, as <persName>Monimia</persName> ap­
<lb/>peared in unuſual ſpirits; and from what
          <lb/>ſhe had obſerved of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> beha­
<lb/>viour to him, in the interview at which
<lb/>ſhe had been preſent, ſhe found reaſon for
<lb/>forming more ſanguine hopes than ſhe had
<lb/>ever yet indulged, that their delicious

<lb/>its preſent poſſeſſor.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of deſtroying theſe
<lb/>flattering viſions, which lent to the lovely
          <lb/>features of <persName>Monimia</persName> the moſt cheerful ani­
<lb/>mation, he endeavoured to diveſt his own
<lb/>mind of the painful reflections it had of
<lb/>late entertained; and inſtead of talking of
          <lb/>what <emph>was</emph> to happen, he wiſhed to fortify
          <lb/>the mind of <persName>Monimia</persName> againſt whatever
          <lb/><emph>might</emph> happen, by giving her a taſte for
<lb/>reading, and cultivating her excellent un­

          <lb/>and gave to <persName>Orlando</persName> exquiſite delight. He
<lb/>had animated the lovely ſtatue, and, like
          <lb/>another <persName>Prometheus</persName>, ſeemed to have drawn
<lb/>his fire from heaven. The ignorance and
          <lb/>the prejudices in which <persName>Monimia</persName> had been

<lb/>celebrated moraliſts. She underſtood, and
<lb/>had peculiar pleaſure in reading, the poets,
          <lb/>which <persName>Orlando</persName> had ſelected for her; and
<lb/>when ſhe repeated, in a faſcinating voice,
<lb/>ſome of the paſſages ſhe particularly ad­
          <lb/>mired, <persName>Orlando</persName> was inſpired with the moſt
<lb/>ardent wiſh to become a poet himſelf.</p>
            <p>Very different was the way in which his 
<lb/>elder brother paſſed this evening. Torment­
<lb/>ed with fear and remorſe, that unfortunate
<lb/>young man had returned to his long-deſert­
<lb/>ed home, for no other reaſon than becauſe 
<lb/>he had, during his northern expedition,
<lb/>loſt to his companions every guinea that he
<lb/>could by any means raiſe, and had beſides
<lb/>contracted with them a very conſiderable 
<lb/>debt of honour. He knew not how to ap­
<lb/>ply to his father, whom he had already im­
<lb/>poveriſhed; yet his pride would not let him
          <lb/>return to <persName>Mr. Stockton's</persName>, whither ſome of
<lb/>the party were again gone, till he had the 
<lb/>means of ſatisfying their demands againſt
<lb/>him. In this emergency he came home, in
<lb/>hopes of finding ſome pretence to procure

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">127</mw>
<lb/>the money of his mother, whom he believ­
<lb/>ed he could perſuade to borrow it for him
          <lb/>of her brother <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>, as ſhe had
<lb/>done a leſs conſiderable ſum once before;
<lb/>or at all events to gain a few days, in which
<lb/>he might conſider what to do.</p>
            <p>It was to the dejection he felt on the 
<lb/>awkward circumſtances to which he had re­
<lb/>duced himſelf, that the gravity and ſteadi­
<lb/>neſs of manner was owing, which his father
<lb/>took for contrition and reformation. It
<lb/>laſted, however, no longer than till the
          <lb/>next evening, when, after tea, <persName>Mrs. Some­
            <lb/>rive</persName>, as uſual, in order to amuſe the Gene­
<lb/>ral, propoſed cards—<persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, how­
<lb/>ever, having a perſon with him upon buſi­
<lb/>neſs from whom he could not diſengage
          <lb/>himſelf, and <persName>Orlando</persName> having returned to
          <lb/><placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName> immediately after dinner,
<lb/>there was not enough to make a whiſt
<lb/>table (as none of the young ladies played),
          <lb/>and therefore young <persName>Somerive</persName> propoſed to
<lb/>the General to ſit down to piquet.</p>

            <p>To this propoſal he of courſe conſented,
<lb/>and, either from chance or deſign, the Ge­
<lb/>neral loſt every party, and had preſently
<lb/>paid to his antagoniſt twelve guineas. Ani­
<lb/>mated by this ſucceſs, eſpecially as it was
<lb/>againſt a man who was known to be in ha­
          <lb/>bits of paying at the firſt clubs, <persName>Philip
<lb/>Somerive</persName> again propoſed playing after 
<lb/>ſupper. Fortune continued to be propi­
<lb/>tious; and when his father, mother and ſiſ­
<lb/>ters retired, at a later hour than ordinary,
<lb/>he ſtill continued at the table, where he was
<lb/>now a winner of about fifty guineas.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner out of his way, than
<lb/>the true ſpirit of gaming, which their pre­
<lb/>ſence had checked, broke out.</p>
            <p><said>This is poor piddling work, General!</said><lb/>exclaimed he: <said>Do you not think hazard
<lb/>a better thing?</said></p>
            <p>The General anſwered coolly, that it cer­
<lb/>tainly was; <said>but,</said> added he, <said>I ſuppoſe 
<lb/>my good hoſt would think his houſe pollut­
<lb/>ed by having the neceſſary inſtruments in

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">129</mw>
<lb/>it. He has no other dice, I dare ſwear,
<lb/>than thoſe in the back-gammon table.</said></p>
            <p><said>Oh! as to that,</said> anſwered young
            <lb/><persName>Somerive</persName>, <said>I am always provided with an
<lb/>apparatus in caſe of emergency—there is
<lb/>no travelling without ſuch a reſource—I
<lb/>have the pretty creatures up ſtairs. What
<lb/>ſay you, General—ſhall we waſte an hour
<lb/>with them?</said></p>
            <p><said>With all my heart,</said> replied <persName>Tracy</persName>. 
          <lb/><said>Let us ſee if you are as much befriended
<lb/>by chance, as you have been by ſkill.</said></p>
            <p>Young <persName>Somerive</persName> now produced from his
<lb/>travelling portmanteau a box and dice: he
<lb/>put a green cloth over the table, that the 
<lb/>rattling of them might not be heard in the
<lb/>houſe; and then telling the ſervants that
<lb/>none need ſit up but the General's ſervant,
<lb/>they began to play, and continued at it till
<lb/>morning broke, with various ſucceſs—But on
          <lb/>quitting it, <persName>Somerive</persName> found himſelf a very
<lb/>conſiderable gainer, and retired to his bed
<lb/>fluſhed with the hope that the General, all
<lb/>veteran as he appeared, and calmly as he

<lb/>played, was a pigeon, from whoſe wings he
<lb/>might pluck the feathers which were want­
<lb/>ing to repair his own.</p>
            <p>The General, who only wanted a ſtudy
<lb/>of his character, and to whom hundreds
<lb/>were as nothing when he had any favourite
<lb/>project in view, was now perfectly aſſured 
<lb/>that, by loſing money to him, or by ſup­
<lb/>plying him with it when he loſt it to others,
<lb/>this young man would become wholly ſub­
<lb/>ſervient to his wiſhes, however contrary to
<lb/>honour or conſcience. He did not diſlike
<lb/>play, though he never regularly purſued it;
<lb/>and had one of thoſe cool heads in ſuch
<lb/>matters, which had prevented his ever ſuf­
<lb/>fering by it. He had generally been a 
<lb/>winner, and particularly in betting:—he
          <lb/>frequented, when he was in <placeName>London</placeName>, all
<lb/>the houſes where high play is carried on;
<lb/>and was ſo much accuſtomed to ſee thou­
<lb/>ſands paid and received at theſe places as 
<lb/>matters of courſe, that he held the trifle he
          <lb/>had paid to <persName>Philip Somerive</persName> the evening
<lb/>before as not worth remembering. It was

<pb n="2131"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">131</mw>
          <lb/>therefore with ſome ſurpriſe that he heard
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, who had called him apart
<lb/>the next morning, expreſs, in very forcible
<lb/>terms, his great concern that his ſon had
<lb/>won ſo large a ſum of him. If the Gene­
          <lb/>ral felt any concern, it was that <persName>Philip</persName>
<lb/>ſhould have been unguarded enough to 
<lb/>ſpeak of it. He ſoon, however, learned
          <lb/>that <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> alluded ſolely to the
<lb/>fifty guineas he had won at piquet, and
<lb/>that of the ſubſequent tranſactions of the
<lb/>evening he knew nothing. This therefore
          <lb/>he carefully concealed, and, aſſuring <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Somerive</persName> that he had almoſt forgot they
<lb/>played at all, conjured him not to be uneaſy
<lb/>about it.</p>
            <p><said>I know, my dear General,</said> ſaid <persName>Some­
            <lb/>rive</persName>, <said>I know perfectly well that this is a
<lb/>mere trifle to you; but to my ſon it may,
<lb/>nay it will have the worſt conſequence.
<lb/>He is, I ſee with an aching heart, too
<lb/>much devoted to play—Succeſs only nou­
<lb/>riſhes this ruinous paſſion—and diſtreſſed

<lb/>as I have been, and indeed am, by his con­
<lb/>duct, I ſhould rather have paid an hundred
<lb/>pounds for him than have ſeen him win
<lb/>fifty.</said></p>
            <p>The General endeavoured to quiet, on
<lb/>this head, the apprehenſions of the unhap­
<lb/>py father, by telling him that he ſaw no­
<lb/>thing in the young man that was not at his 
<lb/>age, and with his proſpects, very excuſable.
          <lb/><said>It is ſurely,</said>  ſaid he, <said>hazardous, my
<lb/>good friend, to check your ſon too much.
<lb/>If home is rendered utterly unpleaſant to
<lb/>him, his volatility ſeeks reſource abroad;
<lb/>and there you know how many deſigning
<lb/>people beſet a young man of his expecta­
<lb/>tions.</said></p>
            <p><said>Good God!</said> exclaimed <persName>Somerive</persName>,
          <lb/><said><emph>what are</emph> his expectations? He has im­
<lb/>preſſed you, I ſee, my dear Sir, with the
<lb/>ſame idea which has in fact undone him, 
<lb/>and will undo us all. What expectations
<lb/>has he that can in the leaſt be relied upon,
<lb/>unleſs it be of this ſmall eſtate, which he is

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">133</mw>
<lb/>already diſmembering, and which will ſoon
<lb/>diſappear—ah! very ſoon indeed, in the
<lb/>hands of a gameſter.</said></p>
            <p><said>Tie it up, then</said>, ſaid the General.</p>
            <p><said>I cannot,</said> anſwered <persName>Somerive</persName>; <said>for it 
<lb/>is entailed, and, except my wife's jointure
<lb/>of an hundred a year, which with difficulty
<lb/>I contrived to ſettle upon her, he may diſſi­
<lb/>pate it all, and I have no doubt but he 
<lb/>will.</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>You judge, I think, too hardly of him.
<lb/>Something is ſurely to be forgiven him,
<lb/>who has always been told that he muſt be
            <lb/>heir to the great property of the <name>Raylands</name>,
<lb/>and poſſeſs one of the largeſt landed eſtates
<lb/>in the county.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>O! would to heaven he never had been
            <lb/>told ſo!</said> ſaid <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> with a deep ſigh.
          <lb/><said>If ever, my dear General, he ſhould talk
<lb/>to you about it, pray endeavour to wean
<lb/>him from expectations ſo ruinous, and, I
<lb/>think, ſo fallacious. It is true that I am
            <lb/>heir at law to all the eſtates of <persName>Sir Orlando

<lb/>Hildebrand's</persName> daughters having iſſue, but not
<lb/>if the ſurvivor of them diſpoſes of it by will,
<lb/>for the whole is hers without any reſtriction;
<lb/>and there is not the leaſt chance of her dy­
            <lb/>ing <emph>without</emph> a will, for I know ſhe is <emph>never</emph>
<lb/>without one: and the people who ſurround
<lb/>her take eſpecial care that her own family
<lb/>ſhall be excluded from it.</said></p>
            <p><said>You do not then ſuppoſe,</said> ſaid the

<lb/>that theſe people, by whom I conclude you

<lb/>heard you ſpeak, have intereſt enough with
<lb/>her to ſecure to themſelves ſo large a pro­
            <lb/>perty as <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> poſſeſſes. I ſhould
<lb/>think it more likely that, though ſhe will
<lb/>probably give them conſiderable legacies,
<lb/>ſhe will leave the eſtate to the next heir;
<lb/>her pride will urge her to this, perhaps, on

            <p><said>I fear, not,</said> anſwered <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>.
          <lb/><said>She has a very ſingular temper, and has

            <lb/>father <persName>Sir Hildebrand</persName> diſgraced herſelf by
<lb/>marrying my father. She has on a thou­
<lb/>ſand occaſions given me to underſtand,
            <lb/>that the ſmall portion of Rayland
<lb/>blood which I have the honour to boaſt,
<lb/>is much debaſed by having mingled with
<lb/>that of a plebeian; and that the blood of

            <lb/>moved from the <name>Raylands</name>, ſhe cannot con­
<lb/>ſider them as belonging to the family,
<lb/>which is in her opinion extinct—She means
<lb/>therefore to perpetuate its remembrance by
<lb/>the only method in which ſhe believes ſhe
<lb/>can do it worthily; and, after giving her
<lb/>ſervants conſiderable legacies――perhaps
            <lb/>ſomething to <persName>Orlando</persName>—to have recourſe to
<lb/>the common refuge of poſthumous pride,
<lb/>and, with her large landed eſtates, to endow
<lb/>an hoſpital, which ſhall be called after her
<lb/>name.</said></p>
            <p>The General exclaimed loudly againſt

          <lb/>but, after hearing on what <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>

<lb/>founded his opinion, he agreed that it 
          <lb/>ſeemed but too probable. <said>And yet,</said>
          <lb/>added he, <said>it appears to be more the intereſt
<lb/>of theſe ſervants, by whom you ſay ſhe is
<lb/>governed, that the eſtate ſhould deſcend to
<lb/>an individual—particularly that of the old
<lb/>houſekeeper, who, from what I can make
<lb/>out of the ſcraps I have picked up here
            <lb/>and there about this <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſeems to
<lb/>have a plan of drawing in your youngeſt 
<lb/>ſon to marry her; and of courſe it muſt be 
            <lb/>her wiſh, that <emph>he</emph> ſhould be <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName>
<lb/>heir.</said></p>
            <p><said>I have not diſcovered,</said> replied <persName>Some­
            <lb/>rive</persName> <said>in all I have collected from <persName>Orlan­
<lb/>do</persName>, that the aunt is at all privy to their 
<lb/>attachment. But that indeed may be her
<lb/>art—She poſſeſſes more than almoſt any
<lb/>woman I ever knew; and had ſhe much leſs,
<lb/>ſhe muſt know that the bare ſuſpicion of
            <lb/>ſuch an intrigue, on the part of <persName>Mrs. Ray­
              <lb/>land</persName>, would occaſion the diſgrace of <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>—the expulſion of the girl from the

<lb/>houſe—and perhaps the ruin of herſelf, if
<lb/>the leaſt idea occured of her being of their
<lb/>counſel.</said></p>
            <p><said>Upon the whole, then, my friend,</said><lb/>cried the General, <said>I think that the put­
            <lb/>ting <persName>Orlando</persName> into ſome profeſſion imme­
<lb/>diately ſeems the only prudent meaſure
<lb/>you can take. This will probably aſcertain
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> intentions, if they are in 
<lb/>his favour; and, if they are not, will re­
<lb/>move him from a ſituation which appears 
<lb/>in my mind a thouſand times more likely 
<lb/>to ruin him for life, then even thoſe impru­
<lb/>dences of which you complain in his bro­
<lb/>ther: for be aſſured, my dear Sir, a young
<lb/>fellow is never ſo completely ruined as
<lb/>when he has married fooliſhly—Every
<lb/>other folly is retrievable; but an engage­
<lb/>ment of that ſort blaſts a man's fortune for
<lb/>ever: and the wiſeſt thing he can do after­
<lb/>wards is to hang himſelf.</said></p>

<lb/>woman whom he married for love, was by
          <lb/>no means of <persName>Tracy's</persName> opinion as to marriages
<lb/>of affection in general, he ſaw the variety of
          <lb/>evils ſuch a marriage would bring on <persName>Orlan­
<lb/>do</persName>, in as ſtrong a light as his friend could
<lb/>repreſent them. He therefore entirely ac­
<lb/>quieſced in the neceſſity of his being remov­
          <lb/>ed from <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>; and waited with im­
          <lb/>patience for <persName>Orlando's</persName> account of what had
<lb/>paſſed in that conference which he had un­
<lb/>dertaken to hold with the old lady, on the
<lb/>ſubject of his entering the army.</p>
            <p>Juſt as he parted from <persName>General Tracy</persName>,
<lb/>who about an hour and a half before din­
          <lb/>ner retired to his toilet, <persName>Orlando</persName> appeared
<lb/>on horſeback. His father met him; and 
<lb/>bidding him join him in the garden as
<lb/>ſoon as he had put his horſe in the ſtable,
          <lb/>he walked thither—<persName>Orlando</persName> in a moment
          <lb/>attended him. <said>Well,</said> ſaid <persName>Mr. Some­
            <lb/>rive</persName> gravely, <said>have you had an opportu­
<lb/>nity of converſing with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> on

<lb/>removed from your preſent ſituation, un­
<lb/>leſs, what is not to be expected, ſhe ſigni­
<lb/>fies her poſitive reſolution to make you
<lb/>very ample amends for your loſs of time,
<lb/>and gives me aſſurances of it.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, in this peremptory determina­
<lb/>tion of his father, fancied he ſaw the machi­
<lb/>nations of his brother to get him away from
<lb/>the Hall; but, without expreſſing any part
<lb/>of the pain ſuch a ſuſpicion gave him, he 
          <lb/>anſwered, <said>You know, my dear Sir, that
<lb/>in our laſt conference on this ſubject, I aſ­
<lb/>ſured you of what I now deſire to repeat,
<lb/>that I live only to obey you: but I have
            <lb/>had no opportunity of ſpeaking to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName> on this ſubject; for, when I ſaw
<lb/>her on the firſt evening of my return to
<lb/>the Hall, it was with great difficulty I 
<lb/>could appeaſe the anger ſhe felt at our hav­
            <lb/>ing dined with <persName>Stockton</persName>.</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>She knew it then?</said>
            </p>
            <p>
              <said>Oh, yes!――<persName>Lennard</persName> and <persName>Pattenſon</persName>

<lb/>At length, however, I had the good for­
<lb/>tune, not only to obtain a remiſſion of my
<lb/>offence, but to engage her to invite our
<lb/>family and the General to dine at her table
<lb/>on <name>Thurſday</name>, when the tenants' feaſt is to
            <lb/>be held at the Hall. <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> piques 
<lb/>herſelf on ſhewing the General, whom ſhe
<lb/>reſpects as a man of family, a ſpecimen of
<lb/>old Engliſh hoſpitality, in oppoſition to the
<lb/>modern profuſion of the Caſtle—and her
<lb/>deſire to obtain his ſuffrage in favour of
            <lb/>the ancient mode of living at <placeName>Rayland
<lb/>Hall</placeName>, has performed what no other conſi­
<lb/>deration would have effected. This unex­
<lb/>pected project entered her head the mo­
<lb/>ment I had deſcribed our viſit; and all
<lb/>yeſterday was paſſed in conſidering about 
            <lb/>it, and debating with <persName>Lennard</persName> whether ſhe
<lb/>ſhould be well enough. To-day it is de­
<lb/>cided that ſhe ſhall, and I am ſent with the
<lb/>invitation, which certainly you and my
<lb/>mother and ſiſters will accept; and I ſup­

<lb/>rage the flattering impreſſions which the

<lb/>and which he had himſelf taught her to
<lb/>cheriſh when they were apparently much

<lb/>when they met this evening, renewed, what
<lb/>he had ſometimes diſtantly touched upon
<lb/>before, the probability that he muſt ſoon
<lb/>enter the army, and quit, at leaſt for a time,
<lb/>the ſpot which, while ſhe remained on it,
<lb/>contained all that gave value to his life.
          <lb/>The tender, timid <persName>Monimia</persName>, in whoſe idea

            <lb/>make us reaſonably <emph>wiſh</emph> to continue it?
<lb/>When we meet, is it not always in fear and 
<lb/>apprehenſion? and are we not ever liable
<lb/>to the ſame alarm as that from which you
<lb/>ſuffered ſo cruelly three weeks ſince?—
<lb/>Alas! even now we are in the power of an
<lb/>unprincipled ruffian, who, though he ap­
<lb/>peared willing to engage for mutual ſecre­
<lb/>cy, may, in a fit of drunkenneſs, betray us;
<lb/>or, through mere inſolence, tell—becauſe
<lb/>he has the power of telling. He did not

            <lb/>does <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, that ſomebody was with
<lb/>me; and the very jealouſy that miſleads

            <p>Theſe reaſonable arguments, joined to

<lb/>ſelf eaſy, and learn to think if his deſtina­
<lb/>tion rather as a matter of ſatisfaction than
          <lb/>apprehenſion. <persName>Monimia</persName> promiſed all he
<lb/>deſired: but ſhe was no ſooner alone than
<lb/>her apprehenſions again returned, and the
<lb/>ſad poſſibilities that ſhe had before enume­
<lb/>rated recurred in all their terrors to her
<lb/>imagination. To theſe many were added,
          <lb/>of which ſhe dared not ſpeak to <persName>Orlando</persName>:
<lb/>the fears that he might forget her; and

            <p><said>That is what you generally are about,
            <lb/>I think,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> harſhly.
          <lb/><said>But I ſuppoſe you have been ſitting
<lb/>up after ſome nonſenſe or other—with your 
<lb/>books or your writing. I ſhall put an end

<lb/>books for you out of the Study, though I
<lb/>have time after time forbidden her to do
<lb/>any ſuch thing.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Monimia</persName>, willing to let it be thought 
          <lb/>that <persName>Betty</persName> did do ſo, rather than excite any
<lb/>other ſuſpicion by denying it, only ſaid
          <lb/>mildly—<said>I hope, dear aunt, there is no
<lb/>harm in my trying to improve myſelf, if I
<lb/>do not therefore neglect what you order
<lb/>me to do?</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>Improve yourſelf!—Yes, truly, a pretty
<lb/>improvement—Your chalky face and pad­
<lb/>ded eyes are mighty improvements: and
<lb/>I'd be glad to know what good your read­
<lb/>ing does you, but to give you a hankering
<lb/>after what you've no right to expect? An
<lb/>improved lady will be above helping me, I

<lb/>you to forbid my reading; but, till then,

<lb/>obtain a little common inſtruction.</said></p>
            <p><said>Don't be impertinent,</said> exclaimed <persName>Mrs.

            <lb/>Lennard</persName>; <said>don't be inſolent—for if
<lb/>you are, Miſs, this houſe is no place for
<lb/>you.—I ſee already the bleſſed effects of
<lb/>your reading—you fancy yourſelf a perſon
<lb/>of conſequence: but I ſhall take care to
            <lb/>put an end to it; for, if <persName>Betty</persName> ſupplies you
<lb/>with candles, I'll diſcharge her.</said></p>
            <p><said>She has <emph>not</emph> indeed, my dear aunt,</said><lb/>ſaid <persName>Monimia</persName>, whoſe generous mind could 
<lb/>not bear that another ſhould ſuffer for

            <p><said>She has not!—what has ſhe not?</said> en­
          <lb/>quired <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>.</p>
            <p><said>She has not lately ſupplied me with 
            <lb/>candles,</said> replied <persName>Monimia</persName>.</p>
            <p><said>How is it, then,</said> cried <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>,
<lb/>fixing on her a ſtern and enquiring eye,
          <lb/><said>that light is ſometimes, aye and very
<lb/>lately too, ſeen from your window, at hours
<lb/>when your own candle is taken away, and
<lb/>when you ought to be in bed?</said></p>
            <p>To this <persName>Monimia</persName> could anſwer nothing,
<lb/>but that it was true ſhe had now and then
<lb/>ſaved a piece of wax candle herſelf; but,

<lb/>in order to put an end to an enquiry
<lb/>which had already made her tremble with
<lb/>the moſt cruel apprehenſions, ſhe endea­
          <lb/>voured leſs to account for what <emph>had</emph> hap­
<lb/>pened, and which ſhe could not deny,
<lb/>than to appeaſe her aunt by very earneſt
<lb/>aſſurances that what offended her ſhould 
<lb/>happen no more, and that, ſince ſhe ſo much
<lb/>diſliked her reading of a night, ſhe would
<lb/>never again practiſe it.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> ſeemed to be ſomewhat
<lb/>ſatisfied by theſe proteſtations—though,
          <lb/>while <persName>Monimia</persName> was with many tears re­
<lb/>peating them, her fierce eyes were fixed on
<lb/>the countenance of her trembling niece
<lb/>with a look of queſtioning doubt, which
          <lb/>made <persName>Monimia</persName> ſhrink with dread—for it
<lb/>ſeemed to intimate that more was ſuſ­
<lb/>pected than was expreſſed.</p>
            <p>At length, however, ſhe condeſcended
          <lb/>to appear pacified; and ſummoning <persName>Betty</persName>
<lb/>and another of the maid-ſervants, ſhe gave
<lb/>them their employments in preparing for
          <lb/>the next day's dinner: then ordering <persName>Mo­
          <lb/>nimia</persName> to take her ſhare, and the ſuperin­

<lb/>tendence of the whole, ſhe returned to
          <lb/>the parlour; and poor <persName>Monimia</persName>, glad to
<lb/>be relieved from her preſence, proceeded
<lb/>as cheerfully in her taſk as her melancholy
          <lb/>reflections on what had paſſed with <persName>Orlan­
<lb/>do</persName> the preceeding night, and her newly-
<lb/>awakened dread of her aunt's ſuſpicions,
<lb/>would allow her to do.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> was much at a loſs to 
<lb/>know how to act in regard to his eldeſt 
<lb/>ſon: fondly flattering himſelf that this be­
<lb/>loved ſon had ſeen the dangerous errors of 
<lb/>his former conduct, he could not bear the 
<lb/>idea of ſhewing any reſentment at what was
<lb/>paſſed, or that, by his being left out of the
          <lb/>party going to <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>, he ſhould be
<lb/>conſidered as an exile from the favour of
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; yet, to let him go without
<lb/>an invitation, he knew, would give of­
<lb/>fence, and he knew not how to ſet about
          <lb/>obtaining one. <persName>Orlando</persName>, who paſſed a few
<lb/>moments with him in the courſe of the pre­
<lb/>ceding <name>Wedneſday</name>, ſaw his father's un­
<lb/>eaſineſs, becauſe he had felt ſomething of
<lb/>the ſame kind himſelf about his brother;

<pb n="2155"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">155</mw>
<lb/>and he generouſly, though without making
<lb/>any merit of it, undertook to remove this
          <lb/>ſource of vexation, by engaging <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName> to invite him. This was an arduous
<lb/>taſk, as the old Lady had not ſeen him
<lb/>for more than two years, and during that
<lb/>time had heard only evil reports of his
<lb/>conduct. The offence he had given her
          <lb/>by aſſociating with the <persName>Stockton</persName> ſet, and
<lb/>even joining in thoſe treſpaſſes of which
<lb/>ſhe believed ſhe had ſo much reaſon to
<lb/>complain, had embittered her mind againſt 
<lb/>him, even more than his gaieties and ex­
          <lb/>travagance:—yet <persName>Orlando</persName>, by aſſuring
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> that he was now ſenſible of
<lb/>his error, that he was come home with a re­
<lb/>ſolution to remain with his family, and that
<lb/>it would diſcourage him in the career of
<lb/>reformation if ſhe did not ſeem ready to
<lb/>forgive, and again conſider him as a part
<lb/>of it, ſo flattered her ſelf-conſequence, and
<lb/>ſoothed her reſentment, that ſhe agreed to
          <lb/>receive <persName>Philip</persName> as one of her gueſts, and
          <lb/>commiſſioned <persName>Orlando</persName> to carry an invitation

<lb/>to his brother: nor could ſhe, with all her
<lb/>natural ſeverity of temper, and little ſenſi­
<lb/>bility to great or generous actions, help be­
<lb/>ing affected by the noble diſintereſtedneſs of
<lb/>her young favourite, who thus laboured to
<lb/>reconcile to her a brother who would
<lb/>have been conſidered by moſt young men
<lb/>as a formidable rival in her favour, and
<lb/>have been aſſiduouſly kept at the diſtance
<lb/>to which he had thrown himſelf. This ex­
<lb/>alted goodneſs of heart ſhe put down im­
<lb/>mediately to the account of the Rayland
          <lb/>blood; and in praiſing <persName>Orlando</persName> to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName>, to whom ſhe now often ſpoke of
<lb/>him with pleaſure, ſhe remarked, that he
<lb/>every day became more and more like the
          <lb/><name>Rayland family</name>—<said>What fine eyes the 
            <lb/>young man has!</said> cried ſhe; <said>and how
<lb/>they flaſhed fire when he was pleading for
<lb/>that ſad brother of his with ſo much ear­
<lb/>neſtneſs!—And then when I ſeemed willing
<lb/>to oblige him, what a fine countenance! I
<lb/>could almoſt have fancied it was my grand­
<lb/>father's picture walked out of its frame,

<lb/>if it had not been for the difference of 
<lb/>dreſs!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> aſſented, and encouraged
<lb/>every favourable idea her Miſtreſs enter­
          <lb/>tained of <persName>Orlando</persName>; but all this while a mine
<lb/>was proceeding againſt him, of which the
<lb/>ſucceſs would inevitably ruin all his hopes.</p>
            <p>This originated in the jealouſy of <persName>Pat­
<lb/>tenſon</persName>, who, whatever favour he obtained
<lb/>by dint of preſents and money from his 
<lb/>coquettiſh dulcinea, could never diveſt him­
          <lb/>ſelf of his apprehenſions that <persName>Orlando</persName> was
<lb/>a ſucceſsful rival. This cruel fear had
<lb/>taken poſſeſſion of his mind long before
          <lb/>the diſcovery of <persName>Jonas Wilkins</persName>; and
<lb/>notwithſtanding the girl's ſolemn proteſta­
<lb/>tions that ſhe was in her own bed at the
          <lb/>time ſhe was accuſed of being with <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> in his Study, and the offers of the 
<lb/>woman who lived in the ſame room to
          <lb/>confirm this by her <emph>Bible oath</emph>, <persName>Pattenſon</persName>
<lb/>could never be perſuaded but that it was
          <lb/><persName>Betty</persName> herſelf; becauſe, having not the
          <lb/>ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of <persName>Monimia</persName>, who was,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">he</mw>
<pb n="2158"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">158</mw>
<lb/>he knew, locked in by her aunt every
<lb/>night, he believed that it was impoſſible
          <lb/>it could be any other perſon. <persName>Betty</persName>, in
<lb/>order to teaſe him, ſometimes affected to
<lb/>be conſcious that the accuſation was true,
          <lb/>while ſhe perſiſted in denying it; and <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> rather encouraged than repreſſed a
<lb/>notion that prevented any conjectures
          <lb/>which might have glanced towards <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia.</persName></p>
            <p>For three weeks, therefore, this uneaſy
<lb/>ſuſpicion had corroded the boſom of the
          <lb/>amorous though venerable <persName>Mr. Patten­
<lb/>ſon</persName>, who, greatly as he loved his eaſe, re­
<lb/>ſigned it to the gratification of his re­
<lb/>venge; and who determined to detect
          <lb/><persName>Betty</persName>, and in doing ſo thought he ſhould 
          <lb/>have an opportunity of ruining <persName>Orlando</persName> 
<lb/>with his Lady, and thus getting out of his
<lb/>way a rival who might one day be his
<lb/>Maſter; and whom he hated, not only on
<lb/>account of his love, but of his intereſt; for
<lb/>ſo highly had he been in favour with all
<lb/>the three ladies, that each had, in dying,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">given</mw>
<pb n="2159"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">159</mw>
<lb/>given him a very conſiderable legacy, and
<lb/>recommended him to the ſurvivor; and he
<lb/>did not doubt but that, on the deceaſe of
<lb/>his preſent Miſtreſs, he ſhould find his pro­
<lb/>perty inferior to that of few gentlemen in
<lb/>the county.</p>
            <p>The gradual increaſe, therefore, of the
<lb/>favour ſhewn to Orlando did not at all 
<lb/>pleaſe him; but his attempts to injure him
          <lb/>with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had never ſucceeded,
<lb/>and began to be diſpleaſing to her. Still,
          <lb/>however, he knew that, if <persName>Orlando</persName> were
<lb/>detected of an intrigue with one of her
<lb/>women-ſervants, it was an offence which
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> would never pardon; and
<lb/>though this diſcovery would certainly occa­
          <lb/>ſion the diſcharge of the fair <persName>Helen</persName> for
          <lb/>whom he ſighed, <persName>Pattenſon</persName> knew that <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> could not take her into his protec­
<lb/>tion for want of money; while, being diſ­
<lb/>miſſed without a character by the two in­
          <lb/>exorable veſtals, his Lady and her com­
<lb/>panion, the girl would be glad to make
<lb/>terms with him; and he was quite rich
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">enough</mw>
<pb n="2160"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">160</mw>
<lb/>enough to undertake to keep her in ſome
<lb/>of the neighbouring towns, till ſhe might 
<lb/>be ſupplanted by ſome newer object.</p>
            <p>Such were the ſpeculations of the poli­
          <lb/>tic <persName>Pattenſon</persName>; but, like many other politi­
<lb/>cians, he purſued, among the many crooked
<lb/>paths before him, that which led him from
          <lb/>his purpoſe. Inſtead of watching <persName>Orlando</persName>,
          <lb/>he ſet himſelf to watch <persName>Betty</persName>, who never
<lb/>went in even with a meſſage to him in his
          <lb/>Study without <persName>Pattenſon</persName> following her;
<lb/>and on the night he engaged her to ſit up
<lb/>for him, the butler was concealed in a 
<lb/>cloſet within the ſervants' hall, and heard
<lb/>all their converſation; and though what
<lb/>then paſſed tended directly to prove to
          <lb/><persName>Pattenſon</persName> that he was in an error, he per­
<lb/>ſuaded himſelf that they ſuſpected his con­
<lb/>cealment, and had agreed upon what they
<lb/>ſhould ſay to miſlead him.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of rejoicing to find
<lb/>his ſuſpicions were not confirmed, he was
<lb/>only irritated to find that his attempts to
<lb/>detect the ſuppoſed lovers were baffled;
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">and</mw>
<pb n="2161"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">161</mw>
<lb/>and he redoubled his vigilance in watching
          <lb/><persName>Betty</persName>, and engaged one of the footmen in
<lb/>the ſame office. This was the ſame man
          <lb/>who had ſeen <persName>Orlando</persName> croſs the park one
<lb/>morning at a very early and unuſual hour,
<lb/>and who then taking him at a diſtance for
<lb/>a poacher, had purſued and ſtopped him;
<lb/>circumſtances which the fellow, who was
          <lb/>the mere creature of <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, had after­
<lb/>wards related to him, with conjectures as
          <lb/>to the reaſon of <persName>Orlando's</persName> appearance that
<lb/>had helped to raiſe higher thoſe ſuſpicions
          <lb/><persName>Pattenſon</persName> had before entertained.</p>
            <p>That <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had determined to
<lb/>have company at her own table, and par­
          <lb/>ticularly the family of <name>Somerive</name>, on the
<lb/>day of the tenants' feaſt, was a terrible vex­
<lb/>ation to Pattenſon—who, inſtead of pre­
<lb/>ſiding like the maſter of the houſe in the
<lb/>hall, would now be only the butler at the
<lb/>ſide-board in the great dining-room; and
<lb/>to chagrin for the conſequence he thus
<lb/>loſt, was added the mortification of knowing
<lb/>that while he ſhould be buſied in attending

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">162</mw>
          <lb/>on his Lady up ſtairs, <persName>Orlando</persName>, who on
<lb/>theſe occaſions, which happened twice a 
<lb/>year, always mingled with the young far­
          <lb/>mers, would have all the <emph>ladies</emph> of the hall 
<lb/>to himſelf.</p>
            <p>It had been the cuſtom of the Hall, time
<lb/>immemorial, for the landlord, on receiving
<lb/>his <name>Michaelmas</name> rents, to give the moſt
<lb/>numerouſly-attended entertainment of the
<lb/>year, and to allow the tenants' ſons and
<lb/>daughters, their friends, and the ſervants of
<lb/>the family, to have a fiddle in the hall. The
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Raylands</persName>, notwithſtanding the ſtate
<lb/>in which they had been educated, had
<lb/>been always, during their youth, led to the
<lb/>company by their father, and accompa­
          <lb/>nied by <persName>Lady Rayland</persName>, and had each gone 
<lb/>down one dance with ſome neighbour­
<lb/>ing gentleman who was invited on pur­
<lb/>poſe, or with the chaplain of the family.
<lb/>Thoſe days, though long ſince paſt, with
<lb/>almoſt all the witneſſes of their feſtivity,
          <lb/>were ſtill recollected by <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> with
<lb/>ſome degree of pleaſure; and as ſhe ad­
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">hered</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="H10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">163</mw>
<lb/>hered moſt ſcrupulouſly to old cuſtoms,
<lb/>however unlike her uſual mode of life, this
<lb/>ſort of ruſtic ball given to the tenants had
<lb/>always been kept up, except in thoſe two
<lb/>years that were marked by the death of
          <lb/>two of the ladies. <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> and <persName>Mr. 
<lb/>Pattenſon</persName>, who had long preſided at them,
<lb/>loved the gaiety of the ſcene, and the con­
<lb/>ſequence they had in it, as they were con­
<lb/>ſidered as the maſter and miſtreſs of the 
          <lb/>feaſt; for, though <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> once uſed
<lb/>to go down to honour it with her preſence 
<lb/>for ten minutes, ſhe had now left off that 
<lb/>cuſtom, from age and infirmity; and her
<lb/>ſervants, to whom it was attended with
<lb/>ſome trouble and loſs of time, had per­
<lb/>ſuaded her that ſhe was always ill after
<lb/>ſuch an exertion. It was, therefore, uſual
<lb/>with her to ſup on this anniverſary ſome­
<lb/>what earlier than ordinary, and to go to
          <lb/>her bed, diſmiſſing <persName>Lennard</persName> to her poſt of
<lb/>miſtreſs of the revel, with a ſtrict charge
<lb/>to her to watch aſſiduouſly againſt the in­
<lb/>truſion of drunkenneſs or impropriety; to

<lb/>ſee that all the gueſts withdrew in due ſea­
<lb/>ſon, and quite ſober; and to ſettle every
<lb/>thing after their departure for the decorum
<lb/>and tranquillity of the next day.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had in general adhered 
<lb/>to theſe good rules, though ſhe thought
<lb/>herſelf at liberty a little to vary from them
<lb/>in the detail. Thus ſhe deemed it no breach
<lb/>of the regularity her Lady recommended,
<lb/>if ſhe acceded to the earneſt ſolicitations of
<lb/>a handſome young farmer, who, as ſhe
<lb/>was perſuaded, left the buxom damſel his
<lb/>partner, purely for the gratification of go­
<lb/>ing down a dance with her; though it
<lb/>ſometimes happened that her intereſt in the
<lb/>renewal of a leaſe, of ſome building want­
<lb/>ing on the farm, for which ſhe could ef­
<lb/>fectually intercede, were more powerful
<lb/>motives than even the honour or the plea­
          <lb/>ſure thus obtained—notwithſtanding <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard's</persName> aſſertion, which was probably
<lb/>true, that ſhe had learned to dance of the
          <lb/>dancing-maſter who taught the firſt <persName>Duke
            <lb/>of Cumberland</persName> and <emph>all</emph> the Princeſſes, and

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">165</mw>
<lb/>that ſhe was celebrated for her excellence
<lb/>in that accompliſhment, particularly her
<lb/>great agility in the rigadoon.</p>
            <p>This rigadoon, like all early and pleaſing
<lb/>acquirements, was ſtill recollected with gra­
<lb/>titude for the fame it had obtained for her;
<lb/>and notwithſtanding the lapſe of years,
<lb/>and ſome rheumatic complaints, ſhe could
<lb/>occaſionally introduce ſome of its original
<lb/>graces into her country-dance. It is true
<lb/>ſhe never performed above one or two at
          <lb/>moſt; but what ſhe <emph>did</emph>, ſhe piqued herſelf
<lb/>upon executing with a degree of ſpirit,
<lb/>which made all the operators in cotillon
          <lb/>ſteps, and allemands, <said>hide their diminiſh­

<lb/>months before, and the cruel and cowardly
<lb/>attack of the rheumatiſm on the limb while
<lb/>it was in a diſabled ſtate, had put an end to
<lb/>the exhibition of this rigadoon ſtep for
<lb/>ever. Yet, with the true ſpirit of perſeve­

<lb/>no more, loved to overlook the dancers,

<lb/>tenſon had to diſlike the party propoſed,
<lb/>had with all her intereſt promoted it—feel­
<lb/>ing, probably, that the pleaſure ſhe re­
          <lb/>ſigned in the country-dance <said>with her
<lb/>rigadoon ſtep,</said> would be amply made up
<lb/>to her in her appearing no longer as only
<lb/>houſe-keeper and attendant, but in the
<lb/>capacity of a companion and friend to
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; for, now her Lady was ſo
<lb/>infirm, ſhe was introduced in that character
<lb/>whatever company might be in the houſe.
<lb/>Far as ſhe was advanced in years, to adorn
<lb/>her perſon was her foible; and ſhe reflect­
<lb/>ed with ſome pleaſure on the ſmart and
<lb/>well-fancied dreſs with which ſhe intended,
<lb/>on this important <name>Thurſday</name>, to aſtoniſh
          <lb/>and outſhine the <name>Somerive family</name>. Of this
          <lb/>vanity, however, poor <persName>Monimia</persName> was the
<lb/>victim; for, after many debates about what
          <lb/>ſhe ſhould wear, <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> found ſome­
<lb/>thing to do to every article of her dreſs.
          <lb/>Theſe alterations were entruſted to <persName>Moni­
            <lb/>mia</persName>; and at night when <persName>Orlando</persName> ſought her,

<lb/>hour with her in her own room, he found
<lb/>her not only indulged with candles, which
<lb/>had been the night before prohibited, but
<lb/>weeping over a taſk which ſhe doubted
<lb/>whether it would be poſſible for her to finiſh
<lb/>in the time aſſigned her, to her aunt's ſatiſ­
<lb/>faction.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> had a particular intereſt in her
<lb/>appearing to advantage the next day; for,
<lb/>though he knew ſhe would not be allowed,
<lb/>nor did he wiſh her to be ſeen among
<lb/>the gueſts, he had imagined a project to
          <lb/>introduce her and his ſiſter <persName>Selina</persName> to each 
<lb/>other while every other perſon was en­
<lb/>gaged. The more he reflected on this 
<lb/>ſcheme, the more practicable it appeared,
<lb/>and the more it flattered his imagination.
<lb/>He, therefore, could not bear to think that,
<lb/>between fatigue and fretting, the beauty he
          <lb/>had ſaid ſo much of to <persName>Selina</persName> ſhould not
          <lb/>be ſeen in all its brilliancy. <said>You ſhall

<lb/>ſoon as it glimmered through her caſement,

<lb/>the other orders of her aunt.</p>
            <p>The whole houſe was in a buſtle—and
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> not only in unuſual health,
<lb/>but as anxious for the ſplendour and ex­

          <lb/>her, and next to <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, ſat the
<lb/>Doctor himſelf, a dignified clergyman, of
<lb/>profound erudition, very ſevere morals, 
<lb/>and very formal manners; who was the
<lb/>moſt orthodox of men, never ſpoke but in
<lb/>ſentences equally learned and indiſputa­
<lb/>ble, and held almoſt all the reſt of the
<lb/>world in as low eſtimation as he conſidered
<lb/>highly his own family, and above all him­
<lb/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Between her mother and <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>,
<lb/>on the other ſide, was placed their only
            <lb/>daughter and heireſs, <persName>Miſs Ann-Jane-Eliza

<lb/>father and her mother, was the pride and

<lb/>each of their perſonal perfections, ſhe was
<lb/>conſidered by them a model of lovelineſs;
<lb/>and her mind was adorned with all that
<lb/>money could purchaſe. The wainſcot
<lb/>complexion of her Mamma was ſet off by
<lb/>the yellow eyebrows and hair of the Doc­
<lb/>tor. His little pug noſe, diveſted of its

          <lb/>of his daughter, was pronounced to be <foreign xml:lang="fr">le
<lb/>petit nez retrouſſé</foreign>, united with the thin lips
<lb/>drawn up to make a little mouth, which
          <lb/>were particular to <said>his better half,</said> as he 
<lb/>facetiouſly called his wife. The worthy
<lb/>archdeacon's ſhort legs detracted leſs from
<lb/>the height of his amiable daughter, as ſhe
<lb/>had the long waiſt of her mother, fine
<lb/>ſugar-loaf ſhoulders that were pronounced
          <lb/>to be <emph>extremely genteel</emph>, and a head which
<lb/>looked as if the back of it had by ſome
<lb/>accident been flattened, ſince it formed a
<lb/>perpendicular line with her back. To dig­
<lb/>nify with mental acquirements this epitome
<lb/>of human lovelineſs, all that education
<lb/>could do had been laviſhed; maſters for
<lb/>drawing, painting, muſic, French, and
<lb/>dancing, had been aſſmbeled around her as
<lb/>ſoon as ſhe could ſpeak; ſhe learned <name>Latin</name>
<lb/>from her father at a very early period,
<lb/>and could read any eaſy ſentence in
<lb/><name>Greek</name>; was learned in aſtronomy, knew
<lb/>ſomething of the mathematics, and, in relief
<lb/>of theſe more abſtruſe ſtudies, read <name>Italian</name>

<lb/>and <name>Spaniſh</name>. Having never heard any 
<lb/>thing but her own praiſes, ſhe really be­
<lb/>lieved herſelf a miracle of knowledge and
<lb/>accompliſhments; and it muſt be owned, 
<lb/>that an audience leſs partial than thoſe be­
<lb/>fore whom ſhe generally performed, might
<lb/>have allowed that ſhe performed very
<lb/>long concertos, and ſolos without end,
<lb/>with infinite correctneſs, and much execu­
<lb/>tion. Then ſhe made moſt inveterate like­
<lb/>neſſes of many of her acquaintance; and
<lb/>painted landſcapes, where very green trees
<lb/>were reflected in very blue water. Her
<lb/><name>French</name> was moſt grammatically correct,
<lb/>though the accent was ſomewhat defective; 
<lb/>and ſhe knew all manner of hiſtory—could
<lb/>tell the dates of the moſt execrable actions
<lb/>of the moſt execrable of human beings—and
<lb/>never had occaſion to conſult, ſo happy
          <lb/>was her memory, <title ref="b:IT03724">Truſler's Chronology</title>.
<lb/>As it was believed, ſo it was aſſerted by the
<lb/>Doctor and his wife, that their daughter
<lb/>was the moſt accompliſhed woman of her
<lb/>age and country; and by moſt of their ac­

<lb/>quaintance it was taken for granted. The
<lb/>gentlemen, however, whom all theſe ele­
<lb/>gancies were probably deſigned to attract,
<lb/>ſeemed by no means ſtruck with them:
<lb/>ſome of them, who had approached her on
<lb/>the ſuggeſtion of her being an heireſs, had
<lb/>declared that her fortune made no amends
<lb/>for her want of beauty; and others had
<lb/>been alarmed by the acquiſitions which
<lb/>went ſo much beyond thoſe they had 
<lb/>made themſelves. Thus, at ſix-and-twenty
<lb/>(though the lady and her parents, for
<lb/>ſome reaſons of their own, called her no
          <lb/>more than twenty-two), <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>
<lb/>was yet unmarried! for, of thoſe lovers
<lb/>who had offered, ſome had been rejected
<lb/>by the Doctor, and ſome by herſelf. She
<lb/>affected a great indifference, and talked of
<lb/>the pleaſures of purſuing knowledge in an
<lb/>elegant retirement. But it was obſerved,
<lb/>that whenever any young men of preſent 
<lb/>fortune, or of future expectation, were in
          <lb/>the country, <persName>Dr. Hollybourn's</persName> family re­
<lb/>turned the viſits of the ladies to whom
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">theſe</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="I5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">177</mw>
<lb/>theſe gentlemen belonged, with unuſual
<lb/>punctuality.</p>
            <p>While they were in this part of the
<lb/>world, they always dined once or twice at 
          <lb/><placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>, where the Doctor was well
<lb/>received as a moſt pious worthy man, his
<lb/>Lady a very good kind of woman, and
<lb/>Miſs as a mighty pretty ſort of a young 
<lb/>perſon. Of late the whole family had
<lb/>riſen into higher favour; for the Doctor
<lb/>was the only clergyman in the country
<lb/>around who had reſiſted the good enter­
          <lb/>tainment ſo profuſely given at <placeName>Carloraine
<lb/>Caſtle</placeName>, and had refuſed to viſit a man who
<lb/>kept a miſtreſs. He had even gone far­
<lb/>ther, and preached a ſermon which all his
<lb/>congregation ſaid pointed immediately at
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Stockton</persName>; but as <persName>Mr. Stockton</persName> did
<lb/>not hear it, and having heard it would 
<lb/>not have cared for it, the reproof only edi­
<lb/>fied his hearers, and raiſed the Doctor in
<lb/>the eſteem of the Lady of the Hall.</p>
            <p>The lower part of the table was filled 
          <lb/>by the four <persName>Miſs Somerives</persName> and their two
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">I 5</mw>

          <lb/>brothers; <persName>Orlando</persName>, at the requeſt of <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, taking his ſeat at the bottom.</p>
            <p>The plenty and excellence of the table,
<lb/>which was furniſhed almoſt entirely from
<lb/>the park, farm, warren, gardens, and ponds
          <lb/>of <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>, were highly commended
<lb/>by the gueſts, and by none with more zeal
<lb/>than the General and the Doctor, who vied
<lb/>with each other in applying that ſort of flat­
<lb/>tery of which their venerable hoſteſs was moſt
<lb/>ſuſceptible. The General ſpoke in terms
<lb/>of the higheſt reſpect of her ancient family,
<lb/>and of the figure made in hiſtory by the 
          <lb/>name of <name>Rayland</name>. The Doctor, while he
<lb/>did juſtice to the excellent diſhes before
<lb/>him, launched out in very ſincere praiſe of
<lb/>the domain which produced them: the
<lb/>beautiful park which, he averred, fed the
<lb/>very beſt veniſon in the country; the
<lb/>woods abounding in game; the exten­
<lb/>ſive ponds, whoſe living ſtreams contained
<lb/>all manner of fiſh; the rich meadows be­
<lb/>low, that fatted ſuch exquiſite beef; the
<lb/>fine ſheep walks on the downs above, which

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">179</mw>
<lb/>ſent to table mutton that rivalled the Welch
<lb/>mutton itſelf!—then, ſuch gardens for
<lb/>fruit! ſuch convenient poultry yards!――
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, who loved to hear her place
<lb/>praiſed, could have liſtened to ſuch eulo­
<lb/>giums for ever; and ſeemed totally to have
<lb/>forgotten that, according to the courſe of
<lb/>nature, ſhe ſhould be miſtreſs of theſe good 
<lb/>things but a very little time longer, and
<lb/>that, when a little ſpace in the chancel of
<lb/>the adjoining church would be all ſhe could
<lb/>occupy, they muſt paſs into the poſſeſ­
<lb/>ſion of another.</p>
            <p>Who that other was to be, appeared an
<lb/>enquiry which the Doctor had much at 
<lb/>heart. From ſome late circumſtances he had
          <lb/>reaſon to ſuppoſe that <persName>Orlando</persName> would be
<lb/>the fortunate poſſeſſor of all the excellent
<lb/>accommodations which impreſſed him with 
<lb/>ſo much veneration:—but he now ſaw the

            <lb/>Rayland</persName>, he doubted to which of the <name>Some­
<lb/>rives</name> it would be politic to pay court.</p>
            <p>Some ideas were floating in his mind,
<lb/>that whichever of theſe young men be­
          <lb/>came maſter of <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName>, could not
<lb/>fail to be a very proper match for the moſt 
          <lb/>accompliſhed <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>. It was
<lb/>certain that he had always reckoned upon a 
<lb/>title for her; but ſuch a deficiency might
<lb/>eaſily be made up by the ſucceſſor to ſuch 
<lb/>a fortune. What ſo eaſy as to change a 
<lb/>name by the King's moſt gracious licenſe?
<lb/>and to renew the old title of Baronet,
          <lb/>which had been ſo long in the family?—<persName>Sir
            <lb/>Philip Rayland</persName>! <persName>Sir Orlando Rayland</persName>!
<lb/>either ſounded extremely well. Both were
<lb/>very well looking young men, and the 
<lb/>youngeſt remarkably handſome. The more
<lb/>the Doctor conſidered this project, the
<lb/>more feaſible it appeared; and he now be­
<lb/>gan to ſtudy the chances, which he thought
          <lb/>he could do from <persName>Mrs Rayland's</persName> beha­

            <p>A very little obſervation determined

<lb/>ners were cold and ſtately. When dinner
<lb/>was over, the gentlemen, after a ſhort ſtay
<lb/>over their wine, followed the ladies to an­
          <lb/>other apartment. <persName>General Tracy</persName> was, at
          <lb/>the deſire of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, ſhewn into the
          <lb/>gallery of portraits by <persName>Orlando</persName>—and the
          <lb/>young ladies, at the requeſt of <persName>Miſs Holly­
<lb/>bourn</persName>, who had never ſeen all the pictures
<lb/>in the houſe, were permitted by their mo­
          <lb/>ther to be of the party; while <persName>Philip Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, who went out under pretence of ac­
<lb/>companying them, ſlipped away as ſoon as
<lb/>he left the drawing-room, and went after
<lb/>his own imagination.</p>
            <p>It was now dark, and theſe portraits were
          <lb/>to be ſhewn by candle-light to <persName>General
<lb/>Tracy</persName>, who cared not a ſtraw if the whole
          <lb/>race of <name>Raylands</name> had been ſwept from the
<lb/>memory of mankind; though he had,
<lb/>partly by gueſs, and partly from recollection,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">been</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">182</mw>
          <lb/>been inceſſantly talking to <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> 
<lb/>about the glory of her anceſtors. By this
<lb/>he perceived he had made a very unex­
<lb/>pected progreſs in her favour; which he
<lb/>would by no means forfeit by ſhewing any
<lb/>indifference to her propoſal of viſiting the
<lb/>repreſentations of the eminent men in whoſe
<lb/>praiſe he had been ſo eloquent. But a much
<lb/>ſtronger inducement was his hope to find
<lb/>an opportunity of ſpeaking to Iſabella,
<lb/>while he pretended to contemplate with
<lb/>admiration the picture of her great grand­
<lb/>father.</p>
            <p>But this hope was rendered abortive by the
          <lb/>preſence of <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, who, leaning
            <lb/>on <persName>Iſabella's</persName> arm, continued to queſtion
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> as to the hiſtory of every portrait,
<lb/>and then made her remarks upon it—ſome­
<lb/>times addreſſing herſelf to the General, and 
          <lb/>ſometimes to <persName>Orlando</persName>, who were equally 
<lb/>weary of her, and who would both have
          <lb/>given the world for her abſence; for <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> dreaded her detaining him beyond
<lb/>the time that he had fixed for the meeting
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">between</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">183</mw>
          <lb/>between his ſiſter <persName>Selina</persName> and <persName>Monimia</persName>;
<lb/>and the General deteſted her for being
<lb/>in the way when he fancied he could other­
<lb/>wiſe, by ſome means or other, have enjoyed
          <lb/>that notice from <persName>Iſabella</persName> which he found
<lb/>it ſo very difficult to obtain in the houſe of
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>; where, ſince he had ſpoke
<lb/>more plainly to her of his paſſion, ſhe had
<lb/>not only ſhunned him, but had aſſured
<lb/>him that ſhe would repeat his converſa­
<lb/>tion to her father. Twice, therefore, he had
<lb/>been forced to apologize, and turn off his
<lb/>profeſſions as a joke, becauſe he could never
<lb/>find her long enough alone to allow of his
<lb/>uſing thoſe arguments that he thought muſt
<lb/>be ſucceſsful; and he had been eagerly
          <lb/>ſolicitous to accept the invitation from <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, becauſe he hoped that, in ſuch a
<lb/>great houſe, in a day of univerſal feſtivity,
<lb/>ſuch an opportunity would be found.</p>
            <p><persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, having ſufficiently
<lb/>ſhewn her knowledge both in painting and 
<lb/>hiſtory, and imagining her auditors were
<lb/>amazed and edified by both, requeſted to

<lb/>know if the houſe did not furniſh many 
<lb/>other portraits of remarkable perſons, or
          <lb/>pictures by eminent hands. <persName>Orlando</persName> an­
<lb/>ſwered coldly, that there were ſome in
<lb/>other parts of the houſe, but none particu­
<lb/>larly worthy her attention. She deſired,
<lb/>however, he would have the goodneſs to
<lb/>ſhew her round that ſuit of rooms. It was
<lb/>the ſide of the houſe formerly ſet apart for
<lb/>company, but now was very rarely inha­
<lb/>bited. The furniture was rich, but old
<lb/>faſhioned:—the beds were of cut velvet
<lb/>or damaſk, with high teſters, ſome of them
<lb/>with gilt cornices:—the chairs were
<lb/>worked, or of coloured velvets, fringed with
<lb/>ſilk and gold, and had gilt feet:—fine ja­
<lb/>panned cabinets, beautiful pieces of china,
<lb/>large glaſſes, and ſome valuable pictures,
<lb/>were to be ſeen in every room, which,
<lb/>though now ſo rarely inhabited, were kept
<lb/>in great order; and the oak floors were ſo
<lb/>nicely waxed, that to move upon them
<lb/>was more like ſkating than walking.</p>

<lb/>on every object ſhe beheld. One beſpoke
<lb/>the grandeur, another the taſte, a third the
<lb/>antiquity of the family who were owners
<lb/>of the manſion; but ſtill, among all this
<lb/>common-place declamation, it was eaſy to
<lb/>ſee that the moſt amiable moveable in it
<lb/>at preſent was, in her opinion, the hand­
<lb/>ſome, intereſting <persName>Orlando</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>General Tracy</persName>, accuſtomed to ſtudy the
<lb/>fair, perceived this immediately. He per­
          <lb/>ceived too, that <persName>Orlando</persName> diſliked her as 
<lb/>much as ſhe ſeemed charmed with him,
<lb/>and that therefore this rich heireſs would
<lb/>not be the means of preventing the plan
<lb/>they had in agitation from taking effect.
<lb/>He therefore ventured to ſay to him,
<lb/>when he had an opportunity as they de­
          <lb/>ſcended the great ſtair-caſe—<said>You are a
<lb/>fortunate man, Sir!</said></p>

<lb/>young men would, I believe, think it for­
<lb/>tunate to be ſo highly approved of by ſuch 
            <lb/>a young lady!</said></p>
            <p><said>What lady, Sir?</said> cried <persName>Orlando</persName>, in
          <lb/>increaſed alarm, and ſtill thinking of <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>.</p>
            <p><said>Miſs Hollybourn,</said> replied the Ge­
          <lb/>neral—<said>the accompliſhed <persName>Miſs Holly­

            <p><said><persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>!</said> exclaimed <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>with a contemptuous look; yet recollect­
<lb/>ing that he had no right to deſpiſe her,
<lb/>whether the General's conjecture was juſt
          <lb/>or not, he added, <said>The approbation of
            <lb/><emph>ſuch</emph> a young lady is certainly what I
<lb/>neither deſire nor deſerve.</said></p>
            <p>This paſſed as they waited on the ſtair-
          <lb/>caſe, while <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName> explained to
          <lb/>the two <persName>Miſs Somerives</persName> the <title ref="b:IT03007">Loves of Cupid 
<lb/>and Pſyche</title>, which were painted on the 
<lb/>wall; though the picture was ſo little illu­
<lb/>minated by the two wax-candles, carried by
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> and a ſervant, that nothing but

<lb/>ledge, could have induced her to attempt
<lb/>clearing up the obſcurity in which the
<lb/>wavering and unequal light involved a
<lb/>ſtory not very clearly told by the painter.
<lb/>At length the diſſertation finiſhed; and the
<lb/>whole party returned to the drawing-room,
<lb/>where they found the good Doctor had
<lb/>ſupported the converſation during their ab­
<lb/>ſence. In about half an hour afterwards
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Pattenſon</persName> came in great form to an­
<lb/>nounce that the tenants were aſſembled in
<lb/>the hall, and requeſted to know if their
<lb/>Lady was well enough to oblige them with
<lb/>her preſence during their firſt dance. This
          <lb/>was the eſtabliſhed etiquette. <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName> anſwered, that ſhe would be there; and
<lb/>then addreſſing herſelf to the company, ſhe
          <lb/>ſaid, <said>That it had always been her cuſtom
            <lb/>in the time of <persName>Sir Hildebrand</persName>, her father, to
<lb/>lead down, with her dear deceaſed ſiſters,
<lb/>the firſt dance at the tenants' feaſt; that
<lb/>the cuſtom had been long ſince laid aſide;

<lb/>deſcend to go down a dance with the te­
<lb/>nantry and domeſtics――</said></p>
            <p>The General and the Doctor eagerly in­
<lb/>terrupted her—</p>
            <p><said>I am not a dancing man, Madam,</said><lb/>cried the General: <said>I never was fond
<lb/>of dancing. How much I now, in looking
<lb/>at that beautiful group of young ladies,
<lb/>have cauſe to regret it! and much I ſhall 
<lb/>envy the young men, who no doubt will
<lb/>take advantage of ſuch an opportunity.</said></p>
            <p><said>I, Madam,</said> cried the Doctor, quitting

            <p><said>No, no, child!</said> cried <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>;
          <lb/><said>not at all—you are, <emph>as it were</emph>, at home

<lb/>Beſides, I don't ſee your brother:—when he

          <lb/>much. She knew that, rich as <persName>Doctor Hol­
<lb/>lybourn</persName> now was, he began his claſſical ca­
          <lb/>reer as a ſervitor at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>; and that his
          <lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">brother-in-law the biſhop,</said> from whoſe
<lb/><emph>nepotiſm</emph> his wealth and conſequence had
<lb/>been in a great meaſure derived, was the
<lb/><choice><sic> </sic><corr>s</corr></choice>on of an innkeeper. Though ſhe always
<lb/>ſpoke highly of his piety, and his high­
<lb/>church principles, ſhe had ever contemned
<lb/>his efforts to make himſelf be conſidered as
<lb/>a man of family: nor did ſhe feel much
<lb/>diſpoſed to encourage any ſcheme to make
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> independent of her by marriage,
<lb/>ſtill leſs an attempt to extort from her a

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">197</mw>
<lb/>deciſion concerning him; which, whatever
<lb/>her real ſentiments might be, ſhe was not
<lb/>of a temper to declare. For all theſe rea­
          <lb/>ſons ſhe heard the converſation of <persName>Doctor
<lb/>Hollybourn</persName> very coldly, and only ſaid,
          <lb/><said>that to be ſure Miſs was a very accom­
<lb/>pliſhed young lady; and, having ſuch a
<lb/>fine fortune, might expect to marry in high
<lb/>life.</said></p>
            <p>Still the Doctor was not repulſed; and,
<lb/>fancying that he had not yet ſpoke plain
<lb/>enough, he went on to enlarge on his no­
<lb/>tions of happineſs, and on his views for his
<lb/>daughter. High life, he ſaid, in the com­
<lb/>mon acceptation of the word, was not his
<lb/>ambition. It was real domeſtic happineſs,
<lb/>and not unneceſſary and unmeaning ſplen­
<lb/>dour, he deſired for his dear girl—a good
<lb/>huſband untainted with the vices and falſe
<lb/>philoſophy of a diſſolute age—an hand­
<lb/>ſome country reſidence, where ſhe might
<lb/>be received into an ancient and religious 
          <lb/>family—were rather his objects. <said>A title,</said>
          <lb/>added he, <said>a title has its advantages no

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">198</mw>
<lb/>doubt, and eſpecially if it be an ancient
<lb/>title, one that brings to the mind the deeds
<lb/>of the glorious defenders of our country—
<lb/>men who have ſhed their honourable blood
<lb/>in defence of the <orgName>Church of England</orgName>, and
<lb/>their King—who bled in the cauſe for which
<lb/><persName>Laud</persName> and his ſainted maſter died! When
<lb/>I hear ſuch names, and ſee their poſterity
<lb/>flouriſhing, I rejoice—When I learn that
<lb/>ſuch families, the honour of degenerate
            <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, are likely to be extinct, my
<lb/>heart is grieved. And how ſhould I be
            <lb/>thankful, how feel myſelf elevated, if <emph>my</emph>
<lb/>daughter, marrying into ſuch a family,
            <lb/>ſhould reſtore it, while <emph>my</emph> intereſt might
<lb/>obtain a renewal in her poſterity of the fad­
<lb/>ing honours of an illuſtrious race!</said></p>
            <p>This was ſpeaking at once pompouſly
          <lb/>and plainly. But <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was more
<lb/>offended by the air of conſequence aſſum­
<lb/>ed by the Doctor, than flattered by the fine
<lb/>things he ſaid of her family; and ſhe ſo
          <lb/>little concealed her diſpleaſure, that <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Somerive</persName>, long weary of the parading and

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">199</mw>
          <lb/>ſupercilious converſation of <persName>Mrs. Holly­
<lb/>bourn</persName>, and who ſaw, by the Doctor's fre­
          <lb/>quently looking towards <persName>Orlando</persName>, that the
          <lb/>diſcourſe was about him, and that <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName> was diſpleaſed with it, aroſe and
<lb/>came towards them: ſhe ſaid ſomething to
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> merely with a view to break
<lb/>the diſcourſe, which was, however, imme­
<lb/>diately done much better by the General,
<lb/>who, afraid of being too particular, now
          <lb/>left <persName>Iſabella</persName>; and returning to the ſeat
          <lb/><persName>Doctor Hollybourn</persName> had ſeized, he cried,
          <lb/><said>Come, come, my good Doctor, we ſol­
<lb/>diers are a little proud of our favour with
<lb/>the ladies, and we do not patiently ſee our­
<lb/>ſelves diſplaced by you churchmen. I ſhall
<lb/>not relinquiſh my ſeat by my excellent
<lb/>hoſteſs.</said></p>
            <p>The Doctor then got up; and fancying,
          <lb/>from the ſoftneſs and ſweetneſs of <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Somerive's</persName> manner, that he ſhould in her 
<lb/>meet a willing auditor, and perhaps the
<lb/>very beſt he could find for a ſcheme which
<lb/>acquired every moment new charms in his

<lb/>imagination, he aſked if he ſhould attend
<lb/>her to the other end of the room to look at
<lb/>the dancers; to which, as ſhe was extreme­
<lb/>ly reſtleſs and uneaſy by the long abſence 
<lb/>of her eldeſt ſon, whom ſhe every moment 
<lb/>hoped to ſee enter, ſhe readily aſſented.</p>
            <p>The General then took poſſeſſion of the
<lb/>poſt the Doctor had quitted; and being
<lb/>more uſed to every kind of approach, he
          <lb/>made infinitely more progreſs with <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Rayland</persName>, in obtaining her conſent to <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando's</persName> entering the army, than the Doctor
<lb/>had effected for his ſcheme, notwithſtand­
<lb/>ing the ſplendour of his fortune, the accom­
<lb/>pliſhments of his daughter, or his mention
          <lb/>of <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">his brother the biſhop.</said></p>
            <p>In the mean time the poor young man,
          <lb/>who was rendered by <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> fa­
<lb/>vour an object ſought for by the divine,
<lb/>and by his own ſpirit an object of dread to
<lb/>the ſoldier, was half diſtracted, and knew
<lb/>not what he was about. It was now paſt
          <lb/>the hour when he had promiſed <persName>Monimia</persName> 
          <lb/>to bring <persName>Selina</persName> to her; for, not expecting

          <lb/>the unwelcome addition of the <name>Hollybourn
<lb/>family</name>, he concluded that, after going
<lb/>down a dance with one of the buxom 
<lb/>daughters of the principal tenant, he could 
<lb/>have ſlipped away at the end of it; and
<lb/>whiſpering his mother that he was going to
          <lb/>ſhew <persName>Selina</persName> ſome of his drawings, and how
<lb/>he had ornamented his little tapeſtry room,
<lb/>that he might account for her abſence, he
<lb/>ſhould have had an uninterrupted hour
          <lb/>with his moſt beloved ſiſter and his <persName>Moni­
<lb/>mia</persName>.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of this, he now found himſelf fix­
          <lb/>ed for the whole night to <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>;
<lb/>who had already declared that ſhe found
<lb/>herſelf in ſuch a humour for dancing, and
<lb/>that really the whole ſet was ſo much more
<lb/>tolerable than ſhe expected, that ſhe ſhould 
          <lb/>not very ſoon wiſh to ſit down. Poor <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>, who had no excuſe to offer for quit­
<lb/>ting her, had no hope but in the arrival of 
<lb/>his brother, to whom he flattered himſelf
<lb/>he might reſign this unenvied honour at
<lb/>leaſt for one dance: but even this hope

          <lb/>was very uncertain; for <persName>Philip</persName> might per­
<lb/>haps return no more to the room, or, if he
<lb/>did, might be unwilling to accept the feli­
          <lb/>city of dancing with <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, for
<lb/>he was not of a humour to put himſelf out
<lb/>of the way for any one; and, as he very
<lb/>ſeldom danced at all, would now, if he did
<lb/>join the dancers, much more probably ſe­
<lb/>lect for his partner one of the handſome 
<lb/>daughters of the tenants, with whom he
<lb/>could be more at home.</p>
            <p>Thus the time which <persName>Orlando</persName> expected
<lb/>to have paſſed in ſo different a manner wore
<lb/>away. In vain he looked towards the 
<lb/>door—no brother arrived to ſuccour him.
<lb/>The ſecond dance was already at an end;
          <lb/>and <persName>Iſabella</persName>, who had, with her mo­
<lb/>ther's permiſſion, accepted the hand of a
          <lb/>rich young farmer, while <persName>Selina</persName> and <persName>Em­
<lb/>ma</persName> danced together, had already called a
<lb/>third, and was flying down with a ſpirit
<lb/>and gaiety which quite enchanted her an­
          <lb/>cient lover; while <persName>Orlando</persName>, who on account
          <lb/>of <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName> ſtill kept a place near

<lb/>the top, was preparing with an heavy heart 
<lb/>to follow her, when his father, with an
<lb/>expreſſion of extreme concern on his coun­
<lb/>tenance, approached, and aſked him if he 
<lb/>knew where his brother was?</p>
            <p><said>No, Sir, indeed I do not,</said> anſwered
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>; <said>I cannot even gueſs—but, for
<lb/>God's ſake, give me leave to go look for
<lb/>him. I ſee you are very uneaſy at his ab­
<lb/>ſence.</said></p>
            <p><said>I am indeed,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>,
          <lb/><said>and your mother much more ſo.</said></p>
            <p><said>Let me go, dear Sir, then,</said>, ſaid <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> eagerly.</p>
            <p><said>No, no,</said> anſwered his father:—<said>Go
<lb/>down this dance, and take no notice—if
<lb/>then he does not come, go ſee if you can
<lb/>find him. I have been in ſearch of him
<lb/>myſelf, but to no purpoſe.—I fancied he
<lb/>might be in your room. I went to the
<lb/>library door, for I could have ſworn I heard 
<lb/>ſomebody walking there; but the door was
<lb/>locked, and I called and knocked at it in
            <lb/>vain. If <persName>Philip</persName> was there, he had ſome

<lb/>ſwering.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, now ready to ſink into the
<lb/>earth, yet unable to fly from his intolerable
<lb/>taſk, began the dance, after having been
<lb/>twice called upon by his partner; but
          <lb/>thinking only of the terror <persName>Monimia</persName> muſt
<lb/>have been in, while ſhut up in the library
<lb/>ſhe heard his father at the door, and over­
<lb/>whelmed with vexation at being thus de­
<lb/>tained from her, he could no longer com­
<lb/>mand that portion of attnetion that was re­
<lb/>quiſite even to the figure of the dance. But
<lb/>having blundered four or five times, turn­
<lb/>ed the wrong women, and run againſt the
<lb/>men, then miſſed his time, and put every
<lb/>body out, he ſaid in a hurrying way to
          <lb/><persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, who began to be much
          <lb/>diſcompoſed by his miſtakes—<said>I really
            <lb/>beg a thouſand pardons, but <persName>Iſabella's</persName>
<lb/>dance is ſo extremely difficult I cannot go

<lb/>to come round another way, where he

<lb/>fearing leſt ſhe ſhould propoſe going too,

<lb/>not be made, or, if it were, might eaſily be
<lb/>anſwered.</p>
            <p>It was the cuſtom on theſe occaſions for
<lb/>the inferior ſervants not to come into the

<lb/>When the buſineſs of the dinner and tea ta­

            <p><persName>Monimia</persName> had been forbidden by <persName>Mrs.

<lb/>the intereſting ſweetneſs of her counte­
<lb/>nance, and the ſimple graces of her form,
          <lb/>ſhe feared leſt <persName>Selina</persName> might think her bro­
<lb/>ther's affection ill placed, and blame his
<lb/>attachment to an object of ſo little merit.
<lb/>Under theſe impreſſions, ſhe would have
<lb/>given herſelf all the advantages that dreſs
<lb/>afforded; but her ſcanty wardrobe left her
<lb/>very little choice, and ſhe had no means
<lb/>of varying her appearance from what it
<lb/>uſually was—a white muſlin gown being 
<lb/>the utmoſt of her finery. She took care,
<lb/>however, to diſpoſe her hair in the moſt
<lb/>becoming manner ſhe could; and having
<lb/>finiſhed her little toilet, ſhe deſcended with 
<lb/>a palpitating heart and a light ſtep to the 
<lb/>part of the houſe through which ſhe was to
<lb/>paſs in going to the Study. It was now
<lb/>empty, for all the ſervants were in the gal­
<lb/>lery, waiting the departure of their Lady, to
          <lb/>join the feſtivity of the night; and <persName>Moni­
<lb/>mia</persName> glided through the north wing, which
<lb/>was never at any time inhabited, and without
<lb/>any miſadventure reached the Study, where

<lb/>ſhe waited in trembling ſuſpenſe the arrival
          <lb/>of <persName>Orlando</persName> and <persName>Selina</persName>.</p>
            <p>Every body being engaged in the mid­
<lb/>dle of the houſe, that part of it was as
<lb/>ſilent as if there was no buſtle in the other,
<lb/>except the diſtant ſound of the muſic in
          <lb/>the great hall, to which <persName>Monimia</persName>, with the
<lb/>door of the Study a-jar, involuntarily liſten­
<lb/>ed; when ſhe was ſuddenly alarmed by a
<lb/>voice in the adjoining parlour, talking and
<lb/>laughing, and apparently romping, and a
<lb/>man's voice anſwering in a half whiſper,
<lb/>and begging of the firſt perſon, whom ſhe
          <lb/>knew to be <persName>Betty</persName>, to be more quiet. As
          <lb/>her being diſcovered in <persName>Orlando's</persName> Study
<lb/>would have ruined her peace for ever, ſhe
<lb/>ſhut-to the door as ſoftly as ſhe could,
<lb/>and turned the key. The converſation
<lb/>between the two people without appeared
<lb/>to be ſo animated, that ſhe flattered herſelf
<lb/>they did not hear her; but as ſhe ſtill re­
<lb/>mained liſtening at the door, hardly daring
<lb/>to breathe, her terror was increaſed by
<lb/>hearing them approach and attempt to open

          <lb/>it. <said>Egad! it is locked,</said> cried a voice
          <lb/>which <persName>Monimia</persName> then firſt diſcovered to be
          <lb/>young <persName>Somerive</persName>:—<said>Does <persName>Sir Rowland</persName>
<lb/>always lock his door?</said></p>
            <p><said>Generally he does,</said> replied the other, 
<lb/><said>but I dare ſay among the houſe keys
<lb/>there's one that will open it—yet, hang it,
<lb/>don't let us try. He'll come perhaps, and
<lb/>that you know will be very diſagreeable.</said></p>
            <p><said>He come!</said> ſaid <persName>Philip</persName>—<said>No, no,
<lb/>he's ſafe enough—He dares as well jump
<lb/>into the fire as quit the poſt where the old
<lb/>woman has placed him—Come, come—ſee
<lb/>if there's no other key will open this door.
<lb/>Beſides, as to his coming, what ſhould he
<lb/>come here for? 'Tis more likely, if he can
<lb/>get away, he'll go to viſit Miſs in the tur­
<lb/>ret.</said></p>
            <p><said>Lord!</said>, cried <persName>Betty</persName>, <said>how you have
<lb/>that notion ſtuffed into your head—when
<lb/>I tell you again and again, he no more
<lb/>meets Miſs, as you calls her, than the child 
<lb/>unborn. Sure I ſhould know――She! a

<lb/>he takes any account of her――But huſh!
<lb/>Oh gemini! who's there?</said></p>
            <p>The voice of the elder <persName>Somerive</persName> was
<lb/>now heard, calling aloud in the paſſage
<lb/>leading to the parlour they were in for his
          <lb/>eldeſt ſon. <said><persName>Philip</persName>!</said> cried he, <said><persName>Philip</persName>!
<lb/>—where are you?</said></p>
            <p><said>'Tis my father,</said> ſaid <persName>Philip</persName>—<said>Can­

            <p><said>Oh yes,</said> replied <persName>Betty</persName>; <said>follow me,
<lb/>and don't ſpeak for all the world.</said></p>
            <p>She then opened another door which led
          <lb/>out into the garden, which, as <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>uſually came in that way, was ſeldom lock­
<lb/>ed; and as all this had paſſed in the dark,
<lb/>they glided away unperceived—not a mo­
          <lb/>ment however before <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, enter­
<lb/>ing with a candle the room they had quit­
          <lb/>ted, gave a new alarm to the terrified <persName>Mo­
            <lb/>nimia</persName>. <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, who had heard the
<lb/>footſteps of the fugitives as they left the
<lb/>parlour, imagined ſomebody was walking 
<lb/>in the Study—He therefore tried the door
          <lb/>on the other ſide of which poor <persName>Monimia</persName>

<lb/>ſtill ſtood trembling, and again loudly call­
          <lb/>ed on <persName>Philip Somerive</persName>; entreating him, if
<lb/>he was there, to anſwer him, and repre­
<lb/>ſenting all the ill conſequences of his thus
<lb/>diſappearing abruptly, after having been
<lb/>received into an houſe where he had before
<lb/>given offence, but where it was ſo material
<lb/>for him to be thought well of. No anſwer
<lb/>however was returned; and at length
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> heard <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> cloſe his
<lb/>fruitleſs remonſtrance with a deep ſigh, and
<lb/>depart.</p>
            <p>Theſe repeated alarms now ſeemed to
<lb/>ſubſide, and a dead ſilence enſued, but ſtill
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> came not.—<persName>Monimia</persName>, not daring
<lb/>to have a candle leſt the light ſhould be
<lb/>diſcerned under the door, ſat down in the
<lb/>window-ſeat which was the neareſt to it to
<lb/>liſten for his arrival, though doubting from
<lb/>what his brother had ſaid whether he would
<lb/>arrive at all. The large old library, half
<lb/>furniſhed with books and half hung with
<lb/>tapeſtry, and where the little light afforded
<lb/>by a waning moon gleamed faintly through

<lb/>the upper parts of the high caſements which
<lb/>the window ſhutters did not reach, was
<lb/>perhaps the moſt gloomy apartment that
          <lb/>fancy could imagine. <persName>Monimia</persName> looked
<lb/>round her, and ſhuddered—The affright
<lb/>ſhe had undergone in the chapel, though
<lb/>it was explained, ſtill dwelt upon a mind
<lb/>which had ſo early been rendered liable to
<lb/>the terrors of ſuperſtition; and ſhe looked
<lb/>towards the door that opened to the paſ­
<lb/>ſage of the chapel, fancying ſome hideous
<lb/>ſpectre would appear at it: or ſhe reaſoned
<lb/>herſelf out of ſuch an idea, only to give
<lb/>way to one more horrid; and figured to
          <lb/>herſelf that the ruffian whom <persName>Orlando</persName> had
<lb/>deſcribed to her, and whoſe name was held
<lb/>in dread by the whole country, might en­
<lb/>ter at it as he had once done before.
<lb/>Againſt this apprehenſion ſhe might have
<lb/>been ſecured by ſatiſfying herſelf that the
<lb/>door was locked; but ſhe had not courage
<lb/>to croſs the room.</p>
            <p>Sitting therefore and liſtening to every 
<lb/>ſound, ſhe again diſtinguiſhed the muſic

<lb/>in the great hall, which, as the wind ſwell­
<lb/>ed or fell, floated through the reſt of the
<lb/>houſe; and ſhe could not help contraſting
<lb/>that ſcene of feſtive mirth with her dark
<lb/>and gloomy ſolitutde:—<said>How happy,</said>
<lb/>ſaid ſhe,
        <said>are the <persName>Miſs Somerives</persName>, and this
<lb/>other young lady! They, under the ſanction
<lb/>of their parents, are gaily enjoying an inno­
<lb/>cent and agreeable amuſement; while I, a
<lb/>poor unprotected being, wander about in
<lb/>darkneſs and in dread, and, though I do
<lb/>nothing wrong, undergo the terrors and
<lb/>alarms of guilt.—But, do I not act wrong?
          <lb/>Alas! I am afraid I do—It <emph>muſt</emph> be wrong
<lb/>to carry on a clandeſtine correſpondence,
<lb/>to meet by ſtealth a young man whom his
<lb/>friends would diſcard were they to know
<lb/>he met me at all—It muſt ſurely be wrong
<lb/>to incur imputations from which, if once
<lb/>they are believed, it is impoſſible I can ever 
          <lb/>be vindicated――wrong to let <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>hazard, for me, the loſs of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName>
<lb/>favour—and wrong to put myſelf in the way

<lb/>vant, of whoſe light conduct I have ſeen
<lb/>ſo many inſtances, beſides that which this
<lb/>moment happened, of her privately meeting
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Philip Somerive</persName>. How could I bear
<lb/>to be thought of by others as I think of her!
<lb/>and yet I ſeem to act as culpably. Oh
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>! ſurely if you thought of this,
<lb/>you, who are ſo generous, ſo anxious for
<lb/>my happineſs, would never expoſe me to it.
<lb/>Yet we muſt meet thus, or never meet at 
<lb/>all!—and could I bear to be deprived of
<lb/>ſeeing him for the little, the very little
<lb/>time that is yet to paſs before he is ſent
<lb/>from hence—never—never perhaps to re­
<lb/>turn?</said></p>
            <p>This ſad idea filled her eyes with tears;
<lb/>and ſhe was not recovered from the agony
<lb/>into which it threw her, when ſhe again
<lb/>heard footſteps in the parlour—Somebody
          <lb/>trode lightly along. <persName>Monimia</persName> liſtened, and
<lb/>fancied there was more than one perſon—
<lb/>Immediately the lock was turned; and the

          <lb/>cogniſed with joy for that of <persName>Orlando</persName>, ſaid,

          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> remembered, with affright, that
<lb/>the two voices of the two brothers bore a great
<lb/>reſemblance to each other, and ſhe again
          <lb/>heſitated.—But <persName>Orlando</persName> ſpeaking louder,
<lb/>and her recollecting that his brother could
          <lb/>not know that <persName>Selina</persName> was to accompany
<lb/>him, ſhe, though with trembling apprehen­
          <lb/>ſion, turned the key, and <persName>Orlando</persName> and his

            <p><said>Let me,</said> cried he, as he put <persName>Monimia</persName>

<lb/>for the firſt time beheld hiſ ſiſter, had rob­
<lb/>bed her fair cheeks of their tender bloom;
<lb/>her eyes were ſwollen, and her voice was
          <lb/>faltering and faint. <persName>Orlando</persName> ſeated her
          <lb/>near <persName>Selina</persName>, and, ſitting down by them,

            <lb/>Indeed, <persName>Orlando</persName>, if you did but know what
<lb/>I have ſuffered ſince I waited here in ex­
            <lb/>pectation of your coming!</said>――<said>I know
<lb/>it,</said> cried Orlando, imagining ſhe alluded
<lb/>to his father's having been at the door of
          <lb/>the Study—<said>But luckily you had taken 
<lb/>the precaution to lock the door; which I, 
<lb/>little ſuſpecting that this part of the houſe

<lb/>So, as my father neither ſaw nor ſuſpected

<lb/>quering the reſtraint ſhe had at firſt felt;
<lb/>and, charmed with the voice, the manner
          <lb/>and perſon of <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſhe eagerly entered
<lb/>into his views, and talked over the means
<lb/>by which they might ſometimes meet, if,
<lb/>as was too probable, invincible obſtacles
<lb/>continued to be oppoſed to their ſeeing 
          <lb/>each other by the conſent of <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs.

            <lb/>the ſiſters of <persName>Orlando</persName> will always be a com­

<lb/>pain the frequent mention he made of his

<lb/>vations ſhe had made on the behaviour of
          <lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName>, during his reſidence of

<lb/>the principal mover of the plan which was
<lb/>thus to rob her of her beloved brother.
<lb/>Whatever ſhe thought of his conduct in

<lb/>propoſed leading his ſiſter back to the room,
<lb/>and carrying her immediately to his mo­
<lb/>ther, to tell her that ſhe had been in his 
<lb/>apartment, that any ſurprize excited by
<lb/>her abſence might be ended without farther 
          <lb/>enquiry; while <persName>Monimia</persName> hoped to find her 
<lb/>way back to her own room, as ſafely as ſhe
<lb/>had before traverſed the houſe in her way
<lb/>from it.</p>
            <p>They were then reluctantly bidding
<lb/>adieu, when they were thunderſtruck by
<lb/>an attempt from without to force open the
          <lb/>door. <persName>Orlando</persName>, thrown for a moment entire­
<lb/>ly off his guard, turned pale; and, caſting
          <lb/>towards <persName>Monimia</persName> a look of anguiſh and
          <lb/>terror, he cried, <said>Who can it be? what
            <lb/>ſhall we do?</said>—The tender timid <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>had at this inſtant more preſence of mind
          <lb/>than he had: <said>Let me go,</said> ſaid ſhe,
          <lb/><said>into your bed-chamber—there I can
<lb/>lock myſelf in: then aſk who it is; and, if
<lb/>it is one who has a right to enquire into
<lb/>your actions, open the door, and let him
<lb/>ſee you are ſitting here with your ſiſter.</said>
<lb/>There was not a moment to deliberate, for

<lb/>was hung on both ſides with tapeſtry and
          <lb/>ſhut without noiſe, while <persName>Orlando</persName> demand­
<lb/>ed, in a loud and angry voice, who was at

<lb/>viſe, was in as great conſternation as the
          <lb/>half diſtracted <persName>Orlando</persName>, who walked about
<lb/>the room a moment, conſidering by what
<lb/>means he could diſengage himſelf from
<lb/>this troubleſome viſitor; but unable to
<lb/>think of any, he was beginning, in mere
<lb/>deſpair, to expoſtulate with him anew, when
<lb/>the approach of other perſons was heard in

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, then collecting his ſcattered

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">232</mw>
          <lb/>brought <persName>Selina</persName> thither for a few moments
<lb/>to ſhew her his apartments, which ſhe had
<lb/>never ſeen; and that, while they were ſit­
          <lb/>ting quietly together, <persName>Philip</persName>, <said>whoſe ſitu­
            <lb/>ation, Sir, you ſee,</said> ſaid he, <said>came in,
<lb/>and I could not prevail upon him to leave
<lb/>us, or to ſuffer us to return altogether to 
<lb/>the company.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, now ſpeaking with an air
<lb/>of authority and concern to his eldeſt ſon,
<lb/>received only an account of his requeſt to
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, which, he inſiſted upon it, was a
          <lb/>very reaſonable one. <said>You are indeed,</said>
          <lb/>ſaid his father, <said>fit only to go to bed; but
            <lb/>it muſt not be in <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> houſe—
<lb/>you muſt come, Sir, with me.</said></p>
            <p>Young <persName>Somerive</persName> then aroſe to obey; for
<lb/>his father, when he was preſent, and had
<lb/>reſolution to be peremptory, ſtill retained
<lb/>ſome power over him. He ſtaggered how­
<lb/>ever ſo much that he was unable to proceed.
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> bade <persName>Orlando</persName> aſſiſt him,
<lb/>which he was willing enough to do; but as
          <lb/><persName>Philip</persName> leaned upon him he whiſpered, <said>Sir

<pb n="2233"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">233</mw>
<lb/>Knight! if I can give the reverend ſenior
<lb/>the ſlip, I will ſtill have my nap, and finiſh 
<lb/>the evening with thoſe joyous ſouls; d—me
<lb/>if I don't!</said></p>
            <p>This threat terrified <persName>Orlando</persName> more than
<lb/>ever: he knew how likely it was to be exe­
<lb/>cuted; and therefore, in the hope that he
<lb/>might be able preſently to return and re­
          <lb/>leaſe <persName>Monimia</persName>, whoſe longer abſence from
<lb/>her room might be attended with the moſt
<lb/>alarming conſequences, he haſtily deter­
<lb/>mined to lock the Study door, and thus con­
<lb/>vince his brother that his ſcheme of returning
<lb/>thither, to which he ſaw he adhered either
<lb/>with the ſtupid obſtinacy of intoxication,
<lb/>or diſguiſing, under its appearance, know­
<lb/>ledge more deſtructive, was impracticable.
<lb/>He therefore, as ſoon as they were all out of 
<lb/>the room, locked the door, and, ſaying aloud
<lb/>he had done ſo, he proceeded before his fa­
<lb/>ther, with a candle in his hand, to the apart­
          <lb/>ment where <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, much fatigued
<lb/>with the exertions of the evening, was taking

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">234</mw>
          <lb/>leave of her gueſts. <persName>Philip</persName>, who ſeemed
<lb/>by no means in a condition to appear be­
<lb/>fore her, had been conſigned, in the way,
<lb/>to the care of one of the men-ſervants, who
<lb/>had ſeated him by the fire in a paſſage-
<lb/>parlour, where he was in a few moments
<lb/>faſt aſleep.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, to whom <persName>Selina's</persName> ab­
<lb/>ſence was eaſily accounted for, gently chid
<lb/>her for not ſaying whither ſhe was going;
<lb/>and the long ceremonies of good-night on
          <lb/>all hands being at length over, <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>handed to her coach the nymph whom he
<lb/>had, in her opinion, ſo ungallantly for­
<lb/>ſaken. He found her ſo much hurt at
<lb/>being made over to his brother, who proba­
<lb/>bly had not acquitted himſelf to her ſatiſ­
<lb/>faction, that he found it neceſſary to apo­
<lb/>logize, at which however he was extremely
<lb/>awkward, aſſuring her, with much heſita­
<lb/>tion, that he was not aware that ſhe would
<lb/>ſo ſoon quit the dancing-room, and that
<lb/>he flattered himſelf with the expectation of

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">235</mw>
<lb/>being honoured with her hand in a dance, 
<lb/>where he could acquit himſelf in a manner 
<lb/>more worthy ſo excellent a partner.</p>
            <p>The Lady received his excuſes with cold­
<lb/>neſs and diſdain; but the Doctor, who heard, 
<lb/>ſeemed more willing to accept them in good
          <lb/>part. <said>I never ſuſpected, Sir,</said> cried the
          <lb/>conſequential Divine, <said>that, with your un­
<lb/>derſtanding, you could fail to appreciate the
<lb/>Lady whoſe hand you held—It is not the
<lb/>fond partiality of the father, but common
<lb/>candour, which leads me to ſay, that of
<lb/>equals ſhe has few in merit, ſuperiors none.
            <lb/>I hope we ſhall meet here again, <persName>Mr. Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>; and that we ſhall ſee you, with good
            <lb/><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, and their fine fa­
            <lb/>mily, at <placeName>Combe Park</placeName>. Good <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName>, I heartily hope, that moſt worthy lady,
<lb/>who bears her years ſurpriſingly well, will
<lb/>be able, before the winter's rigorous ad­
<lb/>vances lay an embargo on valetudinarians;

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> bowed his aſſent to a ſpeech
<lb/>which he began to fear would laſt all night.
<lb/>—No effort of his, however, could have
<lb/>ſtopped the ſtream of the Doctor's elo­
<lb/>quence, when once it began to flow; but
          <lb/>fortunately <persName>Mrs. Hollybourn</persName> found it cold,
          <lb/>and ſaid peeviſhly, <said>Dear Doctor! you
            <lb/>keep <persName>Ann</persName> in a thorough air—Pray conſider

<lb/>could not for ſome time ſettle how they 
<lb/>ſhould return—the General being ſolici­
<lb/>tous to take two of the young ladies in his

<lb/>peremptorily objected, to the amazement 
<lb/>of her huſband, who, not having the leaſt
            <lb/>idea of her motives, cried, <said>Bleſs me, my

<lb/>Tracy</persName>, than to crowd him with me and
              <lb/><persName>Philip</persName>, who, if we can find him, is not, I
<lb/>fear, in a ſtate to travel without incommod­
              <lb/>ing his companions.</said>—<said>Well, then,</said> re­

<lb/>the General was obliged to acquieſce, and
<lb/>even to appear pleaſed with it, though it
<lb/>baffled the ſchemes he had been laying the

            <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>—But a new difficulty aroſe: his
<lb/>brother, for whom ſearch had been making, 
<lb/>as well in the room where he had been left 
<lb/>ſleeping, as in every other part of the houſe
<lb/>that had been opened for company, was
<lb/>no-where to be found.</p>
            <p>The <name>Somerive</name> family had all taken their
          <lb/>leave of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and waited in a

<lb/>found reaſon to fear that he had but too

<lb/>and will not commit any impropriety which
<lb/>ſhall expoſe him, or injure him in the opi­

              <said>Let me, Sir, go then, and ſeek for

<lb/>their remaining longer at the Hall contri­

            <p>When they were gone, <persName>Orlando</persName> hoped

            <p>With a palpitating heart then he went to

<lb/>paſſed through the adjoining parlour. She
<lb/>found all that end of the houſe deſerted,

<lb/>perhaps chooſe to ſet out again—if you have,

            <p><persName>Monimia</persName>, who dreaded nothing ſo much

<lb/>while her aunt was yet with her, haſtened

<lb/>ſpared not her lungs, nor was ſhe very nice
<lb/>in the choice of thoſe epithets which moſt

            <lb/>lando</persName>, impatient to know whether <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>was ſafe, and unable to ſet out in ſearch of
<lb/>his brother till he had obtained this ſatiſ­
<lb/>faction, ſoftly aſcended the narrow ſtairs,
<lb/>and in a moment was convinced that all
<lb/>their eſcapes, during this perilous evening,
<lb/>had ended in a complete diſcovery of their
<lb/>intelligence; for to nothing leſs could he
          <lb/>impute the fury in which <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>
<lb/>appeared to be. Under this impreſſion, 
<lb/>his ſpirits and temper quite exhauſted by
<lb/>the various perverſe accidents that had
<lb/>within a few hours befallen him—irritated 
<lb/>by frequent diſappointment, and indignant 
          <lb/>at the inſults to which he believed <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>was at the moment expoſed, he was on the
<lb/>point of burſting into her room, declaring 
<lb/>his affection for her, and meeting at once
<lb/>the invectives of her aunt, the renunciation
          <lb/>of all his hopes from <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">the</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="M5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">249</mw>
<lb/>the diſpleaſure of his own family. He blamed
<lb/>himſelf for not having before taken a ſtep
<lb/>which, whatever might be its future con­
<lb/>ſequence, would at leaſt be deciſive, and
          <lb/>ſave <persName>Monimia</persName> from thoſe cruel alarms and
<lb/>diſtreſſing conflicts to which his love had
<lb/>ſo long made her liable. But at the moment
<lb/>that his hand was lifted to execute this raſh
<lb/>purpoſe, the ſtorm within ſeemed to abate:
          <lb/>he heard <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> ſay—<said>I aſſure
<lb/>you, that the very next time I ſee or hear
<lb/>the leaſt grounds for believing you are car­
<lb/>rying on ſuch a correſpondence, that day 
<lb/>ſhall be the laſt of your ſtay under this
            <lb/>roof.</said> This gave <persName>Orlando</persName> hope that they
<lb/>might not be abſolutely diſcovered; and
<lb/>at the ſame moment the idea of his father
<lb/>made more unhappy, and deploring
<lb/>the fate that gave him two ſons equally 
<lb/>careleſs of their duty—of his beloved and
<lb/>affectionate mother weeping at the diſ­
<lb/>obedience of her children—aroſe forcibly
<lb/>to check his precipitate reſolution. He
          <lb/>heſitated; he liſtened; <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> ſpoke
          <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">M 5</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="M5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">250</mw>
<lb/>lower, but ſtill in a tone of remonſtrance
<lb/>and reproach. He determined to wait to
<lb/>ſpeak to <persName>Monimia</persName> after her departure, but
<lb/>ſhe ſeemed not likely to depart; and as he
<lb/>attentively liſtened to what he could not
<lb/>now very exactly diſtinguiſh, the terms
<lb/>in which ſhe expreſſed her indignation,
<lb/>he heard ſeveral voices calling him in the
<lb/>park. This was a new alarm—To iſſue 
<lb/>from the lower part of the turret at ſuch
<lb/>an hour, when it was impoſſible he could
<lb/>have any buſineſs there, was not to be
<lb/>thought of: yet the door was not cloſed, and
<lb/>he believed it not improbable that the people
<lb/>who were he apprehended in ſearch of his
          <lb/>brother, might at length ſeek <emph>him</emph> there; as
<lb/>his intoxication, when he was miſſing, might 
<lb/>lead them to imagine that he might have
<lb/>gone into ſome of the buildings and have
<lb/>fallen aſleep. He deſcended therefore, and
<lb/>waited at the door. The voices were now
<lb/>at a diſtance; and apparently being near
          <lb/>the apartment of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, the per­
<lb/>ſons who had before called aloud were
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">afraid</mw>
<pb n="2251"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">251</mw>
<lb/>afraid of diſturbing her. He ſeized this
<lb/>opportunity of eſcaping; and, following the
<lb/>ſound, which was ſtill heard at intervals,
<lb/>he met at length the groom and the under
          <lb/>footman, who told him that <persName>Mr. Philip
<lb/>Somerive</persName> had returned about a quarter of
<lb/>an hour before into the room, where he 
<lb/>was now ſo extremely riotous that he had
<lb/>got into a quarrel with one of the young 
<lb/>farmers; that he had ſtripped to box; and
<lb/>that every interpoſition of theirs only ſerved
<lb/>to enrage him more. They therefore be­
          <lb/>ſought <persName>Orlando</persName> to return into the hall, that
<lb/>he might appeaſe and prevail upon his
<lb/>brother to go home; for that their Lady,
<lb/>already alarmed by the noiſe, had ſent
<lb/>down orders to have the houſe immediately
<lb/>ſhut up, and for the people to depart. A
<lb/>thouſand times during the courſe of this
          <lb/>evening had poor <persName>Orlando</persName> execrated his
<lb/>own folly, that had thus brought his brother
<lb/>into an houſe, where, while he had been
<lb/>ſuch an unceaſing torment to him, he had
<lb/>probably effectually ruined himſelf. But

<pb n="2252"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">252</mw>
<lb/>there was not now a moment to give way
<lb/>to theſe repentant reflections. He haſten­
<lb/>ed therefore into the room, where his brother,
<lb/>awakened from the ſtupor of drunkenneſs
<lb/>into its moſt extravagant phrenſy, had taken
<lb/>ſome offence at a young man of the com­
<lb/>pany, and was now withheld only by the
<lb/>united ſtrength of three ſtout farmers from
          <lb/>fighting. <persName>Orlando</persName> for ſome time argued 
          <lb/>and implored in vain. The fury of <persName>Philip</persName> 
<lb/>only changed its object, and was directed 
<lb/>againſt him. But with his opponent, whoſe
<lb/>blunt Engliſh ſpirit was not, as he declared,
          <lb/><said>at all diſposed to yield tamely to the in­
<lb/>ſults of any 'ſquire, no not the biggeſt
<lb/>'ſquire in the king's dominions,</said> the
          <lb/>cool reaſoning of <persName>Orlando</persName> had more effect.
<lb/>He ſoothed then this juſtly offended ruſtic,
          <lb/>and, promiſing that <persName>Philip</persName> ſhould hereafter
<lb/>acknowledge the impropriety of his beha­
<lb/>viour, he prevailed on him to depart with
          <lb/><persName>Pattenſon</persName> and ſome other of the men into
<lb/>another room; and then his brother being
<lb/>almoſt exhauſted, and relapſing again into

          <lb/>ſtupidity, <persName>Orlando</persName> wiſhed to conduct him
<lb/>home. This was however, on conſideration,
<lb/>found to be impoſſible; for he was equally
<lb/>unable to ride or walk, even with the aſſiſt­
          <lb/>ance which <persName>Orlando</persName> was very ready to lend
<lb/>him. In this dilemma nothing remained
<lb/>but to put him into his own bed; where
          <lb/>being at a great diſtance from <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName>, there was no probability of her 
<lb/>knowing the ſtate to which his intemper­
<lb/>ance had reduced him. This then he de­
          <lb/>termined to do. <persName>Pattenſon</persName> and a party of
<lb/>the men who were in habits of drinking 
<lb/>had already withdrawn: the women were
<lb/>huddling away to their reſpective homes;
          <lb/>and <persName>Orlando</persName>, with the help of the groom,
          <lb/>carried off the almoſt ſenſeleſs <persName>Philip</persName> to
<lb/>his own bed-chamber, where he left him
<lb/>on his bed; and then, haraſſed and un­
<lb/>happy as he was, fatigued with all that had
<lb/>happened, and torn to pieces with anxiety
          <lb/>about <persName>Monimia</persName>, he yet had another taſk
<lb/>to perform, which he felt, however painful,
<lb/>to be neceſſary—and this was, to walk to
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">Weſt</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">254</mw>
          <lb/><placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, that, by his account of
          <lb/><persName>Philip</persName>, he might quiet the fears of his father
<lb/>as to his perſonal ſafety.</p>
            <p>He arrived there, quite worn out with
<lb/>uneaſineſs; and the pale countenance and
<lb/>diſhevelled hair with which he entered the
<lb/>parlour, ſeemed to confirm all the fears
          <lb/>with which the unfortunate <persName>Somerive</persName> had
<lb/>been tormented on account of his eldeſt
<lb/>ſon. He found him walking backwards 
<lb/>and fowards in the parlour, liſtening to
<lb/>every noiſe; and he had paſſed the whole
<lb/>interval in this manner, except that he had
<lb/>now and then gone up ſtairs to his wife,
<lb/>whom he had prevailed upon to go to bed,
<lb/>to perſuade her to mitigate thoſe fears under
<lb/>which he was himſelf agonized. At this
          <lb/>juncture the appearance of <persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe 
<lb/>looks ſeemed to ſpeak only of ſome ſad
<lb/>cataſtrophe, deprived his father for a mo­
<lb/>ment of the power of aſking what intelli­
<lb/>gence he brought; and when he could
          <lb/>ſpeak, it was only to ſay—<said><persName>Orlando</persName>! your

          <lb/>of his father, <said>you conſider this matter
<lb/>more ſeriouſly than it deſerves, and are

<lb/>pened, ſoftening however his brother's folly
<lb/>as much as he could; and aſſured his father
          <lb/>that he would take care <persName>Philip</persName> ſhould re­
          <lb/>turn in the morning, and that <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName> ſhould be kept ignorant of the con­
<lb/>fuſion his intemperance had occaſioned.</p>
            <p><said>You are a noble and excellent creature,
            <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName></said>, cried <persName>Somerive</persName>, with a ſigh as
<lb/>if his heart would break; <said>but God knows
<lb/>what will become of your unhappy brother.
<lb/>This relapſe into debauchery, ſo degrading,
<lb/>awakens all my fears—fears, which a little
<lb/>ſubſided on his unexpected return home.
<lb/>But it is not an hour, my dear boy, to
<lb/>detain you with the miſery that I ſee awaits

<lb/>us all. Since you have given up your bed
            <lb/>to <persName>Philip</persName>, I deſire you will take one here,
<lb/>while I haſten to quiet the anxiety which
<lb/>has almoſt overcome your poor mother,
<lb/>who imagined nothing leſs than that her
<lb/>ſon was drowned, or that ſome other horrid
<lb/>calamity had befallen him.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> then departed; and <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>, though ſomewhat comforted by hav­
<lb/>ing the power to relieve the ſad ſolicitude
<lb/>of his parents, was infinitely too uneaſy to
<lb/>feel any inclination to ſleep, though he was
<lb/>so greatly fatigued. It was by this time day­
<lb/>light; and, after ſome reflection, he reſolved
<lb/>to return back to the Hall, and to await in
<lb/>the library the hour when he ſhould be de­
<lb/>livered from the unwelcome inmate whom
<lb/>he had been compelled to admit. Every
<lb/>other anxiety however that aſſailed him
<lb/>was unfelt, when he thought of the ſituation
          <lb/>in which he had left <persName>Monimia</persName>. The harſh
          <lb/>tones in which the threats of <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> 
<lb/>were delivered ſtill rung in his ears; and
<lb/>his fancy repreſented the lovely victim of
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">her</mw>
<pb n="2257"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">257</mw>
<lb/>her ill humour drowned in tears, yielding
<lb/>to deſpair, and perhaps recollecting with
<lb/>anguiſh and regret the moments ſhe had
<lb/>given to his importunate love. It was
<lb/>broad day by the time he returned to the
<lb/>Hall, and the workmen and gardeners
<lb/>were diſperſed about the houſe. He dared
<lb/>not therefore indulge himſelf with another
<lb/>viſit to the turret; but having with ſome
<lb/>difficulty obtained admittance from the
<lb/>tired and ſleepy ſervants, he wrapped him­
<lb/>ſelf in his great coat, and ſat down in the
<lb/>Study, where he eaſily diſcovered, by the 
<lb/>loud ſnoring from the adjoining room, that
          <lb/><persName>Philip</persName> was ſleeping away the effects of the
<lb/>powerful draughts of the preceding night.
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, half tempted to envy the ſtate of
<lb/>forgetfulneſs into which he had fallen, oc­
<lb/>cupied himſelf in reflecting on the ſtrange 
<lb/>and perverſe accidents of the evening, in
          <lb/>which he and <persName>Monimia</persName> had trembled ſo
<lb/>often on the brink of diſcovery—perhaps
<lb/>were diſcovered, juſt at the time when they
<lb/>had flattered themſelves with the hope that
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">they</mw>
<pb n="2258"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">258</mw>
<lb/>they might the more ſecurely meet. He
<lb/>revolved all that was likely to happen if
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> was really acquainted with
<lb/>their correſpondence; and heſitated not to
<lb/>reſolve, in that caſe, to go to his father, to
          <lb/>declare his affection for <persName>Monimia</persName>, and to
<lb/>reſcue her from the tyranny of her aunt,
<lb/>whatever might enſue. On the other hand, 
<lb/>if their acquaintance yet remained doubtful,
<lb/>or only ſuſpected, he ſaw that prudence
          <lb/>and duty, his tenderneſs for <persName>Monimia</persName>, and
<lb/>his affection for his father, equally dictated
<lb/>their preſent ſeparation; and that, to which­
<lb/>ever of theſe he liſtened, they agreed in
          <lb/>pointing out his leaving <persName>Monimia</persName> now, to
<lb/>acquire ſome eſtabliſhment which might
<lb/>give them at leaſt a probability, without
<lb/>the breach of any duty, of being happily
<lb/>united hereafter. There was ſomething
<lb/>humiliating to his ingenuous mind, in all 
<lb/>the arts and prevarications which their
<lb/>clandeſtine correſpondence compelled him
<lb/>to uſe himſelf, and to teach the innocent 
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>. A thouſand times he wiſhed
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">that</mw>
<pb n="2259"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">259</mw>
<lb/>that he had been born the ſon of a day-
<lb/>labourer; that his parents, entertaining for
<lb/>him no views of ambition, had left him to
<lb/>purſue his own inclinations. A thouſand 
          <lb/>times he lamented that <persName>Monimia</persName> was not
          <lb/>circumſtanced like <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, that
<lb/>he might openly have addreſſed her: and
<lb/>the image of the arrogant heireſs aroſe with
<lb/>redoubled diſguſt to his mind, when he
<lb/>compared her ſituation with that of his de­
          <lb/>ſolate, orphan'd <persName>Monimia</persName>. More than
<lb/>three hours paſſed away while theſe
<lb/>thoughts were fluctuating in his mind.
<lb/>At the end of that time he was arouſed by
          <lb/>the entrance of <persName>Betty</persName>, who pertly demand­
<lb/>ed if he did not chooſe any breakfaſt?</p>
            <p>He deſired to have it brought. To which
          <lb/>the girl replied, <said>Perhaps you had rather
            <lb/>breakfaſt with the old woman?</said>—<said>Whom
            <lb/>do you mean?</said> enquired <persName>Orlando</persName>.</p>

<lb/>ſhould I mean, but miſtreſs, and mother
            <lb/><persName>Lennard</persName>? There's no other old woman in
<lb/>the houſe as I knows on, nor there had

<lb/>not need. They've been enquiring after 
<lb/>you.</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>After me?</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Yes,</said> replied <persName>Betty</persName>. <said>And Madam
<lb/>I ſuppoſe will tie you on to her apron-ſtring 
<lb/>ſoon, for ſhe is never eaſy without you.
            <lb/>Upon my word, <persName>Mr. Orlando</persName>, you look a

<lb/>too that you did not demean yourſelf with
<lb/>dancing as you uſed to do with us ſervants,
<lb/>after the gentlefolks were gone. I warrant
<lb/>however that you did not paſs the time at
<lb/>prayers.</said></p>
            <p><said>You give your tongue ſtrange licenſe,</said><lb/>ſaid <persName>Orlando</persName>, who endeavoured to conceal
<lb/>his vexation, for he imagined that all al­
          <lb/>luded to <persName>Monimia</persName>. <said>However, do tell
            <lb/>me, if <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> wiſhes me to break­
<lb/>faſt with her?</said></p>
            <p><said>I knows nothing about her wiſhes,</said><lb/>replied the girl; <said>I only knows that <persName>Lennard</persName>
<lb/>have been aſking every ſervant in the houſe
<lb/>about you, and croſs-queſtioning one ſo

<lb/>that I ſuppoſe ſhe thoft I had got you locked
<lb/>up in my cupboard, as they ſay ſhe uſed
<lb/>for to have the men-folk in her younger 
<lb/>days in the houſekeeper's ſtore-room. The
<lb/>old woman and the oven for that! Set a 
<lb/>thief to catch a thief!</said></p>
            <p><said>I do deſire,</said> ſaid <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>that
<lb/>you would have done with all this, and tell
            <lb/>me whether <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> expects me at
            <lb/>breakfaſt? <choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice>However,</said> added he, pauſ­
<lb/>ing, <said>I will alter my dreſs, and wait upon 
<lb/>her at all events; and do be ſo good as to 
<lb/>prepare in the mean time ſome breakfaſt for
<lb/>my brother.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Betty</persName> then left him apparently with plea­
<lb/>ſure to execute this laſt commiſſion; and
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, after changing his clothes, went
          <lb/>to <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> room, to enquire whether
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> wiſhed to ſpeak to him, and
<lb/>at what time he might wait upon her. This
<lb/>however was not his only motive; he
<lb/>thought he ſhould immediately diſcern by
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> reception of him, whether
<lb/>his fears of a partial or an entire diſcovery

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">262</mw>
<lb/>were well founded. He fortunately found
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> in the houſekeeper's room;
<lb/>and, accoſting her with his uſual intereſting
          <lb/>addreſs, he enquired how <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> 
<lb/>did after the fatigues of the evening, how
<lb/>ſhe was herſelf, and whether he might at
<lb/>any time that morning make a perſonal
          <lb/>enquiry after <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>?</p>
            <p>The ſage houſekeeper received his civi­
<lb/>lities with great coldneſs, and anſwered, even
          <lb/>with ſome aſperity, that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was
<lb/>much better than ever ſhe could have expect­
          <lb/>ed after ſo much company. <said>As to your en­
            <lb/>quiry after her, Sir,</said> added ſhe, <said>I don't
<lb/>know indeed how that may be; perhaps
<lb/>(fixing on him her penetrating eyes) there
            <lb/>are <emph>other</emph> people in the houſe after whom
            <lb/>you would <emph>rather</emph> aſk.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe conſcious blood roſe into
<lb/>his cheeks at this ſpeech, felt them glow,
<lb/>and the ſenſation increaſed his confuſion.
          <lb/><said>No,</said> replied he, heſitating. <said>No,

            <lb/>that I wiſh to enquire after more than <persName>Mrs. 
<lb/>Rayland</persName> ..... I was much afraid that
<lb/>the fatigue would be too much for her.</said></p>
            <p><said>There are other people,</said> replied the
          <lb/>lady, <said>who were fatigued alſo.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> I muſt 
            <lb/>beg the favour of you, <persName>Mr. Orlando</persName>, not to
<lb/>interfere with my niece. I ſuppoſe it was
<lb/>by your deſire or contrivance that ſhe took
<lb/>the liberty of leaving her room laſt night,
<lb/>contrary to my poſitive orders.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, a little recovered from his con­
<lb/>ſternation, endeavoured to laugh this off, and
          <lb/>was proving to <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> that it was im­
          <lb/>poſſible for <emph>him</emph> to have occaſioned this diſ­
<lb/>obedience, when a ſummons came for her

            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> now ſtalked away with

              <said>I believe, <persName>Mr. Orlando</persName>, I have given

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> bowed, and would have ſaid

            <p>The blood that had ſo often been the

            <p>Every thing ſeemed to depend on the
<lb/>preſence of mind which he was at this 
<lb/>moment able to exert. He recovered him­
          <lb/>ſelf, and ſaid, in a firm and calm tone, <said>I
<lb/>know not, Madam, what information you
<lb/>have received; but this I know, and do
<lb/>moſt ſolemnly aſſure you, that I have no

<lb/>ſtruck by a ſpeech which he believed re­
          <lb/>lated to <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſtood like a ſtatue. It
          <lb/>was fortunate for him that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,
          <lb/>after the words wicked girls, continued to
          <lb/>ſpeak; for, had ſhe not done ſo, <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>would infallibly have betrayed himſelf by

<lb/>he would indeed have confeſſed, without
<lb/>reſerve, their long attachment, and frequent
<lb/>interviews: but the reſt of her ſpeech, and the
          <lb/>entrance of <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, for whom ſhe
<lb/>rang juſt as ſhe concluded it, gave him
          <lb/>time to recollect himſelf: yet when <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, in her uſual way, diſmiſſed him,
<lb/>he doubted whether his honour and his 
<lb/>love did not call upon him to come to an
<lb/>immediate explanation. The conſideration
          <lb/>and kindneſs which <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> expreſſ­
<lb/>ed for him, ſo unlike the uſual prudiſh
<lb/>aſperity of her diſpoſition, were offenſive
<lb/>and hateful to him, when he believed ſhe
          <lb/>acquitted him at the expence of <persName>Monimia</persName>.
<lb/>He haſtened however to his own apartment,
<lb/>becauſe it was neceſſary to ſee what was
<lb/>become of his brother. It was ſome alle­
<lb/>viation to his confuſion and diſtreſs to find
          <lb/><persName>Philip</persName> was gone; and he ſat down, endea­
<lb/>vouring to collect his thoughts, and to de­
<lb/>termine on what was to be done.</p>
            <p>That <persName>Monimia</persName> was on his account to be
          <lb/>diſmiſſed from the houſe of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,

<lb/>and the protection of her only relation, the
<lb/>circumſtances of the preceding night, added
<lb/>to what he had juſt heard, left him but
<lb/>little reaſon to doubt. What then was to
<lb/>become of her? and how could he make
<lb/>her any reparation for the injury he had
<lb/>done her, but by inſtantly declaring the
<lb/>truth, and relinquiſhing all proſpect of fu­
<lb/>ture proſperity, from which ſhe muſt be ex­
<lb/>cluded?—Deſperate as he felt this ſtep to
<lb/>be, he was in a ſtate of mind that urged
<lb/>him to decide on any thing that might
<lb/>bring their fate to a criſis; and, believing
<lb/>himſelf finally determined, he ſtarted up
<lb/>from this ſhort counſel with himſelf, and
<lb/>was going haſtily to the apartment of
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, when at the door he was

<lb/>on the point of betraying. Senſible of his
<lb/>good fortune in having been thus prevent­

          <lb/><said>Whatever you know, <persName>Betty</persName>,</said> ſaid he,

            <p><said>As to <emph>her</emph> favour,</said> anſwered the girl
          <lb/>pertly, <said>I values it no more than that;
<lb/>and ſhe had better keep her tongue within
<lb/>her teeth about me, I can tell her that;
<lb/>and as for places, there's more in the
<lb/>world. One ſhould have a fine time on't,
<lb/>indeed, to paſs all one's life in this here old
<lb/>dungeon, among rats, and ghoſts, and old
<lb/>women. However, young 'Squire, I ad­
<lb/>viſes you, as a friend, to take more care
<lb/>for the future: ſome people are very ſly;
<lb/>but for my part I ſcorn to betray 'um—but
<lb/>mayhap the next houſemaid mid'nt be ſo will­
<lb/>ing as I have been to bear the blame for things
<lb/>ſhe's as innocent of as the child unborn.</said></p>
            <p><said>I cannot tell to what you allude,</said> re­

<lb/>this I know, that if I have done you any
<lb/>injury, I am very ſorry for it, and willing
<lb/>to make you any reparation in my power.</said>
<lb/>He then took a guinea from his pocket—
          <lb/><said>Accept of this,</said> cried he, <said>and be
<lb/>aſſured that I ſhall on any future occaſion be
<lb/>happy to ſerve you.</said>—The girl took the
<lb/>guinea, but without expreſſing any gratitude
<lb/>either for that, or his apparent wiſhes to
<lb/>make her what amends he could for the
<lb/>loſs of her place:—ſhe flippantly told him,
<lb/>ſhe hoped, for all Madam's injuſtice, and the
          <lb/>malice of her enemies, ſhe had <emph>frinds</emph> who
<lb/>would not let her be beholden to nobody—
<lb/>She then left the houſe.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, thus relieved from the moſt
<lb/>acute uneaſineſs he had ever ſuffered, re­
<lb/>turned to his room. He moſt ardently 
          <lb/>wiſhed to communicate to <persName>Monimia</persName> the
<lb/>joy he felt in finding that the ſuſpicions
<lb/>excited by ſo many awkward circumſtances,
<lb/>had by ſome means or other fallen upon
<lb/>this ſervant; and apparently without doing
<lb/>her any injury, which would have conſi­

<milestone unit="sig" n="N7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">277</mw>
<lb/>derably leſſened his ſatisfaction. Far from
<lb/>regretting her diſmiſſion, ſhe ſeemed pleaſed
<lb/>with having had an opportunity given her
          <lb/>to be diſmiſſed; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, who had
          <lb/>long known her to be a very improper aſ­
<lb/>ſociate for <persName>Monimia</persName>, found many reaſons
<lb/>to be glad of her departure. That ſhe 
<lb/>knew, or very ſtrongly ſuſpected their
<lb/>meetings, ſeemed very evident; ſhe was
<lb/>much leſs dangerous any where than within 
<lb/>the houſe—and as to what ſhe might ſay
<lb/>without, which might be prejudicial to the
          <lb/>character of <persName>Monimia</persName>, he determined to
<lb/>prevent the ill effects of that where it might
<lb/>be moſt prejudicial, by confeſſing, before
<lb/>he left the country, the very extent of his
<lb/>fault to his father, who already ſuſpected ſo
<lb/>much of the truth.</p>
            <p>However earneſtly he wiſhed to ſpeak to
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, and however uneaſy the idea of
<lb/>her ſuſpenſe and dejection made him, he
<lb/>could find no opportunity of ſpeaking to
<lb/>her during the morning, without hazard,
<lb/>which he had too recently ſuffered for, ſo

<pb n="2278"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">278</mw>
<lb/>immediately to incur again. Though
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had artfully made <persName>Betty</persName> the
<lb/>victim, there was ſtill reaſon to believe ſhe
<lb/>was not without ſuſpicions; and to irritate
<lb/>or increaſe them now, would be to pre­
<lb/>clude himſelf from the laſt pleaſure he was
<lb/>likely to taſte during the reſt of his ſhort
<lb/>reſidence at the Hall—the pleaſure of
          <lb/>ſoothing his beloved <persName>Monimia</persName>, and, at the
<lb/>few interviews which they might yet obtain,
<lb/>reconciling her ſoft heart to the neceſſity
<lb/>of that ſeparation that was ſo ſoon to 
<lb/>happen.</p>
            <p>He was ſummoned to dinner with <persName>Mrs. 
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, who ſeemed pleaſed to find he
<lb/>was ſtill at the Hall. Never did the old
<lb/>Lady appear in ſuch good humour with him,
<lb/>or ſo relaxed from the ſtarch prudery of
<lb/>her uſual character.—She gave way to her
<lb/>love of telling anecdotes and ſtories of her
<lb/>own family; and, pleaſed with the attention
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> gave to her narratives, ſhe hinted
<lb/>to him, though ſtill with great ambiguity,
<lb/>that it would be his own fault if he was not

<lb/>one day or other the repreſentative of a 
<lb/>family ſo illuſtrious. She then ſpoke of
<lb/>his elder brother with anger and con­
          <lb/>tempt, which <persName>Orlando</persName> generouſly tried to
<lb/>ſoften; of his mother with her uſual cold­
<lb/>neſs and diſlike; and of his ſiſters as good,
          <lb/>pretty-behaved girls—<said>that is, I mean,
            <lb/>the two youngeſt. As to <persName>Miſs Belle</persName>—ſhe's
            <lb/>a <placeName>London</placeName> lady already: I proteſt it hurts 
<lb/>me to ſee young women ſo bold—but ſhe 
<lb/>has been cried up for a beauty. 'Tis va­
<lb/>nity ruins all girls—no good is ever to be
<lb/>expected from them when once they get
<lb/>conceited notions into their heads of being
<lb/>handſome.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> undertook the defence of his
<lb/>ſiſter with more zeal than prudence; but
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, though not to be convinced
          <lb/>that <persName>Iſabella</persName> was not a vain coquet, which
<lb/>indeed her unguarded gaiety gave the old
<lb/>Lady very good reaſon to believe, was how­
<lb/>ever in a humour to be pleaſed with all
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> ſaid. Her attachment to him had
<lb/>been long inſenſibly increaſing; and though,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">like</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">280</mw>
          <lb/>like another <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, ſhe could not bear
<lb/>openly to acknowledge her ſucceſſor, ſhe
<lb/>was as little proof as the royal ancient vir­
<lb/>gin, againſt the attractions of an amiable
<lb/>and handſome young man, whom ſhe loved
<lb/>to conſider as the child of her bounty, and
<lb/>the creature of her ſmiles. Though deter­
<lb/>mined to keep him dependent during her
<lb/>life, and even to ſend him out a ſoldier of
<lb/>fortune, ſhe really meant to give him, at
<lb/>her death, the whole of her landed pro­
          <lb/>perty; and the machinations of <persName>Pattenſon</persName>,
<lb/>whoſe jealouſy and avarice alike excited his
          <lb/>hatred to <persName>Orlando</persName>, had hitherto had an ef­
<lb/>fect ſo different from what he expected, that
<lb/>he found his politics entirely baffled, and
<lb/>more likely to loſe, by farther attempts, his
<lb/>Lady's regard, that to ſhake that ſhe enter­
<lb/>tained for the young favourite.</p>
            <p>A few years before, the very ſuſpicion of
<lb/>an intrigue would have ſhut for ever the
          <lb/>doors of <placeName>Rayland Hall</placeName> againſt the ſuppoſed
<lb/>delinquent; but now the attempts to impute
          <lb/>ſuch to <persName>Orlando</persName> had ended in nothing but
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">the</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">281</mw>
<lb/>the diſmiſſing a ſervant—a circumſtance
<lb/>proving at once, that though ſome credit
<lb/>was given to the accuſation, no reſentment
<lb/>towards him was entertained.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, who had more ſenſe and
          <lb/>more art than <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, and who had op­
<lb/>portunities more cloſely to obſerve her Lady,
<lb/>had long ſeen the progreſs of her affection
          <lb/>for <persName>Orlando</persName>, and long ceaſed to counteract
<lb/>it.—She was not weak enough to imagine,
          <lb/>as <persName>Pattenſon</persName> did, that ſuch great property
          <lb/>as <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> poſſeſſed would be di­
<lb/>vided among her ſervants—but ſhe knew 
<lb/>that ſhe ſhould herſelf poſſeſs a very con­
<lb/>ſiderable legacy; and ſhe thought it better
          <lb/>that <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhould poſſeſs the bulk of the
<lb/>fortune, than either his father, who had al­
<lb/>ways conſidered the old ſervants about her 
<lb/>as his enemies, or any public charity—to
          <lb/>ſome of which <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had, in
<lb/>former fits of ill humour, expreſſed an in­
          <lb/>tention to leave the Rayland eſtate.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had, in common with
<lb/>many old people, a ſtrange averſion to
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſpeaking</mw>
<pb n="2282"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">282</mw>
<lb/>ſpeaking of her will, or of what was to
<lb/>happen after her death; and, far advanced
<lb/>as ſhe was in life, ſhe ſpoke of future years
          <lb/>as if ſhe believed herſelf immortal. <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName> had, however, once ſeen part of a 
<lb/>will—with which, in reſpect to herſelf, ſhe
<lb/>had great reaſon to be ſatisfied. She knew
          <lb/>that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had lately made an­
<lb/>other, to which ſhe was not a witneſs;—for
<lb/>ſuch was the peculiarity of her Lady in this
<lb/>reſpect, that ſhe had ſent for a lawyer and
          <lb/>witneſſes from <placeName>London</placeName>, that none of the
<lb/>neighbouring attorneys, or even her con­
<lb/>fidential ſervants, might know its contents.
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> did not doubt but that <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> was in this made the heir of almoſt 
<lb/>all the landed property; but ſhe had no 
          <lb/>reaſon, from <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> behaviour to
<lb/>her, to apprehend that this new will was
<lb/>at all prejudicial to herſelf.</p>
            <p>Still, however, it was not her intereſt to
<lb/>encourage the affection which many cir­
          <lb/>cumſtances gave her reaſon to believe <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> entertained for her niece. She knew

<lb/>that, if the raſhneſs of youth and paſſion
<lb/>ſhould urge them to marry, it would not
          <lb/>only ruin <persName>Orlando</persName>, who would then be a
<lb/>beggar; but that ſhe ſhould herſelf be
<lb/>accuſed of having promoted this fatal in­
<lb/>diſcretion, and loſe her own advantages
<lb/>without obtaining any for her niece, whom
<lb/>ſhe by no means wiſhed to ſee independent
<lb/>of her, even if independence could thus
<lb/>have been obtained; and whom ſhe treated 
<lb/>with redoubled rigour, when ſhe found
          <lb/>reaſon to believe that <persName>Orlando</persName> felt for her
<lb/>that attachment which ſhe had from their 
<lb/>childhood foreſeen and attempted to pre­
<lb/>vent.</p>
            <p>The more <persName>Orlando</persName> gained on the fa­
          <lb/>vour of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, the more appre­
          <lb/>henſive <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> became of his af­
          <lb/>fection for <persName>Monimia</persName>: ſhe had however
<lb/>perſuaded herſelf, that, with the precautions
<lb/>ſhe took, their clandeſtinely meeting or
<lb/>carrying on any correſpondence was im­
          <lb/>practicable; and, ſatisfied that <persName>Monimia</persName> was

<lb/>now and then ſlumbered. But it awak­
<lb/>ened by the late reports that obtained in
<lb/>the houſe and about the country; reports
          <lb/>which originated in the goſſip of <persName>Orlando's</persName>
<lb/>nocturnal viſitor; of his being miſſing at 
          <lb/>unuſual hours, and from <persName>Betty's</persName> hints.

<lb/>the behaviour of <persName>Philip</persName>, and who ſaw, with
<lb/>inexpreſſible anguiſh, the ravage which the
<lb/>uneaſineſs ariſing from that ſource was
<lb/>hourly making on the conſtitution of her 
<lb/>huſband, had been fondly flattering herſelf,
<lb/>during the firſt weeks of the General's viſit, 
          <lb/>that in him <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> had found a 
<lb/>ſincere friend, and their children a powerful 
<lb/>protector. The ſolicitude he expreſſed for
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, and the conſideration with which
          <lb/>he treated <persName>Philip</persName>, made her ſanguinely

<lb/>rous friend, was ſuddenly ſtruck with the

<lb/>might have given meaning to his expreſ­
<lb/>ſions which they were never meant to con­
          <lb/>vey; but, upon queſtioning her and <persName>Selina</persName>

<lb/>repeatedly, and from the obſervations ſhe
<lb/>made the following days, ſhe was con­
<lb/>vinced that their repreſentations of his be­
<lb/>haviour were juſt. This cruel certainty ſhe
<lb/>determined however to conceal from her
<lb/>huſband, and to guard, by her own pru­
<lb/>dent watchfulneſs, againſt the artifices of
<lb/>the General, without bringing on a rupture
          <lb/>between him and <persName>Somerive</persName>, that might be 
<lb/>attended with conſequences ſhe ſickened to
<lb/>think of.</p>
            <p>The General, however, who paid her the
<lb/>moſt aſſiduous court, was ſoon ſenſible of
<lb/>a change in her manners; for ſhe was inca­
<lb/>pable of the diſſimulation which people of
<lb/>the world ſo ſucceſsfully practiſe. From
          <lb/>hence, and from the behaviour of <persName>Iſabella</persName>,
<lb/>the General found that a longer ſtay would
<lb/>betray his inſidious deſigns without con­
<lb/>tributing at all to their succeſs, and he pre­
<lb/>pared to go; yet could not bear to relin­
          <lb/>quiſh for ever his hopes of gaining <persName>Iſabella</persName>,
<lb/>with whom he was more in love than ever.
<lb/>He lingered, therefore, notwithſtanding all

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">289</mw>
          <lb/>the diſcouragement he received; and <persName>Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, who believed him the beſt and moſt
<lb/>ſincere friend that ever man had, commu­
<lb/>nicated to him all his affairs, and all his
<lb/>anxiety—by which the General perceived
<lb/>plainly, he was in ſuch a ſtate of mind as
<lb/>muſt haſten him to the grave; and he had
<lb/>learned that, impreſſed with ideas of his
<lb/>(the General's) friendſhip for all his family,
<lb/>he had made him executor, and truſted the
<lb/>welfare of his wife and daughters entirely
          <lb/>to him and to <persName>Orlando</persName>.</p>
            <p>Though <persName>Tracy</persName> therefore could neither
<lb/>give up his purſuit, nor ſucceed in it at pre­
<lb/>ſent, he believed that the death of the
<lb/>father, the indigence to which the whole
<lb/>family would be reduced, and the abſence
          <lb/>of <persName>Orlando</persName>, would together make eaſy the
          <lb/>project of obtaining <persName>Iſabella</persName> for a miſtreſs;
<lb/>and that patience and diſſimulation alone
<lb/>were neceſſary to keep up his influence in
<lb/>the family, till they ſhould be wholly in
<lb/>his power. He determined, therefore, to
<lb/>check himſelf; to make no more profeſ­

<lb/>ſions with which <persName>Iſabella</persName> could be offended,
<lb/>but to expreſs his contrition that he had
<lb/>ſaid what ſhe conſtrued into want of re­
<lb/>ſpect; to hint remotely at honourable in­
<lb/>tentions; and thus, without engaging him­
<lb/>ſelf, or, as the faſhionable phraſe is, com­
<lb/>mitting himſelf, to retain his influence over
<lb/>the whole family, as well as over the father;
<lb/>and to be aſſured that, whenever he choſe
<lb/>to return, he ſhould be received with plea­
          <lb/>ſure. As to any ſuſpicion that <persName>Iſabella</persName> might
<lb/>think him of an age ſo diſproportionate
<lb/>as to hear even his honourable offers with
<lb/>diſdain and ridicule, it never occurred to
<lb/>the General; and he was pretty well aſſured,
<lb/>from the pecuniary circumſtances of the
<lb/>family, that every other member of it would
<lb/>receive the remoteſt hint of an intended
<lb/>alliance with tranſport. The behaviour
          <lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, on the evening of the
          <lb/>tenant's ball, convinced him that <persName>Iſabella</persName>
<lb/>had not merely threatened when ſhe pro­

          <lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, whenever he talked of
<lb/>going, preſſed his ſtay, it was time to 
<lb/>depart.</p>
            <p>The meſſenger, who was ſent to the
<lb/>poſt town on the following evening for
          <lb/>letters, brought to <persName>General Tracy</persName> a large
<lb/>pacquet, arrived that day by the ſtage.
<lb/>On opening it, it was found to contain the
          <lb/>commiſſion of an enſign for <persName>Orlando Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, executed in due form, from the
          <lb/><orgName>War Office</orgName>. This he haſtened to offer,
          <lb/>with a ſtudied ſpeech, to <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>;
<lb/>who had hardly recovered from the emo­
<lb/>tions with which the ſight of it, and his
<lb/>peculiar and ſtudied manner of preſenting
          <lb/>it, occaſioned, when <persName>Orlando</persName>, anxious to
<lb/>know at what time his brother had got 
<lb/>home, and how his mother and ſiſters were
<lb/>after the fatigue and uneaſineſs of the night
<lb/>before, arrived.</p>
            <p>On his firſt entrance, he enquired eagerly
          <lb/>after his brother.—<said>Your brother!</said> cried

<lb/>night:—believing he was with you, and
<lb/>indeed ſuppoſing it poſſible that he was
<lb/>not well enough to leave your apartment,
<lb/>I made myſelf tolerably eaſy about him.—
<lb/>But when did he leave you? and where is
<lb/>he now?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> replied, that he had left his bed
<lb/>about eleven o'clock; and then, to quiet the
<lb/>uneaſineſs which he ſaw this unexpected
          <lb/>abſence gave to them all, he added, <said>But 
            <lb/>he is gone, I dare ſay, to <persName>Mr. Stockton's</persName>,
<lb/>where he has talked ſome time of intending
<lb/>to paſs a day or two, and probably will
<lb/>not return home till to-morrow or next
<lb/>day.</said></p>
            <p><said>Gone to <persName>Mr. Stockton's</persName>!</said> exclaimed
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>—<said>What! without linen or
<lb/>change of clothes, though there is an houſe
<lb/>full of company?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, who ſaw how much his 
<lb/>wife was alarmed and affected, endeavour­
<lb/>ed to ſpeak lightly of the abſence of her
          <lb/>ſon—<said>You know, my love,</said> ſaid he,

            <lb/>being a beau; and that the party at <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Stockton's</persName> are only men. He can probably
<lb/>borrow any linen he wants of his friends; and,
<lb/>as he means to be at home ſo ſoon, and
<lb/>has no ſervant with him, perhaps preferred
<lb/>doing ſo to the trouble of ſending home for
            <lb/>his own.</said> <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> ſighed, and caſt
<lb/>a deſponding look on her huſband, who
          <lb/>added, <said>But, come, my dear <persName>Bella</persName>, you
            <lb/>and I have ſomething to ſay to <persName>Orlando</persName>—
<lb/>we will go all together into my ſtudy for
<lb/>a few moments, and the girls will have tea
<lb/>ready againſt our return.</said>—So ſaying, he
          <lb/>took his wife's hand, and, <persName>Orlando</persName> follow­
<lb/>ing them, they left the room.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> was no ſooner releaſed 
<lb/>from the reſtraint which the preſence of
<lb/>the General impoſed, than ſhe threw herſelf 
<lb/>into a chair, and fell into an agony of tears.
<lb/>Her huſband gently chid her for emotion
<lb/>which he endeavoured to perſuade her was
<lb/>much beyond the occaſion; and, having
<lb/>ſucceeded in rendering her ſomewhat more
          <lb/>calm, he told <persName>Orlando</persName> that his commiſſion

<lb/>was arrived, and enquired whether any con­
<lb/>verſation had paſſed between him and
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> in conſequence of what had
          <lb/>been held between her and <persName>General Tracy</persName> 
          <lb/>the preceding evening? <persName>Orlando</persName> related it
<lb/>all as nearly as he could recollect it, ſave
<lb/>only that ſentence which related to ſome
          <lb/>fancied attachment; and <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>
<lb/>received, with great pleaſure, what appeared
<lb/>to him equal to a confirmation of the moſt
<lb/>ſanguine hopes he had ever entertained on
          <lb/>his ſon's behalf.—<persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> however
<lb/>was leſs elated: ſhe could not comprehend
          <lb/>how <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, if ſhe had ſo much
<lb/>affection for <persName>Orlando</persName>, could not only bear 
<lb/>to part with him, but promote his depar­
<lb/>ture; or how, if ſhe meant to make him
<lb/>her heir, ſhe could determine to ſend him
<lb/>out in the world a ſoldier of fortune. The
<lb/>repreſentations of her huſband, however, 
          <lb/>and the content which <persName>Orlando</persName> expreſſed,
<lb/>reconciled her by degrees to what ſhe
<lb/>could not now recall. She gave him, but
<lb/>not without many tears, the commiſſion

          <lb/>with which <persName>General Tracy</persName> had juſt pre
<lb/>ſented her—but as ſhe tried to give him
<lb/>her bleſſing with it, ſhe relapſed into con­
          <lb/>vulſive ſorrow. <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> found it
<lb/>would only diſtreſs her to return to the 
          <lb/>parlour; he therefore bade <persName>Orlando</persName> lead his
<lb/>mother to her own room, while he, return­
<lb/>ing to where his daughters were ſitting with
          <lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName>, bade them go to her, and
<lb/>ſend their brother down to the parlour.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, on his entrance, addreſſed him­
          <lb/>ſelf to <persName>Tracy</persName>, whom he thanked in the moſt
<lb/>graceful terms. The General anſwered his 
<lb/>compliment with politeneſs, and the three
<lb/>gentlemen then began to diſcourſe of the
          <lb/>departure of <persName>Orlando</persName> for that party of his
          <lb/>regiment that were in <placeName>England</placeName>, which
          <lb/><persName>Tracy</persName> told him could not properly be de­
<lb/>ferred longer than till the following week.
          <lb/>He adviſed therefore that <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhould
          <lb/>ſet out for <placeName>London</placeName> on the following <name>Mon­

<lb/>that the General was to leave him ſo ſoon
<lb/>(though his ſtay had been prolonged to

<lb/>equipment of <persName>Orlando</persName>, of which <persName>Mrs. 
<lb/>Rayland</persName> was, he underſtood, to defray the
<lb/>expence, the directions of ſuch a friend
<lb/>could not fail of being extremely uſeful,

<lb/>ſiſters for the night, he ſet out on foot to
<lb/>return to the Hall.</p>
            <p>The night was overcaſt and gloomy;
<lb/>chill and hollow the wind whiſtled among
<lb/>the leafleſs trees, or groaned amid the
<lb/>thick firs in the dark and ſilent wood;—
<lb/>the water falls murmured hollow in the
<lb/>blaſt, and only the owl's cry broke thoſe
<lb/>dull and melancholy ſounds, which ſeemed
          <lb/>to ſay—<said><persName>Orlando</persName>, you will reviſit theſe
<lb/>ſcenes no more!</said> He endeavoured to rea­
<lb/>ſon himſelf out of theſe comfortleſs pre­
<lb/>ſages. He tried to figure to himſelf the
<lb/>happier days, that never ſeemed ſo likely
<lb/>as now to be his, and at no very remote
          <lb/>period. Though <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was, from
<lb/>peculiarity of temper, averſe to naming her
<lb/>ſucceſſor, ſhe was not at all likely to hold
<lb/>out hopes ſhe never meant to realize, and
<lb/>certainly ſhe never gave any ſo ſtrong as
<lb/>what her converſation of that morning had 
<lb/>offered. He endeavoured therefore to per­
<lb/>ſuade himſelf, that the time was not very
<lb/>far diſtant when, if he was not actually the

<lb/>leaſt have ſuch a competency as ſhould
<lb/>enable him to ſettle in this native coun­
          <lb/>try with his beloved <persName>Monimia</persName>. He tried
<lb/>to animate his drooping ſpirits with the
<lb/>idea that, in the profeſſion into which he
<lb/>was now entering, he might find the means
<lb/>of accelerating this happy period. But
<lb/>then the frightful interval that muſt inter­
<lb/>vene occurred to him, with all the poſſi­
<lb/>bilities that might happen in it; and the 
          <lb/>deſtitute ſtate of <persName>Monimia</persName>, the ill health
<lb/>of his father (which, though he did not
<lb/>complain, was viſible to every body), the
<lb/>unhappy miſconduct of his brother, threat­
<lb/>ening the ruin and diſperſion of his family,
          <lb/>and the poſſibility that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> might
<lb/>diſappoint the expectations ſhe had raiſed,
<lb/>all combined to ſink and depreſs him, and
<lb/>again to lend to the well-known paths he
<lb/>was traverſing, horrors not their own, while
          <lb/>every object repeated—<said><persName>Orlando</persName> will re­

            <p>By the time he reached that part of the

<milestone unit="sig" n="O7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">301</mw>
<lb/>park from whence the houſe was viſible at
<lb/>a diſtance, it was quite dark, and, had he
<lb/>not almoſt inſtinctively known his way, he
<lb/>could not have diſcerned it—for no light
<lb/>glimmered from the Gothic windows of the
<lb/>Hall, not even in that part of the houſe 
          <lb/>inhabited by the ſervants; and <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>imagined that moſt of them, fatigued the
<lb/>night before, were gone earlier than uſual
<lb/>to bed. He fixed his eyes earneſtly on
          <lb/><persName>Monimia's</persName> turret:—all was dark; and he
<lb/>doubted whether her aunt had not removed
<lb/>her, in conſequence of the ſuſpicions that
<lb/>originated in the circumſtances of the pre­
<lb/>ceding evening. This apprehenſion made
<lb/>his ſpirits ſink ſtill more heavily; and when
<lb/>he was within an hundred yards of the
<lb/>houſe, he ſtopped, and gazed mournfully
<lb/>on the place, which perhaps no longer con­
<lb/>tained the object of his affection.</p>
            <p>There is hardly a ſenſation more painful
<lb/>than the blank that ſtrikes on the heart,
<lb/>when, inſtead of the light we expect ſtream­
<lb/>ing from ſome beloved ſpot where our

<lb/>affections are fondly fixed, all is ſilent and
<lb/>dark.—Ah! how often in life we feel this
<lb/>yet ſtronger, when the friend on whom we
<lb/>rely becomes ſuddenly cold and repulſive!
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, who was paſſionately fond of poe­

            <p>Quiet as every thing appeared round the

          <lb/>when <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> uſually locked the door
          <lb/>of <persName>Monimia's</persName> apartment for the night; it

          <lb/>her niece in her own room longer than

            <p>It was indeed ſo very dark that he was
<lb/>ſure it was impoſſible for any one to diſcern
<lb/>him from the houſe, or at leaſt to diſtinguiſh
<lb/>his figure from that of the deer who were 
<lb/>feeding around him. He ſat down there­
<lb/>fore on the turf; but the dreary moments
<lb/>paſſed, and ſtill no light appeared—though
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> was ſure that if a light was in the
<lb/>room he muſt ſee it, becauſe of the want of
<lb/>ſhutters towards the upper part of this long
<lb/>window. A thouſand conjectures diſturbed 
<lb/>him, and grew, as time wore away, more 
          <lb/>and more painful. Perhaps <persName>Monimia</persName> was
<lb/>indiſpoſed, and had gone early to bed; 
<lb/>perhaps the alarms ſhe had ſuffered the
<lb/>preceding evening, and uneaſineſs at his
<lb/>not having ſeen her, might have overcome
<lb/>her tender ſpirits, and, together with the
<lb/>harſh reproaches of her aunt, have rendered
<lb/>her really ill. His warm and rapid imagi­
<lb/>nation now repreſented her ſinking under
<lb/>anguiſh of mind which ſhe dared not com­
<lb/>municate—and tenderly reproaching him 
<lb/>for being the cauſe of all her ſufferings. It
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">was</mw>
<pb n="2304"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">304</mw>
<lb/>was he who had diſturbed the innocent ſe­
<lb/>renity of her boſom—and perſuaded her to
<lb/>grant him interviews, with which ſhe con­
<lb/>tinually reproached herſelf. Or, if this was
<lb/>not the caſe, if her lovely frame was not
<lb/>overwhelmed by ſickneſs ariſing from
<lb/>ſorrow, perhaps ſhe was more ſtrictly con­
<lb/>fined in ſome part of the houſe where it
<lb/>would be impoſſible for him to ſee her; 
<lb/>from whence it would be equally impoſſible
<lb/>for her to eſcape to him, to indulge him in the
<lb/>laſt ſad pleaſure of a parting interview. This
<lb/>laſt conjecture appeared highly probable,
          <lb/>from what <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had ſaid to him
<lb/>in the morning; and he found it too intole­
<lb/>rable, even while it was but conjecture, to
<lb/>be ſupported with patience. The great
<lb/>clock now ſtruck eleven: every vibration
<lb/>ſeemed to fall on his heart.—He traverſed
<lb/>yet a little longer the turf immediately 
<lb/>under the windows of the turret; and at 
<lb/>length ſaw a light from the ſervants' hall,
<lb/>whither he went, hoping, yet fearing, to gain
<lb/>ſome intelligence which he dreaded to aſk.

          <lb/>He entered, however; but found only <persName>Pat­
<lb/>tenſon</persName> there, who was putting out the fire.
          <lb/>It was in vain <persName>Orlando</persName> addreſſed him with
<lb/>great civility. The ſulky old butler, who
<lb/>imputed to him the alacrity with which his 
<lb/>favourite nymph had left the houſe, looked
<lb/>at him with a countenance cloudy and in­
<lb/>dignant, and deigned not even to give him
          <lb/>the candle he aſked for.—<said>There are
<lb/>candles, if you want them!</said> was all he 
          <lb/>could obtain from him. He enquired if <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName> was gone to her room? if he could 
          <lb/>ſpeak to <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>? To which <persName>Patten­
            <lb/>ſon</persName>, turning ſullenly away, replied, <said>The
<lb/>women's ſide of the houſe has been ſhut up
<lb/>theſe two hours—you'll hardly get any ad­
<lb/>mittance to make your ſlummering ſpeeches
            <lb/>to any on 'em to-night.</said>—<persName>Orlando</persName>, al­
<lb/>ready irritated by vexation, was ſo much
<lb/>provoked at this inſolence, that he was
<lb/>tempted to knock down the conſequential
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Pattenſon</persName>; but he fortunately recollect­
<lb/>ed that he was an old man, and a ſervant,
<lb/>and that it was unworthy of him to ſtrike
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſuch</mw>
<pb n="2306"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">306</mw>
<lb/>ſuch a perſon, whatever might be the pro­
<lb/>vocation. He could not however help ex­
<lb/>preſſing his anger for this inſult, in terms
<lb/>ſtronger than he uſually allowed himſelf;
<lb/>and then, half frantic, went to his own 
<lb/>room, merely becauſe he knew not what to
          <lb/>do to obtain ſome intelligence of <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>.</p>
            <p>After a moment's conſideration, he went
<lb/>through the chapel, and to the lower room
          <lb/>of the turret. If <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had diſ­
<lb/>covered the door of communication, he
<lb/>thought he ſhould perceive it by ſome
<lb/>means or other—but all below was as he left
<lb/>it:—he then mounted the ſtairs, and liſten­
          <lb/>ed at the door behind <persName>Monimia's</persName> bed, but
<lb/>all was profoundly ſilent. He then ven­
<lb/>tured to tap ſoftly at the door, their uſual
          <lb/>ſignal, which <persName>Monimia</persName> never failed, when
<lb/>ſhe was alone, to anſwer inſtantly; but
<lb/>now no anſwer was returned. He ſpoke—
<lb/>but no ſoft voice, in tremulous whiſpers,
<lb/>replied. Again he rapped, and ſpoke 
<lb/>louder; but ſtill all was dead ſilence around
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">him.</mw>

<lb/>him.—Yet he waited a moment or two—
          <lb/>loſt in diſtracting conjectures—<persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>was certainly not in her room—what then
<lb/>was become of her, or whither was ſhe 
<lb/>gone? He felt as if he ſhould never ſee 
<lb/>her more, though it was impoſſible to ſup­
<lb/>poſe ſhe was removed from the houſe. At
<lb/>length he returned to his own apartment
<lb/>again, more wretched than he left it;—and
<lb/>not ſeeing any probability of diſcovering
<lb/>that night what could thus have robbed him
          <lb/>of the ſight of <persName>Monimia</persName>, he went to his
<lb/>bed—but not to ſleep, though he had ſuf­
<lb/>fered ſo many hours of mental and bodily
<lb/>fatigue. He watched the earlieſt dawn of
<lb/>light; and as ſoon as he could diſcern the
<lb/>objects about the park, he dreſſed himſelf
<lb/>and went out—walking ſlowly round the 
<lb/>houſe, and looking up at all the windows,
          <lb/>in hopes that if <persName>Monimia</persName> was as reſtleſs as
<lb/>he was, ſhe might appear at that of the
<lb/>room ſhe was confined in, in the expectation
<lb/>of ſeeing him. But he made his melan­
<lb/>choly tour repeatedly in vain. He then

<lb/>returned to his own room, furniſhed him­
<lb/>ſelf with materials for ſhooting, and then
<lb/>went into the kitchen under pretence of
<lb/>drying ſome powder; that, while he watch­
<lb/>ed it carefully himſelf, he might have
<lb/>pretence for ſtaying to talk a little
<lb/>with the cook. This woman, whoſe ad­
          <lb/>miration of <persName>Orlando's</persName> beauty had made
<lb/>her much his friend, was willing enough
<lb/>to goſſip with him, and talked much of 
          <lb/><persName>Betty's</persName> being ſo ſuddenly diſcharged, de­
<lb/>claimed againſt her, and hinted that it was
<lb/>pity ſuch a young 'ſquire ſhould under­
<lb/>value himſelf ſo as to take a liking to ſuch
          <lb/>a tawdry trollop.—<persName>Orlando</persName>, who cared
<lb/>very little what was thought of him in

<lb/>denied the oblique charge; but endeavour­
          <lb/>ed to lead the converſation towards <persName>Mrs.

            <p>This was ſaid merely at random; but
          <lb/><persName>Orlando's</persName> confuſion was evident. He
          <lb/>found that whatever removal <persName>Mrs. Len­

<lb/>niece, ſhe had not communicated her in­
<lb/>tentions, or the motives of them, to this
<lb/>ſervant, and probably not to any of the
<lb/>others.—His diſtracting ſuſpenſe was now
<lb/>almoſt inſupportable. He had promiſed
          <lb/>his father to enquire after <persName>Philip</persName>; he was
          <lb/>under the neceſſity of ſeeing <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName>; and muſt paſs ſome part of the day 
<lb/>with his family. This circumſtanced, it
<lb/>was impoſſible, unleſs he gained ſome im­
          <lb/>mediate intelligence of <persName>Monimia</persName>, that he
<lb/>could acquaint her with the deciſion made
<lb/>in the courſe of the preceding day in re­
          <lb/>gard to his departure for <placeName>London</placeName>—im­
<lb/>poſſible to contrive a meeting, on which
<lb/>his hopes had ſo long dwelt, when he might

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">311</mw>
<lb/>reconcile her to his going, and offer her
<lb/>thoſe vows of everlaſting attachment which
<lb/>he meant moſt religiouſly to keep. It now
<lb/>occurred to him, that he would take his
<lb/>gun, and fire it on that ſide of the houſe
          <lb/>that was next <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> apartment,
          <lb/>in hopes that <persName>Monimia</persName> might come to the
<lb/>window for the chance of ſeeing if it was
<lb/>he who fired.—Retiring therefore haſtily 
<lb/>from the kitchen, without ſeeming to at­
<lb/>tend to the raillery of the ſervant with
<lb/>whom he had been talking, he ſaid there
<lb/>was a hawk about the park, which he had
<lb/>ſeen early that morning ſtrike a young
<lb/>hare; and that he would endeavour to
<lb/>ſhoot it. He went then almoſt under the 
          <lb/>windows of <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> room, and fired
<lb/>repeatedly, without obtaining what he wiſh­
<lb/>ed for. At length he ſaw through the caſe­
          <lb/>ment the figure of <persName>Monimia</persName>. He claſped
<lb/>his hands together, as if to entreat her ſtay,
<lb/>and to expreſs the anguiſh he laboured
<lb/>under. She looked fearfully behind her, as

<lb/>to him to approach. He flew under the
<lb/>window—ſhe opened the caſement, and
<lb/>ſaid, while fear made her voice almoſt in­
          <lb/>articulate, <said>My aunt ſuſpects us, and

            <p><said>I dare not ſtay,</said> cried the trembling

<lb/>She then ſhut the window; and <persName>Orlando</persName>,

<lb/>traction of his countenance ſtruck one of
<lb/>the under keepers, who, believing he was

<lb/>there was three or four of us of the Hall,
            <lb/>and <persName>John Dutton</persName> and <persName>Richard Williams</persName> 
            <lb/>at <placeName>Mill</placeName>, and <persName>Stokes</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName>, and ſome

<lb/>I will tear the ſoul out of any raſcal, who

          <lb/>was thunderſtruck by the violence of <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName>, <said>Lord, I was ſpeaking of Betty—
<lb/>ſhe as went away this morning becauſe of
<lb/>your keeping company with her—I'm ſure,
            <lb/>Sir, I never thought no harm of <persName>Miſs Mo­
<lb/>nimmy</persName>, nor ſcarce ever ſee her twice in 
<lb/>my life.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> now repented him of his raſh­
          <lb/>neſs.—<said>Well, well,</said> ſaid he—<said>I believe
            <lb/>you, <persName>Jacob</persName>—I'm ſure you would not ſay or
<lb/>think any harm of an innocent young lady,
            <lb/>eſpecially, <persName>Jacob</persName>, if you thought it would
<lb/>diſpleaſe me, and do me a great deal of
            <lb/>harm.</said>—<persName>Jacob</persName> now moſt earneſtly pro­
<lb/>teſted not only his unwillingneſs to offend, 
<lb/>but his deſire to oblige his honour.――
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe ſpirits were yet in ſuch a
<lb/>tumult, that he could not arrange the ideas
          <lb/>that crowded on his mind, now bade <persName>Jacob</persName>
<lb/>follow him into his ſtudy. Unwilling as
          <lb/>he had always been to put <persName>Monimia</persName> into
<lb/>the power of ſervants, he knew that ſome­
<lb/>thing deciſive muſt be hazarded, or that
<lb/>he muſt reſign all hopes of ſeeing her be­

<lb/>fore he went: he was the leſs ſcrupulous,
<lb/>as he was ſo ſoon to go, and he hoped he
<lb/>could make it this young man's intereſt to
<lb/>be faithful to him.—It occurred to him,
<lb/>that even when he was gone, ſome perſon
<lb/>muſt be in his confidence, who would re­
          <lb/>ceive, and deliver to <persName>Monimia</persName>, the letters
<lb/>which he knew he dared not direct to her
<lb/>at the Hall. This miſtake therefore, which
<lb/>had for a moment vexed and confuſed him,
<lb/>he now thought a fortunate circumſtance,
<lb/>and, without farther reflection, diſcloſed to
          <lb/>this young man his long affection for <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>; the difficulties he was in at the pre­
<lb/>ſent moment about ſeeing her; and his
<lb/>wiſh to find ſome means of correſponding 
          <lb/>with her hereafter. <persName>Jacob</persName> entered into his
<lb/>ſituation with an appearance of intelligence
          <lb/>and intereſt with which <persName>Orlando</persName> was well
<lb/>ſatisfied. They agreed upon a plan for
          <lb/>the evening—by which <persName>Orlando</persName> hoped to
          <lb/>procure an interview with <persName>Monimia</persName>, in­
<lb/>ſtead of merely ſeeing her at the window;
<lb/>and elated with this hope, he forgot the
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">hazard</mw>
<pb n="2317"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">317</mw>
<lb/>hazard and impropriety of the means he
<lb/>had uſed to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Having however talked over and ſettled
<lb/>every thing with his new confident, he
          <lb/>went to pay his compliments to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, to whom he reported the arrival
<lb/>of his commiſſion, and whom he found in
<lb/>the ſame diſpoſition as when he laſt ſaw
<lb/>her—Then having obtained her leave to
<lb/>dine at his father's, he ſet out in purſuit of
<lb/>his brother, in hopes of carrying ſome in­
<lb/>telligence to his family that might diſſi­
<lb/>pate their uneaſineſs, of which his own did
<lb/>not render him unmindful. He rode there­
          <lb/>fore to <persName>Mr. Stockton's</persName>, where he learned
          <lb/>from the ſervants, that <persName>Mr. Philip Some­
<lb/>rive</persName> had been there about one o'clock;
<lb/>that he had borrowed linen of their maſter,
<lb/>with whom he ſtaid till after a late dinner,
<lb/>and then had ſet out in a poſt-chaiſe, as
          <lb/>he ſaid, for <placeName>London</placeName>. This was informa­
<lb/>tion but little likely to quiet the uneaſineſs
<lb/>of his father and his family—with a heavy
          <lb/>heart, therefore, <persName>Orlando</persName> proceeded to give
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">it.</mw>

          <lb/>it. <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> received it with a deep
<lb/>ſigh, but without any comment; his wife
<lb/>with tears; while the General, from whom
<lb/>they concealed nothing, endeavoured to
          <lb/>conſole them by making light of it. <said>I
            <lb/>am perſuaded,</said> ſaid he, <said>my good friends,
<lb/>that your extreme ſolicitude and anxiety
<lb/>for your children often carry you beyond
<lb/>the line that diſpaſſionate reaſon would
<lb/>mark for your conduct towards them.</said>—
<lb/>Then addreſſing himſelf in his inſinuating
          <lb/>way to <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, he added—<said>For
<lb/>example, now, my dear good friend—you
<lb/>no ſooner hear that it is right for you to
<lb/>part with your younger ſon for the army,
<lb/>than you imagine that he will be killed.
<lb/>No ſooner is you elder miſſing upon one
<lb/>of thoſe little excurſions, which a young man
<lb/>of high ſpirit, without any preſent employ­
<lb/>ment, very naturally indulges himſelf in,
<lb/>than you figure to yourſelf I know not
            <lb/>what evil conſequence. Believe me, <persName>Or­

            <lb/>ed by the <name>Philiſtines</name>. Make yourſelves
<lb/>eaſy, therefore, I beg of you. Your ſon
            <lb/>is gone to <placeName>London</placeName> for four or five days
<lb/>perhaps—what then?—Here is your other
<lb/>ſon going with me—and we will make it
            <lb/>our buſineſs to ſee <persName>Philip</persName>, if you will but
<lb/>make yourſelves eaſy—and I dare ſay you
<lb/>will have him with you again, before you 
<lb/>eat your Chriſtmas dinner, ſafe and ſound.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, who ſaw from ſad expe­
          <lb/>rience the departure of <persName>Philip</persName> in a very
<lb/>different light, would not however dwell
<lb/>longer on a ſubject ſo affecting and ſo
<lb/>uſeleſs. It was no avail to diſcuſs now the 
<lb/>reaſons he had to dread the conduct of his 
<lb/>eldeſt ſon, in this unexpected abſence; nor
<lb/>did he wonder, for he had often ſeen it
<lb/>in others, at the compoſure with which
          <lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName> argued againſt the indul­
<lb/>gence of uneaſineſs, which he himſelf could 
<lb/>never feel; and he repeated to himſelf, as
<lb/>he longed to ſay to his friend, that it is
<lb/>eaſy to recommend patience with an un­
<lb/>touched or inſenſible heart; patience in

<lb/>evils, that either can never reach the
<lb/>preacher, or which he is incapable of feel­
          <lb/>ing—Some lines of <persName>Shakeſpeare</persName>, appli­
<lb/>cable to the General's remonſtrance, and
<lb/>the uneaſy ſtate of his thoughts, occurred
<lb/>to him as he walked into the garden to 
<lb/>conceal thoſe thoughts from his wife.

            <p>At length the hour arrived when <persName>Or­

            <p>It was equally uſeleſs to argue on the
<lb/>neceſſity of the meaſure, or the diſcretion
<lb/>of <persName>Nanny</persName>. The die was caſt; and to meet
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> ſafely after ſo much hazard had
<lb/>been incurred, was all that it would now
<lb/>anſwer any purpoſe to think of. <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>during his ſhort conference with his own
<lb/>thoughts, had determined to take that night
<lb/>his laſt leave of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and to ſay
<lb/>to her before <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, that he was
<lb/>to ſet out the next morning early, with
<lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName>, for <placeName>London</placeName>. He hoped,
<lb/>by thus acting, to perſuade the aunt of
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> that ſhe might ſafely ſend her
<lb/>back to her former apartment; and that
<lb/>by making an appointment with her for
<lb/><name>Sunday</name>, when he would by the people at
<lb/>the Hall be believed on his way to <placeName>London</placeName>,
<lb/>he ſhould enjoy without interruption the
<lb/>melancholy pleaſure of bidding her adieu,
<lb/>and ſettling the ſafeſt method for their fu­
<lb/>ture correſpondence.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe he wrote to her; and
<lb/>ſealing the letter, he put it into his pocket
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B6</mw>

<pb n="12"/>

<lb/>and repaired to <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; who, un­
<lb/>derſtanding he was come to take his leave,
<lb/>received him with great ſolemnity, yet not
<lb/>with leſs kindneſs than uſual.</p>
            <p>Her converſation conſiſted chiefly of 
<lb/>good advice. She declaimed againſt the
<lb/>vitiated ſtate of modern manners, and re­
<lb/>lated how much better things were in her
<lb/>time. She warned him to beware of the
<lb/>gameſters and bad women, who, ſhe ſaid,
<lb/>were the ruin of all yo<supplied reason="obscured">un</supplied>g people; and
<lb/>gave him, though obliquely, to underſtand,
<lb/>that his future favour with her depended
<lb/>on his behaviour in this his firſt appear­
<lb/>ance in life.</p>
            <p>With her the age of chivalry did not
<lb/>ſeem to be paſſed; for ſhe appeared to
<lb/>conſider <persName>Orlando</persName> as a Damoiſell, now
<lb/>about to make his firſt eſſay in arms. In­
<lb/>deed, while ſhe talked much of modern
<lb/>immorality and diſſipation, ſhe knew very
<lb/>little of modern manners, ſeldom ſeeing
<lb/>any of thoſe people who are what is called
<lb/>people of the world; and forming her ideas
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">of</mw>

<pb n="13"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">13</mw>
<lb/>of what was paſſing in it, only from newſ­
<lb/>papers and the <title ref="b:IT02898">Lady's Magazine</title>; or ſome
<lb/>ſuch publication, which excited only won­
<lb/>der and diſguſt—while her recollection
<lb/>came to her relief, and carried her back to
<lb/>thoſe days ſhe herſelf remembered—and
<lb/>with ſtill greater pleaſure to the relations
<lb/>her father had given of what paſſed in his.
<lb/>The freedom of modern life ſuited ſo ill
<lb/>with the ſolemnity of reſpect that was ſhown
<lb/>towards her in her youth, that ſhe ſhrunk
<lb/>from the uneaſineſs it gave her, and made
<lb/>around her a world of her own: and when
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> became an inhabitant of it, all
<lb/>that regarded him was aſſimilated to her
<lb/>own antediluvian notions.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to her long and ſage lecture,
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> aſſured her, and with great ſince­
<lb/>rity, that he had no wiſhes that were not
<lb/>centred in the ſpot and neighbourhood he
<lb/>was about to leave: that new as he was to
<lb/>the world, he yet believed it would offer
<lb/>him no objects that could a moment detach
<lb/>his affections from his family and his
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">friends.</mw>

<pb n="14"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">14</mw>
<lb/>friends. There was ſo much earneſtneſs,
<lb/>and ſomething ſo impreſſive in the 
<lb/>manner of his ſaying this, as not only
<lb/>enforced belief, but ſenſibly affected <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>. She almoſt repented that ſhe
<lb/>had ever conſented to his going; but
<lb/>to detain him now without acknowledg­
<lb/>ing him as her heir (which ſhe had
<lb/>determined never to do), was not to be
<lb/>thought of; and <persName>General Tracy</persName> had ſuc­
<lb/>ceeded in convincing her, not only that it
<lb/>was a juſtice due to her young relation to
<lb/>give him an opportunity of ſeeing more
<lb/>of mankind; but that, as he would not
<lb/>quit <placeName>England</placeName>, he would enjoy all the ad­
<lb/>vantages of an honourable profeſſion, with­
<lb/>out loſing the advantage of her protection.
<lb/>Without giving implicit credit to the tales
<lb/>by which <persName>Pattenſon</persName> attempted to prejudice
<lb/>him in her favour, ſhe thought enough
<lb/>of them to let them influence in ſome de­
<lb/>gree her determination; and ſhe believed
<lb/>that, if he had formed any improper at­
<lb/>tachment, nothing was ſo likely to break
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">it</mw>

<pb n="15"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">15</mw>
<lb/>it as ſending him from the country, and
<lb/>into ſcenes of life which would, ſhe ſup­
<lb/>poſed, occupy his mind without injuring
<lb/>his morals.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed as if towards the cloſe of her
<lb/>life <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had acquired, inſtead of
<lb/>loſing, her ſenſibility; for ſhe, who had
<lb/>hardly ever loved any body, now found
<lb/>that ſhe could not without pain part from
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>. She felt her pride and pleaſure
<lb/>equally intereſted in exerting towards him
<lb/>that generoſity, which from the reſt of his
<lb/>family ſhe had withheld; and the apparent
<lb/>dejection of his ſpirits, the reluctance with
<lb/>which he left the Hall, made him appear to
<lb/>her more worthy than ever of her favour.
<lb/>When therefore ſhe had exhauſted every
<lb/>topic of advice ſhe could think of, and re­
<lb/>ceived, from the manly ſimplicity of his
<lb/>anſwers, all the aſſurances that words could
<lb/>give of his gratefully receiving it, ſhe pre­
<lb/>ſented him with a bank note of two hun­
<lb/>dred and fifty pounds; which ſhe told him
<lb/>was for the purpoſe of purchaſing what he
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">would</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="B8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">16</mw>
<lb/>would have occaſion for on his firſt en­
<lb/>trance into the army. She had, however,
<lb/>ſo little idea of modern expences, that ſhe
<lb/>really conſidered this as a very great ſum;
<lb/>and ſuch as it was an amazing effort of
<lb/>generoſity in her to part with: yet, while
<lb/>ſhe made this exertion, her kindneſs
<lb/>towards him was ſo far from being ex­
<lb/>hauſted, that ſhe told him he ſhould find
<lb/>her always his banker, ſo long as he con­
<lb/>tinued to give her reaſon to think of him
<lb/>as ſhe thought now.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> kiſſed the hand of his ancient
<lb/>benefactreſs; but the tears were in his eyes,
<lb/>and he was unable to ſpeak. He tried,
<lb/>however, to thank her for this laſt, and for
<lb/>all her former favours to him: but the
<lb/>words were inarticulate; and the old lady
<lb/>herſelf, <quote source="b:IT03257">albeit unuſed to the melting

<lb/>ſhe could only faintly utter the bleſſing ſhe

<lb/>for indeed it will make my lady quite out

<lb/>whom in a few hurried words he expreſſed
<lb/>his thanks for her paſt kindneſs, and his

<lb/>then haſtened away, his heart oppreſſed by
<lb/>the ſcene that had paſſed, yet beating tu­
<lb/>multuouſly with the thoughts of that which
<lb/>was to come.</p>
            <p>He hardly dared, however, give himſelf
<lb/>time to think. He had told <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> a
<lb/>falſehood, for which his ingenuous heart
<lb/>already ſmote him. He was about to act
<lb/>in direct violation of all he had promiſed,

<lb/>ſhould loſe for ever all the advantage of 
<lb/>that favour which <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> now ſo
<lb/>openly avowed for him; and that, if his

<lb/>than almoſt any of the errors againſt which

<lb/>have operated againſt any other indiſcreet
<lb/>indulgence, were powerleſs when put in com­
<lb/>petition with his tender affection for <persName>Mo­

<lb/>to ſpeak to her and conſole her, was what he
<lb/>could not for a moment have endured to
<lb/>think of, if poverty, diſgrace, and exile
<lb/>from every other human being had been the
<lb/>alternatives.</p>
            <p>On entering his room he found it wanted
<lb/>only a few moments of ſeven. He glided
<lb/>therefore round the houſe, and found his 
<lb/>punctual confident already waiting for the
<lb/>ſignal. <said>We need not both be here,</said>

            <p>The caſement at length ſoftly opened,
<lb/>and <persName>Monimia</persName> appeared at it. He ſpoke
<lb/>to her, and bade her let down the ſtring

<lb/>ſaid he, <said>more than my life depends.—
<lb/>Read it then, <persName>Monimia</persName>, read it quickly,

            <p>The trembling girl, whoſe hurry of

<lb/>away with the letter; and, in an inſtant,
<lb/>threw down a piece of paper on which ſhe

<lb/>cern theſe words, he was compelled to go
<lb/>back to his own room to read them. The
<lb/>doubt they left upon his mind diſtracted
<lb/>him; but it was a doubt which, if he at­
<lb/>tempted to remove it, would become a cer­
<lb/>tainty that would deſtroy this faint ray of
<lb/>hope. He went back, however, to the
<lb/>window, in hopes that he might yet ſpeak
<lb/>one word to <persName>Monimia</persName>; but he ſaw that 
<lb/>there was now another candle in the room;
<lb/>and, retiring a little farther ſo as to be able

<lb/>Lennard</persName> walking in the room, and appa­
<lb/>rently buſied in the uſual occupations to

<lb/>of his abſence. He ſent <persName>Jacob</persName>, therefore,
<lb/>into the kitchen to give ſome farther orders
<lb/>about forwarding his trunks and baggage
<lb/>to the next market town, as they were to

<lb/>mournfully and reluctantly, prepared to
<lb/>leave the room where he had paſſed ſo
<lb/>many happy hours—the room where his
<lb/>mind firſt taſted the charms of literature,
<lb/>and his heart of love. It was indeed poſ­
<lb/>ſible that he might once more reviſit it,
<lb/>once more that evening with <persName>Monimia</persName>;
<lb/>but it was alſo poſſible, perhaps moſt pro­
<lb/>bable, that he might not ſee her again.</p>
            <p>A thouſand painful reflections preſented
<lb/>themſelves. He left her expoſed to num­
<lb/>berleſs inconveniences; and his late raſh­
<lb/>neſs had, perhaps, added to them by put­
<lb/>ting her into the power of ſervants. Yet
<lb/>he might be denied an opportunity to put
<lb/>her upon her guard againſt any of the cir­
<lb/>cumſtances he foreſaw, or even to ſettle how
<lb/>ſhe might receive his letters.</p>
            <p>He traverſed the library, yielding to
<lb/>theſe tormenting thoughts; and, by the
<lb/>light of the ſolitary candle he had ſet down
<lb/>in the window ſeat, every thing appeared
<lb/>gloomy and terrific. Every object and

<lb/>that conſtantly occurred to him—<said><persName>Orlando</persName><lb/>will reviſit this houſe no more.</said> It is dif­
<lb/>ficult to ſay how long he would have in­
<lb/>dulged this mournful reverie (notwith­
<lb/>ſtanding his reſolution juſt before taken to
<lb/>quit the houſe with as much noiſe as poſ­
<lb/>ſible), if he had not been alarmed by the 
<lb/>ſound of a female ſtep in the adjoining
<lb/>parlour. He ſtarted. It was perhaps <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>! He flew to the door; and there, with
<lb/>too evident marks of diſappointment in his
<lb/>countenance, he diſcovered it to be <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName> herſelf, who with a candle in her

<lb/>her air, ſtalked into the Study—<said>I am

<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> would have faced a cannon with
<lb/>leſs trepidation than he waited for this meſ­
<lb/>ſage, which his conſcience told him might
<lb/>relate to <persName>Monimia</persName>. It proved, however,
<lb/>to be only that he would give to <persName>Lennard</persName>
<lb/>the keys of the rooms; and that ſhe might

<lb/>though it diſappointed him wholly of his
<lb/>hopes of meeting <persName>Monimia</persName> there, it was im­
<lb/>poſſible to object. The cautious houſe­
<lb/>keeper, therefore, barricaded every avenue
<lb/>to this apartment, without forgetting the
<lb/>door that led to the chapel; and then, for­
<lb/>mally enquiring if <persName>Orlando</persName> had taken out
<lb/>every thing he wiſhed to have, to which
<lb/>he anſwered Yes (as his boxes had been
<lb/>moved the preceding day), ſhe ſaid ſhe
<lb/>would follow him; and he left the room
<lb/>with an additional pang, while <persName>Mrs. Len­

<lb/>lemnly after him.</p>
            <p>Towards the middle of the great parlour,

<lb/>difficulty therefore aroſe: he knew not what
<lb/>to do with <persName>Jacob</persName> and the horſes, which he
<lb/>now repented that he had uſed. If he ſent
<lb/>them on to his father's, it would be ſuſpected
<lb/>by a family who were every hour looking

<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>: if he left them in the wood, the

            <p>The man obeyed; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, making
<lb/>a circuit through the woods, in order to re­

<lb/>and to have as little of the open part of the

<lb/>at the manſion which he had ſo lately quitted
<lb/>as for the laſt time.—He walked very ſlowly
<lb/>on purpoſe; and his thoughts were ſuch as
<lb/>brought with them only dejection and ſor­
<lb/>row.</p>
            <p>He could not help recollecting with 
<lb/>regret, thoſe hours, now gone for ever,
<lb/>when, in his early youth, he traverſed
<lb/>theſe paths—happy in the preſent, and
<lb/>thoughtleſs of the future;—when he had
<lb/>no paſſion to torment, no fears for its
<lb/>object to depreſs him; but went to <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName> with the ſame ſimple eagerneſs as any
<lb/>of his ſiſters or his other playfellows, and
<lb/>was unconſcious that the reſt of their lives
<lb/>would be embittered with anxiety and diſ­
<lb/>appointment—perhaps remorſe.—<persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>already felt ſomething like it: with the moſt
<lb/>candid and ingenuous temper he had lived
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſome</mw>

<pb n="31"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">31</mw>
<lb/>ſome time in a courſe of deception—he
<lb/>had taught it to the innocent, unſuſpecting
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, and had ſullied the native can­
<lb/>dour and integrity of her character. The
<lb/>ſophiſtry by which he had formerly pre­
<lb/>vailed upon her to conſent to their clandeſ­
<lb/>tine meetings, now ſeemed mean and con­
<lb/>temptible; but perhaps, in thinking thus,
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> was too much like other tranſgreſ­
<lb/>ſors, who repent becauſe they can ſin no

            <p>He thought himſelf, however, firmly de­
<lb/>termined that, had he ſtaid at the Hall, he
<lb/>would, at whatever hazard, act with more
<lb/>openneſs; but as he was going from it,
<lb/>there could be no harm in this laſt adieu.
<lb/>In writing to <persName>Monimia</persName> there could be no­
<lb/>thing wrong, eſpecially as he meant not to
<lb/>make a ſecret of it to his father and <persName>Selina</persName>,
<lb/>nor indeed to any of his own family: while
<lb/>the peculiarities of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and the

<lb/>ed fully to juſtify his not revealing to them

            <p>Amid theſe diſquieting and contradictory
<lb/>reflections, he at laſt reached the Hall. It
<lb/>was the darkeſt of <name>December</name> nights, but
<lb/>calm and ſtill. <persName>Orlando</persName> walked ſlowly
<lb/>round the houſe, which, ſave a glimmering
<lb/>light from the window of <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName>
<lb/>room, bore no appearance of being inha­
<lb/>bited. His longing eyes, which had anxi­
<lb/>ouſly watched for ſome conſoling beam
<lb/>from the turret, whither they had ſo often
<lb/>been turned with tranſport, now ſought for
<lb/>the propitious ray in vain. Still it was poſ­
<lb/>ſible <persName>Monimia</persName> might be there, but, from her
<lb/>aunt's late ſuſpicions, deprived of a light.
<lb/>As the houſe ſeemed perfectly quiet, he
<lb/>ventured up to the well-known door, and,
<lb/>liſtening awhile, tapped at it; no anſwer
<lb/>was given!—he repeated the ſignal louder;
<lb/>ſtill no delicious ſounds were heard in re­
<lb/>turn!—and, convinced at length that his
<lb/>project had wholly failed, and <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>was ſtill a priſoner, he became half frantic,
<lb/>from the reflection that he had hazarded

<lb/>gined a fineſſe, and aſſerted a falſehood,
<lb/>and perhaps muſt at laſt go without ſeeing
<lb/>her, his heart torn at once by his own ſuf­
<lb/>ferings and by the idea of hers.</p>
            <p>In ſtepping back to return down the
<lb/>ſtairs, when after a long ſtay all hope had
<lb/>forſaken him, his foot ſtruck ſomething
<lb/>before him, which ſeemed to be a parcel:
<lb/>as not a ray of light entered the place
<lb/>where he was, he felt for this with his
<lb/>hands, and, at length finding it, he diſco­
<lb/>vered it to be a ſmall book: it was tied
<lb/>with a packthread; and <persName>Orlando</persName> immedi­
<lb/>ately ſuppoſed, what was indeed the truth,
<lb/>that <persName>Monimia</persName>, not being permitted to re­
<lb/>turn that evening to ſleep in her former

<lb/>tence or other entered it, and depoſited at

<lb/>He opened the book with trembling hands,

<lb/>feeling the ground as he went, he arrived, in
<lb/>a ſtate of mind ſo uneaſy and confuſed, that
<lb/>he no longer was capable of caution or re­
<lb/>ſerve; but haſtening into the kitchen, where
<lb/>he firſt perceived a light, he ſnatched up a 
<lb/>candle without ſpeaking, and was hurrying
<lb/>with it to his own room, when his father,
<lb/>who had been anxiouſly watching his arri­
<lb/>val, opened the door through which he was 
<lb/>preparing to paſs up ſtairs; and ſeeing him
<lb/>pale and breathleſs, his eyes wild, and his
<lb/>hair diſhevelled, he concluded that ſome­
<lb/>thing very terrible had happened to his
<lb/>brother.—The raſh, unthinking, and vehe­
<lb/>ment character of <persName>Philip</persName>, his wild profuſion,
<lb/>and unſettled principles, had of late ſo ha­
<lb/>raſſed the imagination of his father, that he
<lb/>now thought only of his committing ſuicide;
<lb/>and the ſudden appearance of <persName>Orlando</persName>, in
<lb/>ſuch an agitated ſtate, ſtruck him with the
<lb/>idea that this fatal event had happened—

<lb/>moment only of <persName>Monimia</persName>, and was impa­
<lb/>tient at every interruption, was, however,
<lb/>ſo ſtruck with this exclamation, and with
<lb/>the look of anguiſh that accompanied it,
<lb/>that he ſtopped, and, with terror equal to
<lb/>that with which he had been addreſſed,
<lb/>cried, <said>What, my dear Sir! for Heaven's 
<lb/>ſake what has happened? My mother, my
<lb/>ſiſters!</said>—<said>Oh, your brother!</said> interrupted
<lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>—<said>tell me the worſt at once,
<lb/>it cannot be more dreadful than my fears

<lb/>have heard nothing?</said></p>
            <p><said>No!</said> cried <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, a little re­
<lb/>covering from his apprehenſion. <said>Speak

<lb/>repeat an hundred times proteſtations of 
<lb/>tenderneſs which he never felt more forci­

<lb/>of not ſeeing her, were appeaſed, the ſcene
<lb/>he had juſt paſſed through with his father
<lb/>recurred with more acute pain to his mind:
<lb/>he had promiſed to reveal the ſecret which
<lb/>was already ſuſpected; but, though he
<lb/>firmly adhered to this reſolution, ſurely his
<lb/>father would not inſiſt upon his promiſe to
<lb/>give up all thoughts of <persName>Monimia</persName>—That he
<lb/>felt to be a promiſe which he could not
<lb/>make—his whole heart recoiled from it.
<lb/>Ah! why was it thus impoſſible to recon­
<lb/>cile his duty and his love; and why ſhould
<lb/>his attachment to <persName>Monimia</persName> be inconſiſtent
<lb/>with the attention his family would have
<lb/>a right to—if—if his father ſhould die?—
<lb/>The very idea of his father's death was in­
<lb/>ſupportable; and yet he was going from
<lb/>him, and could not watch his health, or
<lb/>contribute to his comfort. Thus wretched
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> tried in vain to ſleep—his blood
<lb/>throbbed tumultuouſly in his veins; his heart
<lb/>ſeemed too big for his boſom; by carrying
<lb/>his thoughts to the dreadful parting of the

<lb/>taſting any preſent repoſe; and day ap­
<lb/>peared before his troubled thoughts had
<lb/>ſo wearied his frame as to allow him to fall
<lb/>into unquiet ſlumber. Even in his ſhort and
<lb/>diſturbed ſleep, tormenting viſions aſſailed
<lb/>him—he ſaw the funeral of his father,
<lb/>who yet appeared living, or at leaſt appear­
<lb/>ing to him, though dead—and pointing
<lb/>with one hand to his mother and his ſiſters,
<lb/>while with the other he waved him away
<lb/>from <persName>Monimia</persName>, who, at a diſtance, ſeemed
<lb/>to ſit dejected and alone, in a wild and
<lb/>dreary ſcene, where birds of prey ſcreamed
<lb/>around her—from which ſhe endeavoured
<lb/>to eſcape towards <persName>Orlando</persName>, and held out
<lb/>her hands to him for help in vain. A re­
<lb/>petition of theſe unformed horrors took
<lb/>away all inclination to ſleep. At ſeven
<lb/>o'clock <persName>Orlando</persName> left his bed, more dejected
<lb/>than ever he felt before; and dreading the
<lb/>dialogue that muſt enſue, he joined his
<lb/>father, who was walking, melancholy and
<lb/>alone, in the garden.</p>

<lb/>when he began to love <persName>Monimia</persName> better
<lb/>than any of his ſiſters; when, in going to

<lb/>than of the amuſements in which he was
<lb/>indulged, and often refuſed to ride out on
<lb/>a horſe <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> allowed him occa­
<lb/>ſionally to have when he was about eleven
<lb/>years old, or to go to play with the men
<lb/>in the park; becauſe, at the hours when
<lb/>theſe recreations were offered him, he had
<lb/>opportunities of ſitting with <persName>Monimia</persName>, who
<lb/>was employed by her aunt to pick cowſlips
<lb/>from their ſtalks, to collect roſe leaves, or
<lb/>dry flowers and herbs in the houſe-keeper's

<lb/>woman who has always ſtood between me 
<lb/>and the countenance of my relation; a wo­
<lb/>man who, in all probability, will finally
<lb/>rob me of my birth-right.—Unhappy, ill-
<lb/>ſtarred boy! Do you not ſee that, by this
<lb/>miſplaced attachment, you have put it into

<lb/>the hopes you have been cheriſhing? Do
<lb/>you not ſee that you have put yourſelf upon
<lb/>her mercy? that, under pretence of not
<lb/>knowing of this clandeſtine love, ſhe has
<lb/>ſuffered it to go on? ſecure of being able
<lb/>to ruin you at any time with her Lady
<lb/>by diſcovering it, and making a merit of
<lb/>her own diſintereſted conduct.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> felt that there was too much
<lb/>truth in this obſervation; but the greater
<lb/>thoſe hazards were that he incurred for

<lb/><said>Well, Sir,</said> ſaid he, 
<said>and if <persName>Mrs. Ray­

<lb/>the daughter of a man in trade? It is of no
<lb/>uſe to inveigh againſt, or inveſtigate the
<lb/>cauſe of all theſe ſupercilious diſtinctions in 
<lb/>the mind of our old couſin: we know that,
<lb/>unluckily for us, they exiſt; and we know
<lb/>they are invincible. How do you think a

<lb/>there is ſome reaſon to think ſhe may make

            <p>The emphaſis laid on the word reaſonable

            <p>This ſpeech was ill calculated to appeaſe

<lb/>and he was on the point of anſwering with
<lb/>more warmth than he ever in his life ven­
<lb/>tured to uſe, when fortunately, to ſave him
<lb/>from repentance, which would inſtantly
<lb/>have followed if he had given his father
<lb/>greater pain, the General joined them, and,
<lb/>after a few common compliments, they
<lb/>were met, as they walked towards the houſe,
<lb/>by <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> with a ſummons to
<lb/>breakfaſt. Though the interpoſition of the
<lb/>General had a little relieved both, the en­
<lb/>quiring eyes of <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName> were not
<lb/>eaſily evaded or deceived: ſhe ſaw, and
<lb/>trembled to ſee, the emotions that ſhook the
<lb/>ſoul of her huſband; while, on the expreſ­
<lb/>ſive features of <persName>Orlando</persName>, diſquiet and an­
<lb/>guiſh, mingled with ſomething of diſap­
<lb/>pointment and reſentment, were too viſibly
<lb/>to be traced by maternal ſolicitude. The
<lb/>presence of the General, however, and of the
<lb/>three girls, prevented her ſpeaking of what
<lb/>ſo much affected her; by degrees the clouds
<lb/>upon her huſband's brow ſeemed leſs heavy;

<lb/>attempts he evidently made to ſhake off his
<lb/>concern, were quite ineffectual; and as ſoon
<lb/>as his haſty breakfaſt was over, he took his
<lb/>hat, and, turning to his mother, enquired
<lb/>whether the dinner hour was as uſual (for
<lb/>on <name>Sundays</name> the family were ſometimes ac­
<lb/>cuſtomed to dine earlier)? ſhe anſwered that
<lb/>it was; and <persName>Orlando</persName>, then ſlightly bowing
<lb/>to the reſt, was leaving the room, when his
<lb/>father cried, <said>I thought you were to paſs
<lb/>this laſt day of your ſtay in the country with
<lb/>us, <persName>Orlando</persName>!</said>—<said>I ſhall be back to dinner,
<lb/>Sir,</said> replied he as he ſhut the door.—<persName>Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, who, in the dread of his loſing <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland's</persName> favour, and in his hatred to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName>, had ſpoken of <persName>Monimia</persName> with
<lb/>more aſperity than he felt, was now con­
<lb/>vinced that harſhneſs would have little in­
<lb/>fluence on the warm impetuous ſpirit of his
<lb/>ſon; that he would have done better to
<lb/>have truſted to mildneſs and perſuaſion,
<lb/>and to have treated him in this inſtance, as
<lb/>he had hitherto always done, rather with
<lb/>the gentleneſs of a friend, than the autho­

            <p>Stung with regret, anguiſh, and diſap­
<lb/>pointment, <persName>Orlando</persName> wandered away from
<lb/>the houſe, hardly knowing why, or whither
<lb/>he was going. Inſtead of obtaining for
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> his father's protection, and the
<lb/>countenance of his family during his ab­
<lb/>ſence, with which he had fondly flattered
<lb/>himſelf, he had heard what almoſt amount­
<lb/>ed to a prohibition againſt thinking of her
<lb/>any more; and his own candour and ſince­
<lb/>rity, to which he had been taught ſo religi­
<lb/>ouſly to adhere, had apparently done him
<lb/>more miſchief than the hints which his bro­
<lb/>ther had thrown out, who had (as he lately
<lb/>learned from <persName>Selina</persName>) never ceaſed attempt­
<lb/>ing, during his laſt viſit at home, to impreſs
<lb/>his father and mother with a notion, that
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> had not only a correſpondence,
<lb/>but a correſpondence of the moſt criminal
<lb/>nature, with <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> niece. <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Somerive</persName>, always unwilling to ſee the faults
<lb/>of one ſon, or to hear of the ſuppoſed faults
<lb/>of another, had ſometimes evaded, and ap­
<lb/>peared, when ſhe was forced to hear it,

<pb n="58"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">58</mw>
<lb/>quite indifferent to this information; while
<lb/><persName>Somerive</persName>, whatever credit he might give to
<lb/>the exiſtence of what he thought ſuch a
<lb/>fooliſh and boyiſh inclination, diſcouraged
<lb/>this invidious diſpoſition in his eldeſt ſon; and
<lb/>though he ſometimes felt a good deal alarmed
<lb/>about <persName>Orlando</persName>, he thought ſo contemptibly of 
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, becauſe he had learned early
<lb/>in life to deſpiſe and diſlike her, that he could
<lb/>hardly imagine it poſſible for a relation of
<lb/>hers to make a laſting impreſſion on a 
<lb/>young man of ſo much taſte and ſpirit.
<lb/>He was however often uneaſy, and particu­
<lb/>larly after the dinner party at <name>Stockton's</name>,
<lb/>on this ſubject; but, upon enquiry, he
<lb/>could not find that <persName>Monimia</persName> was a girl
<lb/>likely long to captivate his ſon, or to en­
<lb/>gage him in a ſerious attachment. Some
<lb/>perſons told him, indeed, that ſhe was a
<lb/>pretty girl; others, that ſhe was a handſome
<lb/>girl; but more, that there was not any
<lb/>thing very extraordinary in her: while from
<lb/>other quarters he heard that her aunt treated
<lb/>her like a common ſervant, except that 
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſhe</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="D6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">59</mw>
<lb/>ſhe never ſat in the kitchen or the ſervants
<lb/>hall; and that ſhe hardly ever was ſeen by
<lb/>any of the family, being employed in at­
<lb/>tending <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> only when ſhe was 
<lb/>ſick, and at other times in waiting upon
<lb/>or working for <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> in her own
<lb/>room. <persName>Somerive</persName> therefore thought, that
<lb/>whatever childiſh affection his ſon might
<lb/>have felt for her, could hardly have any
<lb/>ſerious termination, or any that could injure
<lb/>him with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; and if now and
<lb/>then, on remarking ſome peculiarity in
<lb/><persName>Orlando's</persName> conduct or looks, he recollected
<lb/><persName>Philip's</persName> wild aſſertions about this <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">fair
<lb/>maid of the Hall,</soCalled> as he was accuſtomed
<lb/>in ridicule to call her, the hope that ſuch
<lb/>childiſh love would be forgotten, and the
<lb/>idea he had taken up that <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>
<lb/>kept her niece quite out of <persName>Orlando's</persName> way,
<lb/>and treated her as a mere ſervant, quieted
<lb/>his alarms; for which indeed he had no re­
<lb/>medy, for he could not either object to
<lb/>any perſon whom <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> choſe
<lb/>ſhould inhabit her houſe, or remove <persName>Or­

<lb/>lando</persName> from it till the preſent period, when
<lb/>he had her conſent and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But to whatever motives the conduct
<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> was really owing, <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> had ſeen it in that view only that was
<lb/>the moſt flattering to his ſanguine hopes:
<lb/>they now appeared to be deſtroyed for ever,
<lb/>and he ſaw only deſpair before him. Far
<lb/>from being allowed to aſk his mother's
<lb/>permiſſion for <persName>Selina</persName> to ſee his <persName>Monimia</persName>,
<lb/>he dared not name her again, leſt he ſhould
<lb/>receive an injunction which the certainty of
<lb/>immediate death would not compel him to
<lb/>obey; and his projected confeſſion that he
<lb/>was going in the evening to meet her for the
<lb/>laſt time, he now had not courage to make.
<lb/>Yet he could not diſguiſe it; for, ſince the
<lb/>General's reſidence in this family, their ſim­
<lb/>plicity of living, and their hours, had been
<lb/>entirely changed; and inſtead of dining at 
<lb/>three, as had been always their cuſtom, they
<lb/>now called it four; but it was often, in com­
<lb/>pliance with the General's habits, near an
<lb/>hour later; five was the hour <persName>Monimia</persName>

<lb/>named in her note; it was perhaps the
<lb/>only one in which ſhe had a chance of 
<lb/>eſcaping: therefore, whatever might be the
<lb/>diſpleaſure it occaſioned to his father and his
<lb/>family, whatever might be their conjectures
<lb/>and remarks, he muſt either fail returning
<lb/>to dine with them, or break away perhaps
<lb/>before the removal of the table cloth; to
<lb/>do the former would have been leſs uneaſy
<lb/>to himſelf, but he feared it would be more
<lb/>offenſive to his family. Reſolutely deter­
<lb/>mined to ſee <persName>Monimia</persName> at all events, he
<lb/>fixed upon the latter; but as he could bear
<lb/>no more of his father's diſpleaſure than
<lb/>what he was ſure, he thought, of hearing
<lb/>when he returned from his laſt dear inter­
<lb/>view, he could not reſolve to go back to
<lb/>the houſe, but continued walking, almoſt
<lb/>mechanically, towards <name>Rayland Hall</name>, for­
<lb/>getting, in the extreme agitation of his ſpi­
<lb/>rits, how very material it was that he ſhould
<lb/>not be ſeen after he had taken his laſt leave
<lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and ſhe believed him

            <p>This never occurred to him till, under
<lb/>a hollow ſand cliff that bounded one ſide of
<lb/>the great pond, near the mill, on the verge
<lb/>of the park, he ſuddenly heard the rattle
<lb/>of a carriage, and, looking behind him,
<lb/>ſaw <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> coach ſtopping at the
<lb/>gate, within two hundred yards of him. He
<lb/>then recollected the contemptible figure he
<lb/>ſhould make, and the irreparable injury it
<lb/>would do him with her, if he were detected
<lb/>in a falſehood, accompanied too with appa­
<lb/>rent ingratitude; but it was almoſt too late
<lb/>to eſcape, for on one ſide was the water,
<lb/>and on the other a high and almoſt perpen­
<lb/>dicular bank, that in ſome places hung
<lb/>over the road:—he had not, however, a
<lb/>moment's time to deliberate; but, seizing
<lb/>one of the roots that grew out of the ſides,
<lb/>he ſprang up, not without ſome hazard of
<lb/>pulling the crumbling looſe ſoil, of which
<lb/>the bank was formed, upon him:—two ſteps

<lb/>ſituation than below, if the holly, hazle,
<lb/>broom, and branches of pollard oaks that
<lb/>clothed the top of the eminence, had not
<lb/>afforded him a friendly concealment:—he
<lb/>threw himſelf among them; and then, per­
<lb/>fectly ſure that he could not be ſeen, he
<lb/>peeped among the withered leaves of the 
<lb/>oak and the thicker green of the holly, and
<lb/>ſaw very diſtinctly the carriage approach,
<lb/>in which, with a palpitating heart, he ſaw
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> ſitting backwards with her aunt,
<lb/>while <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> alone occupied the
<lb/>oppoſite ſeat. He then recollected, that
<lb/>this was the day on which <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>uſually went in ſtate to the church of a
<lb/>neighbouring pariſh; a ceremony that was
<lb/>performed four times a year, when the wea­
<lb/>ther did not forbid it. He was amazed at
<lb/>his own thoughtleſs indiſcretion; and ſaw
<lb/>that he owed his eſcape from its conſe­
<lb/>quences to a mere accident. On theſe oc­
<lb/>caſions a footman went behind, and <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Pattenſon</persName> rode in great form by the coach

<lb/>ſide. It happened that the man behind
<lb/>the coach had been ordered by his Lady,
<lb/>at the church-door, to call with a meſſage
<lb/>upon her tenant, the miller, whom not be­
<lb/>ing immediately able to find, he ſtaid
<lb/>while he was enquired for; and <persName>Pattenſon</persName>
<lb/>was under the neceſſity of diſmounting to
<lb/>open the gate, which, as he was extremely

<lb/>horſe, was by no means the work of a mo­
<lb/>ment. <persName>Orlando</persName>, after his apprehenſions
<lb/>were at an end, found in this little incident
<lb/>ſomething from which he drew a favourable
<lb/>omen: he was pleaſed to ſee that, in con­

<lb/>was indulged with a greater degree of li­
<lb/>berty, and ſeemed much in favour with
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> and her aunt: and it ſeemed
<lb/>as if deſtiny, however remotely, was de­

<lb/>breakfaſt her Father and <persName>General Tracy</persName> 
<lb/>had walked out together, at the deſire of
<lb/>the latter: where the General had opened
<lb/>his intention of offering himſelf to <persName>Iſabella</persName> 
<lb/>as an huſband—of making very great ſet­
<lb/>tlements if ſhe accepted of him—and, in
<lb/><choice><sic>in</sic><corr/></choice> ſhort, ſaid <persName>Selina</persName>, <said>he made the pro­
<lb/>poſal appear ſo advantageous to my father,
<lb/>that the diſparity of age ſeemed by no
<lb/>means a ſufficient objection againſt accept­
<lb/>ing it:—he therefore referred the General
<lb/>wholly to <persName>Iſabella</persName> herſelf, with whom he
<lb/>converſed as ſoon as he returned home,
<lb/>repreſenting his own ſituation, which cer­
<lb/>tainly affords us all but a melancholy pro­
<lb/>ſpect, <persName>Orlando</persName>. He even told <persName>Belle</persName>, in
<lb/>regard to our circumſtances, ſome par­
<lb/>ticulars which have been owing to <persName>Philip's</persName>
<lb/>expences, that my father ſays he has not
<lb/>ventured to tell even to my mother, becauſe
<lb/>they would half kill her.—It ſeems that we

<lb/>ſupport us all, above fourſcore pounds a
<lb/>year; my mother's ſettlement, which, as
<lb/>ſhe had ſo ſmall a fortune, was all ſhe
<lb/>would let my father ſettle upon her.—This,
<lb/>you know, is not twenty pounds a piece for
<lb/>us; and <persName>Iſabella</persName> would not certainly be
<lb/>happy with ſuch a pittance, if it were poſ­
<lb/>ſible for her to live upon it: only, there­
<lb/>fore, conſider what a contraſt the General's
<lb/>offers make—Beſides the power ſuch a match
<lb/>would give her to make our dear parents
<lb/>eaſy (which I own is the only circumſtance
<lb/>that would ſhake my reſolution were I in her
<lb/>place), ſhe would be raiſed ſo much in
<lb/>rank! and have ſuch a large fortune!—ſo
<lb/>much ſplendour round her! things which
<lb/>you know <persName>Belle</persName> has no diſlike to, that I

<lb/>rude things about his wig and his falſe
<lb/>teeth, and the art he uſed to make himſelf
<lb/>look young, that I have wondered an hun­
<lb/>dred times how he bore it: but afterwards
<lb/>he grew more importunate, indeed I
<lb/>thought impertinent, and <persName>Belle</persName> threatened
<lb/>to ſpeak to my father. As for my mother,
<lb/>we agreed to tell her the ſort of language
<lb/>he held whenever he could get my ſiſter
<lb/>alone, or with only me and <persName>Emma</persName>; and
<lb/>my poor mother, afraid of diſobliging a
<lb/>man who ſhe thought had been ſuch a 
<lb/>friend to you, and might be to the whole
<lb/>family, deſired we would not tell my father,
<lb/>who would certainly have reſented ſuch
<lb/>behaviour, and contented herſelf with keep­

<lb/>yet their habit of doing ſo would make their
<lb/>abſence little remarked on an evening when
<lb/>a buſineſs was in debate ſo momentous as 
<lb/><persName>Iſabella's</persName> anſwer. The brother and ſiſter

<lb/>rations, before they were told the dinner
<lb/>was ready; and on their entering the din­

            <p><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, though ſhe had collected

<lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> in ſuſpenſe!—Her dread leſt her
<lb/>daughter ſhould ſacrifice herſelf and be
<lb/>unhappy, oppoſed to her wiſhes that ſhe
<lb/>might be eſtabliſhed in ſuch high affluence,
<lb/>made her mind a chaos of contending emo­
<lb/>tions; while <persName>Somerive</persName> himſelf, reading in
<lb/>her countenance all that paſſed in her heart,
<lb/>and knowing, even better than ſhe did,
<lb/>how neceſſary ſuch an alliance was to the
<lb/>preſervation of all the family, was even
<lb/>more affected; but he had yet ſtrength of
<lb/>mind enough to conceal it better, and to ap­
<lb/>pear calm, though thoughtful and melan­
<lb/>choly, frequently turning his eyes on <persName>Iſa­
<lb/>bella</persName>, who ſeemed in a kind of elegant lan­

<lb/>guor, the effect of her debate between duty
<lb/>and indifference; though, in fact, it had
<lb/>been held much more between averſion 
<lb/>and vanity, in which the latter hardly needed
<lb/>the aid of any other conſideration to come
<lb/>off conquerer.</p>
            <p>In a family party ſo ſituated, there was
<lb/>not, of courſe, much converſation, and the
<lb/>dinner paſſed without any body's eating,
<lb/>though each preſſed the other to eat, and
<lb/>affected to eat themſelves.—<persName>Orlando</persName> hardly
<lb/>ſpoke three words, and thoſe were addreſſed
<lb/>to his mother, the intereſting concern of
<lb/>whoſe ſtill beautiful countenance wounded
<lb/>his very ſoul. Diſtracted between the fear
<lb/>of adding to that concern by his abrupt
<lb/>departure, and of a failing in his appoint­
<lb/>ment with <persName>Monimia</persName>, he believed this dinner,
<lb/>uſeleſs as it was, was the very longeſt he ever
<lb/>ſat down to. Juſt as the table-cloth was re­
<lb/>moved, he heard the clock ſtrike five; and,
<lb/>looking at his watch, which went by the

<lb/>every other conſideration vaniſhed; and,
<lb/>ſtarting up, without even attempting an

<lb/>detain him a moment. He ruſhed out of 
<lb/>the houſe, and ran, with the ſwiftneſs of an

            <p>By the time he arrived there, it was almoſt
<lb/>dark; but he diſcerned between the ſtems of

<lb/>the ſeat he had marked to her as the place
<lb/>of their meeting. Never before did he 
<lb/>ſeem to love her ſo ardently as at that
<lb/>moment; his heart was ſoftened by the
<lb/>thoughts of their immediate ſeparation,
<lb/>while, oppreſſed by the occurrences of the

<lb/>knowing what he did, he threw himſelf on

<lb/>bathed them with his tears.</p>
            <p>The trembling girl, who had been there
<lb/>even earlier than her appointment, and
<lb/>who had, amid an hundred other fears,
<lb/>deſpaired of his coming, trembling, and
<lb/>unable immediately to weep, hung over
<lb/>him, as with frantic geſtures he ſpoke to
<lb/>her; and when ſhe would have reproached
<lb/>him for the apprehenſions in which he had
<lb/>left her, her words were inarticulate; and
<lb/>it was ſome time before either of them
<lb/>was able to congratulate the other that they
<lb/>thus met once more!</p>
            <p>Alas! the bitter certainty that a long,

<lb/>ed the pleaſure of their meeting: neither

<lb/>half forget the diſparity of the ages, and

            <p><persName>Monimia</persName> felt a weight, heavy as the
<lb/>hand of death, taken off her heart, when he
<lb/>told her they were, in conſequence of this
<lb/>new family arrangement, likely ſo ſoon to
<lb/>meet again. Her mind, which had dwelt
<lb/>with horror on the idea of a ſeparation for
<lb/>months, perhaps for years, was now re­
<lb/>lieved, by ſuppoſing it might not be for
<lb/>more than three weeks; and knowing no­
<lb/>thing of military rules, ſhe ſuppoſed that after
<lb/>the firſt forms of entering on his new profeſ­
<lb/>ſion were gone through, he might return to
<lb/>the Hall; and that if ſhe could not, from that
<lb/>active watchfulneſs which her aunt might
<lb/>then renew, ſee him every day, ſhe ſhould
<lb/>at leaſt know that he was under the ſame

<lb/>roof, or within a few miles of her; to know
<lb/>even that he was in the ſame county, was a 
<lb/>ſatisfaction; ſhe ſhould hear <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>ſpeak of him, if ſhe was herſelf deprived of
<lb/>the happineſs of meeting him; ſhe ſhould
<lb/>ſee him in the park, and hear his voice
<lb/>ſpeaking to others, if he was not allowed
<lb/>to ſpeak to her. Perhaps <persName>Mrs. Len­
<lb/>nard</persName>, convinced by this abſence that her
<lb/>ſuſpicions had been groundleſs, might
<lb/>leſs vigilantly oppoſe their future inter­
<lb/>courſe. All theſe hopes—for the hopes of a
<lb/>young and inexperienced mind, are ſan­
<lb/>guine and eaſily received—ſerved ſo far
<lb/>to aſſuage the pain <persName>Monimia</persName> had felt on
<lb/>their firſt meeting, that ſhe became ſoon
<lb/>able to converſe with calmneſs; and not
<lb/>only quieted her own troubled ſpirits, but
<lb/>endeavoured to ſoothe and compoſe thoſe
<lb/>of <persName>Orlando</persName>. Her voice had upon his heart
<lb/>the power of magic—deliciouſly ſoothing as
<lb/>it was, it excited that ſort of painful plea­
<lb/>ſure which is only expreſſed by tears.

<lb/>in terror; but her lover immediately ap­
<lb/>peaſed her fears, by telling her what his
<lb/>haſte and the tumult of his mind had made
<lb/>him before omit, that he had appointed
<lb/><persName>Selina</persName> to meet them. They now therefore
<lb/>(as it was ſo nearly dark that they could
<lb/>hardly diſtinguiſh their way) haſtened to­
<lb/>gether towards that part of the wood from
<lb/>whence the voice came; and they ſoon met
<lb/>the poor terrified <persName>Selina</persName>, who, almoſt ſpeech­
<lb/>leſs with fear, on finding herſelf ſo far from
<lb/>home alone, and in a night that threatened
<lb/>impenetrable darkneſs, trembled like a leaf,
<lb/>and ſaid to <persName>Orlando</persName>, as he took her arm
<lb/>within his, that the whole world ſhould not
<lb/>have bribed her to venture what ſhe had

            <p>He led again towards the bench by the

            <p><said>Nor would I,</said> replied her brother;
<lb/><said>no <persName>Selina</persName>, there is not in the world any
<lb/>ſacrifice I would not make to both or either
<lb/>of my parents, except that of my affections

<lb/>which he kiſſed as he united them, he be­
<lb/>ſought them to love each other when he
<lb/>was gone, and to conſider each other as
<lb/>more than ſiſters! He told <persName>Monimia</persName>, it was
<lb/>in cover of his letters to <persName>Selina</persName> he propoſed
<lb/>to write to her, and not by the means of the
<lb/>under game-keeper, as he had once propo­
<lb/>ſed; and he then enquired if they could

<lb/>joy the delight of ſeeing together the two
<lb/>beings whom I moſt fondly love, and of
<lb/>knowing they are occupied with the thoughts
<lb/>of their poor <persName>Orlando</persName>! There is a ſtory in
<lb/>one of the popular periodical publications, 
<lb/>I believe in the <title ref="b:IT00954">Spectator</title>, of two lovers,
<lb/>who agreed at a certain hour to retire, each
<lb/>from their reſpective engagements, to look at 
<lb/>the moon; the romantic ſatisfaction they
<lb/>enjoyed in knowing that the eyes of the per­
<lb/>ſon beloved were, at the moment they were
<lb/>gazing on it, fixed on the ſame planet, will 
<lb/>by this means be doubled to me; for I 
<lb/>ſhall know that at ſuch an hour on ſuch
<lb/>a morning my <persName>Monimia</persName> and my <persName>Selina</persName> will
<lb/>be juſt in this place; I ſhall ſee them—I
<lb/>ſhall ſee the eagerneſs with which <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>will aſk for news of me—the pleaſure with
<lb/>which <persName>Selina</persName> will give it.—Every object

<lb/>now named <name>Monday</name>, as the morning when

<lb/>and gave as her reaſon for it, that on that
<lb/>day her mother was leſs likely to miſs her,
<lb/>from her being then particularly engaged in
<lb/>ſettling her domeſtic concerns; and that
<lb/>as they did not always certainly receive let­
<lb/>ters from the neighbouring poſt town, ex­

            <p>Poor <persName>Monimia</persName>, with a deep ſigh, reflect­

<lb/>towards them by the water, rouſed her
<lb/>from her momentary dread of future ſorrow
<lb/>to a perfect ſenſe of that which was imme­

<lb/>ſhe was to be in the parlour to make the
<lb/>tea for <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> and her aunt, and
<lb/>the neareſt way was near a mile to the

<lb/>of the danger of her ſtay—he heard her, but
<lb/>he could not anſwer.—<persName>Selina</persName>, who was al­
<lb/>moſt as fearful of being miſſed as ſhe was,
<lb/>repeated it.—<said>Come then,</said> cried <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>dejectedly, <said>ſince it muſt be ſo, let us go.</said>
<lb/>—He took one under each arm, and was

<lb/>ſwered he, ſtill in extreme agitation: <said>for

<lb/>moment is at an end—I ſuffer the tortures
<lb/>of the damned!</said> The poor girls, terrified
<lb/>at the vehemence with which he ſpoke,
<lb/>and the wild way in which he hurried on,
<lb/>made no reply, and only exerted them­
<lb/>ſelves to keep up with him. In ſilence
<lb/>they aſcended an high ſtile, which in one
<lb/>place ſeparated the park; and in ſilence
<lb/>aſcended the hill which aroſe behind the

<lb/>deſired him to ſtop—<said>We are now,</said>
<lb/>ſaid ſhe, <said>within ſight of the houſe, and

<lb/>had courage farther to oppoſe. They again
<lb/>became ſilent; and as they continued to walk
<lb/>very faſt, or rather to run, they preſently
<lb/>reached the place which <persName>Orlando</persName> had him­
<lb/>ſelf named for their parting; where <persName>Mo­

<lb/>She was gone!—he ſtood a moment like a 
<lb/>ſtatue, while her white cloaths made her
<lb/>diſtinguiſhable through the gloom.—<persName>Selina</persName>
<lb/>then entreated him to haſten home—<said>No!</said>
<lb/>he ſaid, dejectedly; <said>No, I muſt ſtay here
<lb/>till I hear the door, by which I know ſhe
<lb/>will enter the houſe, ſhut after her; and
<lb/>then I ſhall be ſure ſhe is ſafe.</said> <persName>Selina</persName>
<lb/>could not oppoſe this; it could indeed take

            <p>During ſupper the General aſſumed, as

<lb/>that to the dazzling advantages of rank and

<lb/>None of the party ſeemed much diſpoſed

<lb/>to <placeName>London</placeName>, the General demanded an audi­

<lb/>thing is more painful than the ſenſations
<lb/>which ariſe at the moment of ſeparation

<lb/>to commit. He recollected many of his
<lb/>acquaintance, whom he was willing to ſup­

<lb/>poſe much older than himſelf, who had
<lb/>married young women without half her at­
<lb/>tractions. He fancied, that he was weary
<lb/>of the diſſipated life he had hitherto led;
<lb/>that as he would ſoon be no longer a young
<lb/>man, but be <emph>declining towards</emph> middle age,
<lb/>it was time to have ſomebody who ſhould
<lb/>be truly attached to him; while his being
<lb/>married did not at all preclude him from
<lb/>gallantries, which he ſaw every body elſe
<lb/>purſue whether they were married or not.
<lb/>The greateſt inconvenience he foreſaw, was 
<lb/>what aroſe from the precipitate affection
<lb/>he had ſhewn towards his nephew, <persName>Captain
<lb/>Warwick</persName>, the orphan ſon of his ſiſter,
<lb/>whom he had taught to conſider himſelf as 
<lb/>heir to his fortune, who would be much
<lb/>mortified at the diſappointment. However,
<lb/>he reconciled himſelf to this objection, by
<lb/>reflecting that it would be very hard indeed
<lb/>if his kindneſs to his nephew ſhould pre­
<lb/>vent his gratifying himſelf; and by reſolv­
<lb/>ing to make young <persName>Warwick</persName> an immediate
<lb/>preſent of a thouſand pounds, and to ſettle a

<lb/>very handſome income upon him after his
<lb/>death, that he might not be quite thrown
<lb/>out of thoſe expectations to which he had
<lb/>been brought up, when the General ſhould
<lb/>have a family of his own.</p>
            <p>Nothing was farther from the General's
<lb/>intentions than to marry <persName>Iſabella Somerive</persName>,
<lb/>even when he had firſt changed his battery,
<lb/>and pretended to her honourable love; but
<lb/>he found ſo little proſpect of ſucceeding
<lb/>with her, even if all was to happen in her
<lb/>family as he had foreſeen, and he felt it ſo
<lb/>impoſſible to live without her, that what he
<lb/>had begun with the moſt inſidious deſigns,
<lb/>concluded at laſt in an honeſt, though an
<lb/>abſurd one: and having once taken the reſo­
<lb/>lution to commit matrimony, he endeavour­
<lb/>ed to reaſon himſelf out of every objection
<lb/>that pride, libertiniſm, or the fear of ridi­
<lb/>cule, continually raiſed againſt it. <persName>Iſabella</persName>,
<lb/>whoſe heart was perfectly free from every im­
<lb/>preſſion in favour of any other man, had ſo
<lb/>behaved as to make the enamoured Gene­
<lb/>ral believe, that only her charming reſerve,

<lb/>owing to her ruſtic education, prevented her
<lb/>avowing her attachment to his perſon;
<lb/>though, on a thouſand occaſions previous
<lb/>to his ſerious declaration, ſhe had placed his
<lb/>vanity and affectation of youth in the moſt
<lb/>ridiculous point of view, and had ſhewn
<lb/>him that ſhe did not care a ſtraw for him.</p>
            <p>But ſuch power has vanity in obſcuring
<lb/>the beſt underſtandings, that her ancient
<lb/>lover really ſuppoſed he could inſpire her
<lb/>with ſincere affection for him. Still, how­
<lb/>ever, he felt an awkward kind of ſenſation,
<lb/>when he thought of the numberleſs gay
<lb/>young men with whom his blooming <persName>Iſa­
<lb/>bella</persName> would be ſurrounded when ſhe was his 
<lb/>wife. Above all, he reflected with diſ­
<lb/>quiet on his nephew, who was reckoned
<lb/>one of the handſomeſt men of the times—
<lb/>he was three-and-twenty; and the General
<lb/>felt no ſatisfaction in being called uncle—
<lb/>Uncle! it ſounded ſo antique. <persName>Warwick</persName>,
<lb/>indeed, was never admitted to live with 
<lb/>him; and he now repented that he had pro­
<lb/>cured leave for him to come home from

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">103</mw>
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, in conſequence of a wound he
<lb/>received there, and heartily wiſhed him
<lb/>back again; but his return thither was not,
<lb/>according the General's own account, very
<lb/>likely to happen. If the preſence of <persName>War­
<lb/>wick</persName> at his own houſe in <placeName>Groſvenor Place</placeName>
<lb/>was not agreeable to him, that of <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>was as little ſo; and, though not for quite
<lb/>the ſame reaſon, for another very ſimilar.
<lb/>Before the laſt conqueſt made by <persName>Iſabella
<lb/>Somerive</persName> over the ſuſceptible heart of <persName>Ge­
<lb/>neral Tracy</persName>, at leaſt a third of it had been
<lb/>poſſeſſed by a young woman, whom he
<lb/>had purchaſed of her mother, and whoſe
<lb/>aſſumed virtue and great attractions had
<lb/>induced him to admit her into his houſe,
<lb/>where ſhe had reigned ever ſince very deſ­
<lb/>potically. As he had not yet ſettled whe­
<lb/>ther he ſhould part with her or not, or ac­
<lb/>quired courage to tell her his intentions, 
<lb/>ſhe muſt, till he could make up his mind
<lb/>on this point, remain where ſhe was; and,
<lb/>whatever might be his future reſolution,
<lb/>he did not greatly like that the handſome,

<lb/>young <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhould be introduced to
<lb/>her acquaintance. As he could not give
<lb/>this reaſon to <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> for not aſking
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> to take up his abode in his houſe,
<lb/>he had ſedulouſly avoided mentioning it
<lb/>at all. <persName>Orlando</persName> had never thought about
<lb/>it; but, occupied ſolely by what he had left,
<lb/>he conſidered not a matter ſo inconſe­
<lb/>quential as whither he was to go when he
<lb/>got to town. <persName>Tracy</persName> had once or twice
<lb/>led the converſation to topics which he
<lb/>thought would engage <persName>Orlando</persName> to say
<lb/>what he intended in this reſpect; but <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> took no notice of it, till, at length,
<lb/>juſt as they croſſed <name>Fulham Bridge</name>, <persName>Tracy</persName>
<lb/>ſaid, <said><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, ſhall my chaiſe and
<lb/>horſes put you down in <placeName>London</placeName>?—You
<lb/>know I ſtop on this ſide the turnpike, at
<lb/><placeName>Hyde-Park Corner</placeName>; but the chaiſe ſhall go
<lb/>with you wherever you pleaſe.</said></p>
            <p><said>I am much obliged to you, Sir,</said> anſwer­
<lb/>ed <persName>Orlando</persName>, who never till that moment
<lb/>recollected that the General had not invited
<lb/>him to his houſe—<said>but there is no ſort of

<lb/>occaſion to take your carriage.—I ſhall
<lb/>go,</said> added he, <said>this evening to <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Woodford's</persName>.</said></p>
            <p>That was a plan that the General did
<lb/>not quite approve of: he knew that, if his
<lb/>intended marriage was once known at that
<lb/>houſe, it would be inſtantly ſpread among
<lb/>his friends by means of the communica­
<lb/>tion <persName>Woodford</persName> had with many of their
<lb/>families, which was a circumſtance he was
<lb/>not yet prepared for. The ambition of
<lb/><persName>Woodford</persName> himſelf, and the malice and
<lb/>diſappointment of the two young ladies,
<lb/>would buſy them all in circulating the re­
<lb/>port; and the General, in love as he was,
<lb/>and determined to marry, had not yet pre­
<lb/>pared himſelf to ſtand the ironical congra­
<lb/>tulations of his male or female friends,
<lb/>but particularly the latter, on his reſolution
<lb/>of uniting himſelf in holy matrimony to the
<lb/>niece of his wine merchant. Theſe thoughts
<lb/>made <persName>Orlando's</persName> intentions of going to
<lb/><persName>Woodford's</persName>, which however he might
<lb/>eaſily have foreſeen, very unpleaſing to

<lb/>him; and he remained ſilent ſome time,
<lb/>conſidering how he might guard againſt
<lb/>the inconveniencies he apprehended.</p>
            <p>His reaſons for not giving him an apart­
<lb/>ment in his own houſe kept their ground;
<lb/>but he would very fain have prevent­
<lb/>ed his going to <persName>Woodford's</persName>, at leaſt till
<lb/>he had himſelf taken ſome means to parry
<lb/>the firſt burſt of the ridicule he ſo much
<lb/>dreaded. He could not take one very ob­
<lb/>vious means to prevent the circulation of
<lb/>the news of his intended marriage, by 
<lb/>requeſting <persName>Orlando</persName> not to ſpeak of it; for
<lb/>he had often remarked that he was quick­
<lb/>ſpirited, not without a conſiderable ſhare of
<lb/>pride, and affectionate ſolicitude for the
<lb/>honour of his ſiſters: to affect, therefore,
<lb/>making a ſecret in <placeName>London</placeName> of what he had
<lb/>ſo openly avowed in the country, could
<lb/>hardly fail of awakening the high-ſpirited
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> to ſome degree of reſentment,
<lb/>if not of doubt in regard to the reality of
<lb/>his intentions. After a long debate on
<lb/>the ſubject, the General at laſt recollected
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">that</mw>

<pb n="107"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">107</mw>
<lb/>that it was impoſſible to ſuppoſe <persName>Somerive</persName>
<lb/>himſelf would not write to a brother-in-law,
<lb/>whom he was ſo much accuſtomed to con­
<lb/>ſult, on a ſubject ſo intereſting and import­
<lb/>ant; and that, therefore, any precautions
<lb/>he might take in regard to <persName>Orlando</persName> would
<lb/>be uſeleſs. It is true that his being by his
<lb/>intended marriage allied to his own wine-
<lb/>merchant, had before given him many ſevere
<lb/>qualms, which a glance from the arch and
<lb/>bright eyes of <persName>Iſabella</persName> had at once diſſi­
<lb/>pated: but now, as he approached his town-
<lb/>houſe, and ſaw thoſe bright eyes no longer,
<lb/>theſe fits of half repentance, originating in 
<lb/>pride and prejudice, recurred with more
<lb/>force; and when he arrived at his own
<lb/>door, he ſtarted from one of the reveries
<lb/>thus brought on, and again ſaid to <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>, <said>Shall my ſervants get you a hack­
<lb/>ney coach?</said></p>
            <p>There was ſomething in the abrupt
<lb/>manner of aſking this, which ſuddenly con­
<lb/>vinced <persName>Orlando</persName> that the General had no in­
<lb/>clination to aſk him into his houſe. Piqued

<lb/>by this obſervation, he anſwered coldly,
<lb/>that there was no occaſion to trouble his
<lb/>ſervants, for that he ſhould walk to the houſe
<lb/>of his uncle, and would ſend a porter for
<lb/>the ſmall portmanteau he had in the chaiſe.
<lb/>—By this time the General's valet de cham­
<lb/>bre had opened the chaiſe-door, and <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>, who was on that ſide, got out. He
<lb/>ſtopped; and the General, as he followed
<lb/>him, aſked, in a low voice, ſome queſtion of
<lb/>one of the footmen who had been left in
<lb/>town, and who came to the chaiſe-door alſo:
<lb/>to which queſtion the man anſwered
<lb/>aloud, <said>No, Sir! ſhe is gone out.</said> The
<lb/>General, turning to <persName>Orlando</persName>, who was
<lb/>coolly wiſhing him a good evening, ſaid—
<lb/><said>You will certainly do me the favour to
<lb/>walk in?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> by this time comprehending
<lb/>that there was ſome lady uſually reſident
<lb/>with him who was not to be ſeen, and
<lb/>that he was only aſked in becauſe ſhe was
<lb/>at this time abſent, anſwered, that he would
<lb/>not then intrude upon him:—<said>but as I

<lb/>ſhall want the advantage of your inſtruc­
<lb/>tions, Sir,</said> ſaid he, <said>on many things of
<lb/>which I am totally ignorant, I ſhall be
<lb/>obliged to you to tell me where I am to
<lb/>receive your orders.</said></p>
            <p>There was a coldneſs, and indeed a 
<lb/>haughtineſs, in the manner of <persName>Orlando's</persName>
<lb/>ſaying this, that convinced the General
<lb/>he ſaw and was offended by the evident
<lb/>deſign he had himſelf formed of evading
<lb/>to give him an invitation. More diſcon­
<lb/>certed than he had almoſt ever felt in his
<lb/>life, he again preſſed him to go into the
<lb/>houſe, which <persName>Orlando</persName> again refuſed; and
<lb/>then ſaying he hoped to hear from him at
<lb/><persName>Mr. Woodford's</persName>, when and <emph>where</emph> he
<lb/>might attend him for the purpoſe of re­
<lb/>ceiving thoſe inſtructions relative to his
<lb/>future proceedings which he had promiſed
<lb/>his father to give him, he again wiſhed
<lb/>him a good evening, and walked away.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> had never been in <placeName>London</placeName> but
<lb/>once when he was about ſixteen, and had
<lb/>then only attended his mother on a viſit

<lb/>for about a week in the ſpring, which ſhe
<lb/>had paſſed with her brother. He remem­
<lb/>bered that he never was ſo happy as when
<lb/>they left it, and, on a fine evening of
<lb/><name>May</name>, returned from the ſmoke of the
<lb/><placeName>Strand</placeName>, in one of the ſtreets of which <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Woodford</persName> lived, to his dear native county,
<lb/>where only there ſeemed to be any happi­
<lb/>neſs for him. Since that time he had
<lb/>never felt a wiſh to reviſit <placeName>London</placeName>; and in
<lb/>a melancholy mood he now proceeded
<lb/>along its ſtreets, recollecting little more
<lb/>than his way from <placeName>Piccadilly</placeName> to the <placeName>Strand</placeName>.
<lb/>Every object now wore a very different
<lb/>appearance from what they did when he
<lb/>ſaw them before. It was now a dreary,
<lb/>foggy evening in <name>December</name>, and juſt at
<lb/>the hour when the inhabitants of the part
<lb/>of the town he was in were at their deſſerts,
<lb/>ſo that hardly any carriages but a few
<lb/>ſtraggling hackney-coaches and drays were
<lb/>rumbling over the pavement. As he ap­
<lb/>proached <placeName>Charing-Croſs</placeName> the buſtle became
<lb/>more; and the farther he advanced, the

<lb/>throng of coaches coming out of the city,
<lb/>and going towards the play-houſes from
<lb/>other parts of the town, deafened him with
<lb/>noiſe; but it was a mournful reflection,
<lb/>that, among all the human beings he ſaw
<lb/>around him, there was not one intereſted
<lb/>for him. While the dirt through which he
<lb/>waded, and the thickneſs of the air, filled
<lb/>him with diſguſt, his mind went back
<lb/>to the dear group at home: he ſaw them
<lb/>all aſſembled round the fire in the little
<lb/>parlour—his father trying to diſſipate with
<lb/>a book the various anxieties that aſſailed 
<lb/>him for his children, now and then com­
<lb/>municating ſome remarkable occurrence
<lb/>to his wife as ſhe ſat at her work-table:—
<lb/>he ſaw Iſabella employed in making ſome
<lb/>little ſmart article of dreſs, and fancying
<lb/>how well ſhe ſhould look in it—and <persName>Selina</persName>,
<lb/>while ſhe and <persName>Emma</persName> were aſſiſting his
<lb/>mother in completing ſome linen for him,
<lb/>more attentive to her father's reading, often
<lb/>aſking queſtions, and ſoliciting information.</p>
            <p>But when he had finiſhed this picture,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">his</mw>

<pb n="112"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">112</mw>
<lb/>his fancy, with more pain and more pleaſure,
<lb/>fled to the lovely figure of his <persName>Monimia</persName> in
<lb/>her ſolitary turret, ſighing over the tender
<lb/>recollection of thoſe hours which would
<lb/>never perhaps return, ſometimes wiſh­
<lb/>ing ſhe had never known them, but oftener
<lb/>regretting that they were now at an end.
<lb/>—He ſaw her ſtepping cautiouſly into the
<lb/>library, whenever ſhe could find it open,
<lb/>to take or to replace ſome book which they
<lb/>had read together—ſhe ſhed tears as ſhe
<lb/>read over the well-known paſſages he had 
<lb/>particularly pointed out to her—ſhe dwelt
<lb/>on the pages where he had with a pencil
<lb/>marked ſome peculiar beauty in the poetry.
<lb/>He fancied he ſaw her take out the lock of
<lb/>his hair which he had given her in a little
<lb/>cryſtal locket, preſs it to her lips, and
<lb/>then, imagining ſhe heard the footſteps of
<lb/>her aunt, return it haſtily into her boſom,
<lb/>and place it near her heart. A thouſand
<lb/>tender images crowded on his mind; he
<lb/>quite forgot whither he was going, and was

<lb/>by finding himſelf at <name>Temple-Bar</name>. Re­
<lb/>called then from the indulgence of his vi­
<lb/>ſionary happineſs to the realities around
<lb/>him, he recollected that he had paſſed the
<lb/>ſtreet where his uncle lived: with ſome
<lb/>enquiries, however, he found his way back;
<lb/>and, on arriving at the houſe, he heard
<lb/>that <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName> was out, having dined
<lb/>in the city; and that his wife and her
<lb/>daughters were gone to the play with a 
<lb/>party of friends who were to ſup with them.
<lb/>He was told, however, by the maid-ſer­
<lb/>vant who let him in, that he was expected,
<lb/>and that a bed had been prepared for him
<lb/>by direction of her maſter, who had re­
<lb/>ceived notice of his intended arrival by a
<lb/>letter from the country the day before.
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> could not help remarking to him­
<lb/>ſelf, that he was likely to have but a cool
<lb/>reception in an houſe, the inhabitants of
<lb/>which could not one of them ſtay at home

<lb/>He had never liked <persName>General Tracy</persName> much;
<lb/>and he now liked him leſs than ever, and
<lb/>regretted that <persName>Iſabella</persName> was to be his wife.
<lb/>He almoſt doubted whether he ever meant
<lb/>to make her ſo; and the idea of any decep­
<lb/>tion raiſed his indignation. But he had
<lb/>nobody to whom he could communicate
<lb/>his thoughts: and it was perhaps fortunate
<lb/>for him that he had not; for his open, un­
<lb/>guarded temper, incapable of diſſimula­
<lb/>tion, and deſpiſing it wherever it appeared,
<lb/>was very likely to have betrayed him into
<lb/>confidences with his uncle which would
<lb/>have hurt his father.</p>

            <p>The moment, however, he ſaw <persName>Wood­

<lb/>of remembering that he had not been at
<lb/>home to receive him, felt only concern
<lb/>that he was come home at all.</p>
            <p>Warm from a city dinner, the boiſterous
<lb/>manners of his uncle appeared particularly
<lb/>diſguſting to <persName>Orlando</persName>, who had lately been
<lb/>accuſtomed to aſſociate only with women,
<lb/>or with his father and the General; the
<lb/>converſation of the former of whom was pen­
<lb/>ſively mild, and that of the latter ſo ex­
<lb/>tremely courtly that he ſeemed always to

<lb/>therefore, was almoſt ſtunned with the

<lb/>that he was both; nor was he much re­
<lb/>lieved by the change in the converſation
<lb/>that brought the General's intended match
<lb/>into diſcuſſion. <persName>Woodford</persName> was at once
<lb/>flattered by such an alliance, and mortified
<lb/>that his own daughters had miſſed it. He
<lb/>felt proud that he ſhould boaſt of having
<lb/><emph>the Honourable</emph> <persName>Lieutenant General Tracy</persName>
<lb/>his nephew, but was vexed that he had
<lb/>not any ſhare in bringing it about; and
<lb/>this contrariety of ſenſations found vent in

<lb/>who was once or twice on the point of

<lb/>was a great favour, and not owing to his
<lb/>wiſh to oblige them—but to ſee how he
<lb/>liked a young woman they had with them
<lb/>from the city, and who was the only
<lb/>daughter of a rich broker of the tribe of
<lb/><name>Iſrael</name>, who had, however, married a <name>Chriſ­
<lb/>tian</name>, and was indifferent enough about his
<lb/>own religion to let his daughter be called
<lb/>a <name>Chriſtian</name> alſo. Her fortune was ſuppoſed 
<lb/>to be at leaſt ſeventy thouſand pounds;
<lb/>and <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName> had long been ſchem­
<lb/>ing to procure a match between her and
<lb/>his <persName>Jemmy</persName>:—to which <persName>Jemmy</persName> declared
<lb/>he would condeſcend, if he could but
<lb/>bring himſelf to like the girl. But he
<lb/><said>thought her confounded ugly, and had
<lb/>no notion of ſacrificing himſelf to money.</said>
<lb/>The girl herſelf, juſt come from a board­
<lb/>ing-ſchool, her head full of accompliſh­
<lb/>ments and romance, was in great haſte for
<lb/>a lover. <persName>Mr. James Woodford</persName> was reck­

            <p>The intended huſband of <persName>Maria Wood­

<lb/>of the party; who, preceded by <persName>Mrs.

<lb/>air that he imagined a man of faſhion
<lb/>would aſſume for the reception of his coun­

<lb/>felt from the obſervation that <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>who was always admired by the women,
<lb/>was much improved in his perſon ſince he

            <p>With his two female couſins <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>had never been a favourite, notwithſtand­

<lb/>for no other reaſon than becauſe he had

            <p>Having taken this reſolution for the

<lb/>no kindneſs from this family had power to
<lb/>allay, as their neglect had no power to in­
<lb/>creaſe it, went to his room little diſpoſed to
<lb/>ſleep; fatigue of body and mind gave him
<lb/>up to a few hours of forgetfulneſs. At dawn
<lb/>of morning he awoke, and, as he knew it
<lb/>would be long before any of the ſervants
<lb/>roſe in an houſe where night was converted
<lb/>into day, he dreſſed himſelf; and as the

<lb/>left a note for his uncle, ſaying, in civil but

<lb/>keep very irregular hours, and therefore
<lb/>ſhould be a troubleſome inmate in a fa­
<lb/>mily; for which reaſon he ſhould take a

<lb/>his engagements lay, and ſhould only oc­

            <p>From the coffee-houſe where he break­

<lb/>to call at his houſe. To this letter, how­
<lb/>ever, he did not expect an anſwer till after
<lb/>one o'clock, as the General was ſeldom vi­

<lb/>in pouring out his whole heart to <persName>Mo­

<lb/>of what would be thought and ſaid, when

<lb/>by thoſe whoſe intereſt it was to keep him
<lb/>ſingle; and on the other, from his fears
<lb/>of loſing <persName>Iſabella</persName>, his paſſion for whom
<lb/>abſence did not promiſe to do much
<lb/>towards curing. <persName>Warwick</persName> had been re­
<lb/>turned from his recruiting party above a 
<lb/>week, and had been ſeveral times in 
<lb/><placeName>Groſvenor Place</placeName> enquiring for his uncle;
<lb/>and the behaviour of the lady of the houſe
<lb/>towards her ancient lover was ſuch as gave
<lb/>him great reaſon to ſuppoſe that his in­
<lb/>tended reform was ſuſpected, if not known.
<lb/>Of this, however, he had no longer any
<lb/>doubt, when, going late in the evening
<lb/>after his arrival in town to the houſe he
<lb/>uſually frequented in <placeName>St. James's ſtreet,</placeName> he
<lb/>was attacked upon this tender ſubject by

<lb/>reſolution to avow it; their ridicule then
<lb/>ceaſed, and <persName>Tracy</persName> returned home, glad
<lb/>that this firſt burſt of laughter was over.</p>
            <p>But much was yet to come of a more ſe­
<lb/>rious nature, againſt which he armed him­
<lb/>ſelf as well as he could, by reflecting that
<lb/>he had a very good right to pleaſe himſelf, 
<lb/>and that neither <persName>Captain Warwick</persName>, nor
<lb/>any of thoſe other perſons to whom he
<lb/>had given a claim over him, had any other
<lb/>dependence than on his bounty. To the
<lb/>women on whom he had made ſettlements,
<lb/>he knew he muſt pay them; but whatever
<lb/>he had done for <persName>Warwick</persName> was entirely
<lb/>voluntary; and as his nephew had no other
<lb/>dependence, he would hardly, for his own
<lb/>ſake, ſo behave as to cut himſelf off from a 
<lb/>ſhare of his future fortune becauſe he could
<lb/>not have it all.</p>
            <p>Armed with theſe reflections, he deter­
<lb/>mined to end this diſagreeable ſtate at 
<lb/>once, by telling <persName>Warwick</persName> what he in­
<lb/>tended for himſelf, and for him. And

<lb/>returned to <placeName>London,</placeName> waited on him the

<lb/>he would rather have mounted a breach,
<lb/>plunged at once into the ſubject—inform­
<lb/>ed <persName>Captain Warwick</persName> of his intention to
<lb/>marry, and of the immediate preſent, as
<lb/>well as future proviſion he intended for
<lb/>him.</p>
            <p><persName>Warwick</persName>, who had always feared his
<lb/>uncle's very youthful propenſities would,
<lb/>as he advanced in life, betray him into the 
<lb/>very folly he was now about to commit,
<lb/>received this intelligence with more con­
<lb/>cern than ſurpriſe. He was himſelf of
<lb/>the gayeſt and moſt inconſiderate diſpo­
<lb/>ſition. In the height of health, youth,
<lb/>and ſpirits, the admiration of every woman
<lb/>he ſaw, and the life of every company
<lb/>he went into, his vanity did not allow
<lb/>him to ſuppoſe that he owed any part
<lb/>of that admiration to the proſpect he had of
<lb/>being heir to <persName>General Tracy's</persName> wealth;
<lb/>and, imputing it all to his own merit,
<lb/>he fancied himſelf ſuperior to the malice of 
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">fortune.</mw>

<pb n="133"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">133</mw>
<lb/>fortune. There were many poſſibilities
<lb/>which, on a moment's reflection, weakened
<lb/>the blow which this intelligence ſeemed
<lb/>at firſt to give to his faireſt hopes—His
<lb/>uncle might change his mind a day be­
<lb/>fore it was executed—the young woman
<lb/>might jilt him—or, even if the marriage
<lb/>took place, he would probably have no
<lb/>children; and then he ſhould himſelf be ſo
<lb/>little injured by this match, that it was not
<lb/>worth thinking about with any degree of 
<lb/>concern.—The thouſand pounds too, which
<lb/>his uncle promiſed him, was a douceur
<lb/>that conſiderably abated the bitterneſs of
<lb/>ſuch intelligence; and <persName>Warwick</persName>, rather
<lb/>through the careleſſneſs of his nature than
<lb/>from motives of prudence or policy, re­
<lb/>ceived this intelligence ſo much more
<lb/>calmly than <persName>Tracy</persName> expected, that his uncle
<lb/>appeared to be in a better humour with
<lb/>him than ever. This uneaſy ſubject once
<lb/>diſcuſſed, <persName>Tracy</persName> proceeded to inform him,
<lb/>that the brother of his intended bride,

<lb/><persName>Tracy</persName> hinting that ſuch were his wiſhes, 
<lb/><persName>Captain Warwick</persName> immediately offered to
<lb/>go himſelf to the young ſoldier, and give
<lb/>him every aſſiſtance and information that 
<lb/>could be uſeful to him.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of a written anſwer to
<lb/>his note, <persName>Orlando</persName> heard a gentleman en­
<lb/>quiring for him in the coffee-room; and
<lb/>on his appearing, <persName>Captain Warwick</persName>, whoſe
<lb/>figure and addreſs immediately prejudiced
<lb/>every body in his favour, introduced him­
<lb/>ſelf as the nephew of <persName>General Tracy</persName>.</p>
            <p>If <persName>Orlando</persName> inſtantly conceived a favour­
<lb/>able opinion of <persName>Warwick</persName>, <emph>he</emph> was yet more
<lb/>ſtruck with his new acquaintance. From
<lb/>his uncle's account, and from what his
<lb/>own imagination added to it, he ſuppoſed

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">135</mw>
<lb/>that he was to be a temporary bear-leader
<lb/>to a tall ſtraight-haired cub juſt come from 
<lb/>ſchool, who wanted a drill ſerjeant rather
<lb/>than a faſhionable acquaintance: but when
<lb/>he ſaw, and only for a moment had con­
<lb/>verſed with <persName>Orlando</persName>, he perceived that he
<lb/>was one of thoſe beings for whom edu­
<lb/>cation can do little, and whom nature has
<lb/>ſo highly favoured that nothing can be 
<lb/>added by art. The two young men, thus
<lb/>highly pleaſed with each other, ſoon enter­
<lb/>ed into converſation, with that unguarded
<lb/>familiarity which accompanies generous
<lb/>tempers in the candid days of youth. <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> ſpoke his mind very freely on the
<lb/>abſurdity of the match meditated by the 
<lb/>venerable General; and <persName>Warwick</persName> as freely 
<lb/>ridiculed it, while he could not help ex­
<lb/>preſſing ſome curioſity as to <persName>Iſabella</persName>, whoſe
<lb/>charms had thus brought about what ſo 
<lb/>many artful women of all deſcriptions
<lb/>had been trying at for the laſt thirty years
<lb/>at leaſt. <persName>Orlando</persName> deſcribed his ſiſter as
<lb/>he really thought her—a very handſome

<lb/>girl, full of ſpirit and vivacity, with a
<lb/>great deal of good humour—a good ſhare
<lb/>of underſtanding, which did not, however,
<lb/>exempt her from being very vain, and
<lb/>ſomewhat of a coquette. It was on enqui­
<lb/>ries relative to her perſon, which he ſaid
<lb/>muſt be extraordinary, that <persName>Warwick</persName> dwelt
<lb/>the moſt—<said>Really,</said>

<lb/>my good old uncle, or <emph>young</emph> uncle—I cry

<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> was glad to ſee that <persName>Warwick</persName>

<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> engaged him to dine at a tavern

<lb/>among whom he was called the handſome

<lb/>but hitherto without loſing his heart.
<lb/>With all his acquired imperfections, he
<lb/>retained many inherent good qualities—
<lb/>He was humane, generous, and candid:
<lb/>his ſoldiers adored him; and his friends,
<lb/>amid all that faſhionable diſſipation in
<lb/>which moſt of them lived, were more
<lb/>attached to <persName>Warwick</persName> than faſhionable men
<lb/>uſually are to any body. <persName>Orlando</persName>, in the
<lb/>ſimplicity of his heart, thought him the
<lb/>man in the world moſt calculated to be 
<lb/>his friend. <persName>Warwick</persName> was recruiting at
<lb/><placeName>Barnet</placeName>; but, however, had obtained leave

<lb/>found at <persName>Mr. Woodford's</persName>, took a lodging
<lb/>near <persName>Warwick's</persName>, and they became almoſt

<lb/>which he could not conquer, and his

<lb/>how to break, paſſed in a ſtate of mind
<lb/>by no means enviable the firſt week after
<lb/>his return to <placeName>London</placeName>; but the greateſt
<lb/>torments he was to experience had not yet
<lb/>overtaken him, for the ſocieties of faſhion­
<lb/><choice><sic/><corr>a</corr></choice>ble women, among which he had been
<lb/>the oracle, were not yet aſſembled for the
<lb/>winter. He dreaded, when he met them,
<lb/>not only the loſs of his conſequence, but
<lb/>the ſcorn and ridicule he ſhould be expoſed 
<lb/>to. He wiſhed to be once married, when
<lb/>common civility would repreſs thoſe ſar­
<lb/>caſms to which he knew he ſhould be
<lb/>otherwiſe expoſed; yet as the preparations
<lb/>neceſſary for this important event, which
<lb/>he aſſured <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> he would haſten,
<lb/>were to be begun, his reſolution failed:
<lb/>he wiſhed he had not gone ſo far, but
<lb/>had adhered to his former cruel plan,
<lb/>of waiting till the death of her father, and
<lb/>the diſtreſs and diſperſion of her family,
<lb/>which that event threatened, had thrown
<lb/>her into a ſituation in which it was likely
<lb/>ſhe might be tempted to accept leſs ho­

<milestone unit="sig" n="G11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">141</mw>
<lb/>nourable propoſals. While the mind of the
<lb/>ancient lover thus fluctuated between the
<lb/>fear of loſing her quite, and the reluc­
<lb/>tance he felt to reſign his liberty to obtain
<lb/>her, <persName>Iſabella</persName> diſcovered no impatience for
<lb/>his return; but waited for her promiſed
<lb/>dignities with tranquillity, which her father
<lb/>was far from ſharing. The painful idea
<lb/>of ſacrificing his daughter to mercenary
<lb/>conſiderations, was not more ſupportable
<lb/>than that of leaving her deſtitute, together
<lb/>with the reſt of his family, of a comfortable
<lb/>ſubſiſtence; but, above all, the cruel de­
<lb/>ſertion of his eldeſt ſon, of whom he had
<lb/>now heard nothing for many weeks, cor­
<lb/>roded his heart with unceaſing torments;
<lb/>and thoſe torments were increaſed by the
<lb/>neceſſity he impoſed upon himſelf, of con­
<lb/>cealing them as much as poſſible from<choice><sic>h </sic><corr>␣h</corr></choice>is
<lb/>wife.</p>
            <p>The letters he received from <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>were his only conſolation; yet even theſe
<lb/>were embittered, by hearing, in every one
<lb/>of them, that all his enquiries after his

<pb n="142"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">142</mw>
<lb/>brother had hitherto been fruitleſs. <persName>War­
<lb/>wick</persName>, who found great pleaſure in his
<lb/>company, had, very early in their acquaint­
<lb/>ance, learned the ſource of that anxiety
<lb/>which often clouded the open countenance
<lb/>of his friend; and, in hopes of meeting
<lb/><persName>Philip Somerive</persName>, they had gone together,
<lb/>not only to public places, and to all parts
<lb/>of them which it was likely he might fre­
<lb/>quent, but to gaming-houſes and taverns
<lb/>of the ſecond claſs, where, from <persName>Orlando's</persName>
<lb/>deſcription of his brother's ſtyle of converſa­
<lb/>tion, <persName>Warwick</persName> thought it moſt likely he
<lb/>would be found: but they gained no intel­
<lb/>ligence of him; and the very reſearch was
<lb/>not made with impunity by <persName>Warwick</persName>,
<lb/>who could ſeldom help engaging in any
<lb/>thing that was going forward. But <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando's</persName> affection for his family, and for
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, ſecured him effectually from the
<lb/>infection of ſuch ſocieties—he had ſtrength
<lb/>of mind enough to conſider how much
<lb/>he owed to them and to himſelf, and to
<lb/>reflect how unpardonable his conduct muſt

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">143</mw>
<lb/>appear to his father, if, in undertaking to
<lb/>recover his brother, he ſhould loſe himſelf.
<lb/>Theſe reflections, and an heart almoſt inſen­
<lb/>ſible of all pleaſures but what were derived
<lb/>from the hope of paſſing the ſummer of his
<lb/>life with <persName>Monimia</persName>, were antidotes even to
<lb/>the influence of <persName>Warwick's</persName> example, who
<lb/>often gaily rallied his country prejudices,
<lb/>but never ſeriouſly attempted to pervert
<lb/>his principles—and ſometimes, in their
<lb/>more ſerious converſations, was candid
<lb/>enough to own that he ſhould himſelf be a 
<lb/>happier man if he did not, rather than in­
<lb/>cur the ridicule of thoſe for whoſe opinion
<lb/>he felt only contempt, plunge into vices
<lb/>for which he had no taſte, and call purſuits
<lb/>pleaſurable, which, in fact, had not power
<lb/>to beſtow pleaſure.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> had now been three weeks in
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName>; for the plan of returning to paſs
<lb/>his <name>Chriſtmas</name> at <placeName>Wolverton</placeName>, which had
<lb/>been once propoſed, had been given up.
<lb/>The General, contented with having intro­

<lb/>no more of him ſince than common civility
<lb/>required, and was now gone to paſs that
<lb/>ſpace of time between the end of the old and
<lb/>the beginning of the new year, when it is
<lb/>very unfaſhionable to be in <placeName>London</placeName>, at the
<lb/>houſe of his brother, <persName>Lord Barhaven</persName>, who
<lb/>uſually remained at his northern reſidence
<lb/>till the end of <name>January</name>. The General had
<lb/>originally propoſed to return to <persName>Somerive's</persName>
<lb/>houſe at this time; but not having yet
<lb/>recovered the doubting qualms which he
<lb/>had ſince felt, he thought a fortnight at his
<lb/>brother's, where he hoped and believed 
<lb/>no idea of his intentions could yet have
<lb/>been heard, would give his arguments
<lb/>on both ſides fair play, which now were ſo
<lb/>equally balanced: he ſhould be alike
<lb/>removed from the faſcinating charms of
<lb/>the blooming <persName>Iſabella</persName>, and from thoſe
<lb/>rivals who, in <placeName>London</placeName>, had many eſta­
<lb/>bliſhed claims on his heart and his pocket.
<lb/>—He ſhould not, on one hand, be delight­
<lb/>ed with the ſpectacle of family happineſs
<lb/>and domeſtic comfort, which the circle at

<lb/><persName>Somerive's</persName> houſe offered to him; nor, on
<lb/>the other, dread the ridiculous light which
<lb/>the wit of his <placeName>London</placeName> friends threw
<lb/>on his intended marriage with a beautiful
<lb/>ruſtic, almoſt young enough to be his grand-
<lb/>daughter. In theſe reaſons he wrote to
<lb/><persName>Somerive</persName>, lamenting the neceſſity he was
<lb/>under to change his plan; and alleging
<lb/>that it was family engagements alone that
<lb/>impelled him to do ſo, but that as ſoon as
<lb/>they were fulfilled he ſhould haſten on
<lb/>the wings of rapture to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>,
<lb/>he ſet out for the North.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> continued another month in

<lb/>wiſhing to hear it for any other reaſon than
<lb/>becauſe it would, he thought, be the ſignal
<lb/>of their going down together to the houſe
<lb/>of his father.—At the end of that time he
<lb/>became impatient—he had been now above
<lb/>ſix weeks abſent, and the letters he had
<lb/>from his family, but ſtill more thoſe he 
<lb/>leſs frequently received from <persName>Monimia</persName>,

<lb/>of mind that every week increaſed, while
<lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> had no news of his eldeſt
<lb/>ſon, was by his letters forcibly expreſſed
<lb/>to <persName>Orlando</persName>, while his mother and his ſiſters
<lb/>gave him mournful accounts of his fa­
<lb/>ther's health. <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> letters were,
<lb/>though very rare, the greateſt alleviations
<lb/>to his uneaſineſs that <persName>Orlando</persName> received;
<lb/>for they were as expreſſive of kindneſs,
<lb/>and of increaſing attachment to him, as
<lb/>the reſerve of her manner, and the for­
<lb/>mality of her ſtyle, would permit them to
<lb/>be; and it was a great and very unuſual
<lb/>degree of favour towards any one, that
<lb/>alone could urge her to write at all. The
<lb/>two letters he received from her, there­
<lb/>fore, were conſidered by <persName>Orlando</persName> as being
<lb/>more unequivocal proofs of her ſettled
<lb/>affection for him, than any ſhe had yet
<lb/>given.</p>
            <p>Still the time when he should be per­

<lb/>ably long.—He was now in <placeName>Hertfordſhire</placeName>
<lb/>with his men; and only occaſionally ob­
<lb/>tained a few days to paſs with his friend
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> in <placeName>London</placeName>. In the tedious
<lb/>days he paſſed almoſt alone in a little coun­
<lb/>try town, his reſource was in books, and to
<lb/>ſuch as he could attain he applied himſelf
<lb/>with more avidity than he had ever done
<lb/>at the Hall. Thus paſſed the month of
<lb/><name>February</name>, and part of <name>March</name>. <persName>Mr. Some­
<lb/>rive</persName> then believing, with great appear­
<lb/>ance of reaſon, that <persName>Tracy</persName> was trifling with
<lb/>his daughter, wrote to the General in ſuch
<lb/>a way as muſt bring on a deciſion. In
<lb/>conſequence of this, the General, ſtill
<lb/>wavering, returned to <placeName>London</placeName>, from
<lb/>whence, and from his duty in <name>Parliament</name>, 
<lb/>he had abſented himſelf ſince the begin­
<lb/>ning of the ſeſſion on pretence of ill health.
<lb/>On his arrival in town a circumſtance
<lb/>awaited him, which called him back to his 
<lb/>honeſt reſolutions; for the young woman,
<lb/>on whom he had profuſely laviſhed great
<lb/>ſums of money, who was eſtabliſhed in his

<lb/>houſe, and whoſe ſettlement he had lately
<lb/>increaſed in conſequence of his propoſed
<lb/>marriage, had quitted his houſe the evening
<lb/>before that on which ſhe knew he was to 
<lb/>return to it, leaving a letter, in which ſhe
<lb/>turned him, and all her former profeſſions of
<lb/>attachment to him, into ridicule. She took
<lb/>with her all the preſents he had made her,
<lb/>to a very conſiderable amount—gave him
<lb/>the name of a perſon whom ſhe had au­
<lb/>thoriſed to receive the annual ſum he was
<lb/>to pay her—informed him ſhe was gone to
<lb/><placeName>Italy</placeName> with a young man of faſhion, whom
<lb/>ſhe named to him, and was his moſt obe­
<lb/>dient humble ſervant.</p>
            <p>As the exceſſive vanity of the General
<lb/>had blinded him ſo far, as to make him be­
<lb/>lieve he was extremely beloved by this
<lb/>young woman, who had always laughed 
<lb/>at and impoſed upon him, he was thun­
<lb/>derſtruck by an incident ſo unexpected,
<lb/>and cruelly mortified to find, that while
<lb/>he was meditating how to ſoften to her the
<lb/>pain of parting, ſhe was thinking only of
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">flying</mw>

<pb n="149"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">149</mw>
<lb/>flying from him with a younger lover. His
<lb/>reſolutions in favour of matrimony, which
<lb/>pride and the dread of ridicule had at leaſt
<lb/>ſuſpended, now returned in all their force.
<lb/>He immediately wrote to <persName>Somerive</persName>, ex­
<lb/>cuſing, as plauſibly as he could, his late
<lb/>apparent backwardneſs, and acquainted
<lb/>him that he only waited for the drafts
<lb/>of the ſettlements, which, as particular
<lb/>circumſtances in his affairs rendered much
<lb/>attention to them neceſſary, his ſolicitor
<lb/>had promiſed to have drawn up, and laid
<lb/>before two of the moſt eminent counſel—
<lb/>all which he was aſſured would not take up
<lb/>above a fortnight, at the end of which
<lb/>time he ſhould lay himſelf and his fortune
<lb/>at the feet of his adorable <persName>Iſabella</persName>.</p>
            <p>The General however, though he was now
<lb/>really in earneſt, could not prevail on the
<lb/>men of law to make a forced march in his
<lb/>favour; and the fortnight elapſed in queries
<lb/>and queſtions, by which there ſeemed no

<lb/>long robe, and the bill of attendance to the
<lb/>attorney. <persName>Somerive</persName> again thought him­
<lb/>ſelf trifled with; and the General, in order
<lb/>to convince him he was not, went down
<lb/>on a ſudden to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, where
<lb/>the charms of <persName>Iſabella</persName> regained at once
<lb/>all their power; and after ſtaying ten
<lb/>days, and renewing, in the moſt ſolemn
<lb/>manner, his engagements with <persName>Somerive</persName>,
<lb/>he returned to <placeName>London</placeName>, to make the laſt
<lb/>preparations for his marriage, which was
<lb/>fixed to be within three weeks. As it had
<lb/>long been ſettled that <persName>Orlando</persName> was then to
<lb/>return home to be preſent at the celebra­
<lb/>tion of theſe nuptials, he heard that all
<lb/>was at length ſettled, with a mixture of
<lb/>pleaſure and pain.—The delight he felt at 
<lb/>the idea of returning to friends ſo dear
<lb/>to him—above all, of ſeeing his <persName>Monimia</persName>,
<lb/>was embittered by reflecting on the ſacri­
<lb/>fice his ſiſter was about to make in this
<lb/>unequal marriage; nor could he reflect
<lb/>without regret on the injury it would do
<lb/>to the intereſts of his friend <persName>Warwick</persName>,

<lb/>who, however, ſpoke of it himſelf with

            <p>It was near the end of <name>April</name> before the
<lb/>General, who now remained ſteady to his
<lb/>engagements, could prevail upon the tardy
<lb/>ſpecial pleader, the puzzling counſel, and
<lb/>the parchment-loving ſolicitor, to com­
<lb/>plete their parts in this intended contract.
<lb/>At laſt however the General, attended
<lb/>by two of them, ſet out for <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>,
<lb/>and in a few days was followed by <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>.</p>
            <p>The day after his arrival was occupied

<lb/>or at leaſt paſſed a few agitated moments
<lb/>previous to their parting, he compared
<lb/>his preſent ſenſations with what he had
<lb/>at that time felt, and laughed at the ſu­

<lb/>on ſome former occaſions, by the gloom of

            <p>Every object, then wrapped in real and
<lb/>imaginary horrors, was now gay and joyous.
<lb/>It was a lovely glowing evening, towards
<lb/>the end of <name>April</name>.—The ſun was ſet, but
<lb/>his beams ſtill tinged with vivid colours
<lb/>the weſtern clouds, and their reflection
<lb/>gave the water of the lake that warm and
<lb/>roſeate hue which painting cannot reach.
<lb/>—The tender green of ſpring formed to
<lb/>this a lovely contraſt; and, where the wood
<lb/>of ancient pines ceaſed, his path lay through
<lb/>a coppice of low underwood and young

<lb/>thickly ſtrewn with primroſes and the ear­
<lb/>lieſt wild flowers of the year.</p>
            <p>Hope and pleaſure ſeemed to breathe
<lb/>around him—Hope and pleaſure filled the
<lb/>heart and flaſhed in the eyes of <persName>Orlando</persName>;
<lb/>and perhaps the moment when he reach­
<lb/>ed the door of the old Hall, though he
<lb/>was forced to ſtop a moment to recover
<lb/>his breath and recollection, was one of the
<lb/>happieſt in his life.</p>
            <p>It had been eſtabliſhed cuſtom, from
<lb/>his firſt admiſſion to the Hall, never to
<lb/>enter the apartment of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> but
<lb/>on permiſſion; but now, as he had inform­
<lb/>ed her from <placeName>London</placeName> that he intended to be
<lb/>at the Hall in a few days, and had receiv­
<lb/>ed an anſwer moſt cordially inviting him,
<lb/>his impatience would not permit him to
<lb/>wait for this ceremony; and he hardly felt
<lb/>the ground beneath him, as he ſprang up
<lb/>the ſtairs that led to her uſual ſitting par­
<lb/>lour, and opening the door, ſaw, by the
<lb/>faint light which the old gothic caſements

<lb/>afforded at that hour of the evening, <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName> ſitting on the opposſite window ſeat
<lb/>alone. He flew towards her, forgetting,
<lb/>at that moment, that the world contained
<lb/>any other being. Surpriſe and pleaſure
<lb/>deprived her as much of her recollection
<lb/>as they had done her lover; but it return­
<lb/>ed ſooner, and ſhe entreated him to for­
<lb/>bear thoſe frantic expreſſions of tenderneſs
<lb/>which were ſo dangerous in ſuch a place.
<lb/>—<said>Where are the old Ladies then?</said> cried
<lb/>he.—<said>They are only walking in the gal­
<lb/>lery,</said> replied Monimia, <said>as <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName> was not well enough to go out to-day
<lb/>—they will be back immediately.</said>—<said>That

<lb/>nimia</persName>, trembling at his vehemence, then
<lb/>ſighed her conſent—and hardly knowing
<lb/>what ſhe was about, gathered up the work
<lb/>that lay in the window ſeat, and ſoftly
<lb/>left the room, while <persName>Orlando</persName> walked to 
<lb/>the other end of it, aſſuming, as well as
<lb/>he was able, an air of unconcern; but be­
<lb/>fore he had made a ſecond turn <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName> entered—and ſtarted at the ſight
<lb/>of him, though ſhe had expected him

            <p>He approached her with all that affec­
<lb/>tion which is inſpired by gratitude; and as
<lb/>he reſpectfully kiſſed her hand, ſhe ex­
<lb/>preſſed her pleaſure at ſeeing him returned.
<lb/>He then paid his compliments to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName>, whoſe eyes he ſaw were thrown 
<lb/>round the room for <persName>Monimia</persName>; ſhe re­
<lb/>turned his civilities, however, with great

<lb/>to take up his reſidence at the Hall—fa­
<lb/>vours which, with unfeigned pleaſure, he
<lb/>accepted. The old Lady, who had now
<lb/>long been accuſtomed to contemplate <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> as a creature of her own forming,
<lb/>was pleaſed to fancy him improved, both
<lb/>in his perſon and his manners, during his
<lb/>ſhort abſence.—He had acquired a military
<lb/>air—he was more eaſy, but not leſs reſpect­
<lb/>ful; and ſhe fancied that he reſembled
<lb/>her grandfather's picture more than he
<lb/>uſed to do; but ſhe expreſſed ſome ſur­
<lb/>priſe not to ſee him in uniform, which ſhe
<lb/>ſaid, in her time, all gentlemen of the army
<lb/>appeared in uſually.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> promiſed he would conform
<lb/>to what ſhe thought right in that reſpect—
<lb/>not however without ſome apprehenſions,
<lb/>that as he advanced in life ſhe would pro­
<lb/>poſe to him, in order that he might be ſtill
<lb/>more like <persName>Sir Orlando Rayland</persName>, whoſe

<lb/>of which the guard ſhould be loſt in an
<lb/>immenſe ſleeve.</p>
            <p>As <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> was not very well,
<lb/>having lately had an attack of the gout,
<lb/>to which ſhe was in the ſpring particularly
<lb/>ſubject, ſhe diſmiſſed the young ſoldier
<lb/>early; and it was with inexpreſſible de­
<lb/>light that <persName>Orlando</persName> took poſſeſſion once
<lb/>more of his old apartments, which had
<lb/>been carefully prepared for him. It would
<lb/>not be eaſy to deſcribe the ſubſequent
<lb/>meeting between him and <persName>Monimia</persName>, who
<lb/>ſuffered herſelf to be perſuaded to renew
<lb/>that clandeſtine intercourſe, which they
<lb/>had both ſo often condemned as wrong,
<lb/>and renounced as dangerous; but when
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> could prevail upon him to talk
<lb/>leſs of his preſent happineſs, and to be
<lb/>more reaſonable, ſhe related to him all
<lb/>that had paſſed during his abſence.—Her
<lb/>life had, however, afforded very little va­
<lb/>riety, but was rather amended in regard
<lb/>to <persName>Mrs. Lennard's</persName> treatment of her, who

<lb/>ance on <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, in order to ſave
<lb/>herſelf trouble, gave her more liberty, and
<lb/>was rather leſs harſh towards her than
<lb/>formerly.—She related, that ſhe was now
<lb/>often ſuffered to go to church, which had
<lb/>afforded her the opportunities ſhe had
<lb/>ſnatched to meet <persName>Selina</persName> and correſpond
<lb/>with him. Her aunt had apparently for­
<lb/>gotten her ſuſpicions and anger when he
<lb/>was no longer near the Hall; and the
<lb/>diſappearance of <persName>Betty Richards</persName>, who was
<lb/>ſaid to have gone off (according to her
<lb/>own aſſertions) to <persName>Philip Somerive</persName>, and
<lb/>was reported to be ſupported by him in
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName>, had been the means of eradicating
<lb/>entirely from the mind of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>all thoſe ſuſpicions which the goſſip of
<lb/>the country, collected and repeated by the
<lb/>jealouſy of the old butler, had made on
<lb/>her mind; and ſhe now thought better of
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> than if theſe doubts had never
<lb/>been raiſed.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, in collecting this from <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>, ſaw too clearly the reaſon why his

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">160</mw>
<lb/>brother had ſo carefully avoided him; and
<lb/>amid all the delight of which his heart
<lb/>was ſenſible in this conference, it felt a
<lb/>ſharp pang, when he reflected how great
<lb/>an acceſſion of pain this intelligence, which
<lb/>did not ſeem to have reached him yet,
<lb/>would give to the already wounded heart
<lb/>of his father.</p>
            <p>Day unwelcomely appeared, and it was
<lb/>dangerous for <persName>Monima</persName> to ſtay a moment
<lb/>longer.— <persName>Orlando</persName> conducted her ſafely
<lb/>back, extorting from her a promiſe that
<lb/>they ſhould meet every night during the
<lb/>ſhort time he was to ſtay. When he left
<lb/>her his ſpirits would not allow him to
<lb/>ſleep.—The morning was delicious, and a
<lb/>thouſand birds from the woods, on every
<lb/>ſide the park, ſeemed to hail his arrival.
<lb/>Again all the enchanting viſions with which
<lb/>youth and hope had formerly ſoothed his
<lb/>mind re-appeared—never did they ſeem to
<lb/>him ſo likely to be realized. His ſan­
<lb/>guine imagination, no longer repreſſed by

<lb/>wards him, which were now every thing
<lb/>but actually declared, repreſented to him
<lb/>the moſt bewitching ſcenes of future hap­
<lb/>pineſs. The only alloy was his brother's
<lb/>indiſcretions and his father's ill health;
<lb/>but he believed he ſhould be able to
<lb/>obviate the inconveniencies of the one, and
<lb/>to reſtore the other, when he ſhould poſ­
<lb/>ſeſs, what the courſe of nature rendered
<lb/>likely to be at no great diſtance, the pro­

<lb/>to his exiſtence, and to blunt the aſperity
<lb/>of thoſe reflections in regard to his brother,
<lb/>which now and then would interpoſe and
<lb/>give him momentary diſquiet. He was
<lb/>not quite content about <persName>Iſabella</persName>, who,
<lb/>through the air of gaiety ſhe aſſumed, did
<lb/>not ſeem to be really ſo well pleaſed as ſhe
<lb/>affected to appear. The fulſome fondneſs
<lb/>of her ancient military lover ſometimes
<lb/>raiſed her ridicule, but oftener diſguſt,
<lb/>which <persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw with concern. But on
<lb/>theſe occaſions he reflected that nothing
<lb/>in this world is without its alloy; and that
<lb/>ſo many advantages would accrue to his fa­
<lb/>mily by the marriage of <persName>Iſabella</persName>, that as
<lb/>ſhe did not ſeem herſelf averſe to it, it was
<lb/>folly in him to think of it with concern.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the fourth day after

<lb/>the Hall, where <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had detained
<lb/>him to breakfaſt, and was engaged in con­
<lb/>verſation in the parlour with his father and
<lb/>the General, when a dark-coloured chariot,

<lb/>lowed by three ſervants in purple liveries.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe
<lb/>at this, as he had not the leaſt recollection
<lb/>of the equipage: their enquiry, however,
<lb/>who it could be, was immediately anſwered
<lb/>by the appearance of <persName>Doctor Hollybourn</persName>;
<lb/>who, waddling out, enquired for <persName>Mr. Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, and was ſhewn into the room where
<lb/>he was ſitting.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> was ſo little accuſtomed
<lb/>to receive viſits of civility from <persName>Doctor

<lb/>prominent ſtomach would let him, and
<lb/>whoſe ſpeeches were interlarded by all
<lb/>kinds of flattery, <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> account­
<lb/>ed for by recollecting that the Doctor
<lb/>was extremely fond of the company of
<lb/>perſons of title, and never ſo happy as

<lb/>when he could introduce ſome anecdote
<lb/>which related to his <said>brother the Biſhop,</said>
<lb/>or to ſome Right Honourable or Right
<lb/>Reverend Friend. He had on the occa­
<lb/>ſion of their meeting at <name>Rayland Hall</name> the

<lb/>upon the beauty of his brother the <persName>Lord
<lb/>Barhaven's</persName> seats; all of which, he ſaid, he
<lb/>had viſited. <persName>Somerive</persName> now therefore con­
<lb/>cluded that it was to the report of his ho­
<lb/>nourable gueſt, and of his intended alli­
<lb/>ance with the family, that he owed this
<lb/>very obliging viſit; which, however, he
<lb/>began to think very tedious, and dreaded
<lb/>its laſting till the evening: when, at
<lb/>length, the good Doctor, after a pompous
<lb/>preface, ſaid that he had an affair of ſome 
<lb/>conſequence to communicate to <persName>Mr. Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>, on whoſe time he begged to treſpaſs
<lb/>alone for ten minutes.</p>
            <p><persName>Somerive</persName>, who could not imagine what a

<lb/>mediately applied this unexpected circum­
<lb/>ſtance to the idea always preſent to his
<lb/>mind. He fancied ſome ill had befallen
<lb/>his eldeſt ſon, and that one of his friends
<lb/>had commiſſioned this man of the church
<lb/>to break to him the horrid tidings; and
<lb/>then to pour into his wounded mind the
<lb/>conſolation his profeſſion enabled him to
<lb/>beſtow.</p>
            <p>In an agony not to be deſcribed, there­
<lb/>fore, <persName>Somerive</persName> led the way into his ſtudy;
<lb/>where the Doctor, after another flouriſh­
<lb/>ing preface, which <persName>Somerive</persName> in the confu­
<lb/>ſion of his mind took for a preparatory
<lb/>diſcourſe, offered to him for <persName>Orlando</persName> his
<lb/>daughter, the fair and accompliſhed heireſs,
<lb/>to whom he declared he would give twenty
<lb/>thouſand pounds down, with an engage­
<lb/>ment that at his death that ſum ſhould be 
<lb/>trebled.</p>
            <p>Though the propoſal gave no great plea­
<lb/>ſure to <persName>Somerive</persName>, becauſe he diſliked <persName>Doc­
<lb/>tor Hollybourn</persName>, and was almoſt ſure <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> diſliked his daughter; yet this con­

<lb/>verſation, ſo different from what he ex­
<lb/>pected to hear, gave, while it relieved him
<lb/>from the moſt dreadful apprehenſions, the
<lb/>appearance of joy to his countenance: he
<lb/>thanked the conſequential Doctor for the
<lb/>honour he did his family, promiſed to com­
<lb/>municate to <persName>Orlando</persName> the purport of their
<lb/>conference, and to wait upon them with
<lb/>an anſwer, or ſend <persName>Orlando</persName> on the follow­
<lb/>ing day. They then returned to the Gene­
<lb/>ral and <persName>Orlando</persName>—the converſation turned
<lb/>on common topics; and the Doctor,
<lb/>though aſked to ſtay dinner, withdrew
<lb/>with his uſual dignity.</p>
            <p>The General was now conſidered as part
<lb/>of the family; and before him <persName>Somerive</persName>,
<lb/>who had hardly yet recovered from his ſur­
<lb/>priſe, related to <persName>Orlando</persName>, as ſoon as he was
<lb/>gone, the purport of his viſit.</p>
            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> ſeemed at firſt but little
<lb/>diſpoſed to liſten to propoſals of ſuch a 
<lb/>nature from a man whom he had always
<lb/>rather diſliked, and who now ſeemed to
<lb/>have made them, only becauſe it was ge­

<lb/>nerally underſtood that <persName>Orlando</persName> was ac­
<lb/>knowledged as the intended heir to the
<lb/>great eſtates of the <name>Rayland</name> family.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> very plainly declared his diſin­
<lb/>clination to hear of them; while the Ge­
<lb/>neral, by no means accuſtomed to conſider
<lb/>pecuniary advantages as matters to be
<lb/>ſlightly thought of, or haſtily rejected, aſked
<lb/>ſuch queſtions as led <persName>Somerive</persName> to explain
<lb/>the particulars of <persName>Miſs Hollybourn's</persName> fortune
<lb/>and expectations; after which he contrived
<lb/>to turn the converſation to indifferent
<lb/>matters for a few moments, and then
<lb/>walked away with <persName>Somerive</persName>, whom he very
<lb/>ſeriouſly adviſed to reconſider the matter
<lb/>before he ſuffered <persName>Orlando</persName> to throw from
<lb/>him this opportunity of becoming a man
<lb/>of fortune and independence.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's propoſal, however flatter­
<lb/>ing it would have been to many young
<lb/>men, even though they declined accepting
<lb/>it, gave to <persName>Orlando</persName> no other pleaſure than
<lb/>what for a moment aroſe in reflecting,

<lb/>that, in thus refuſing an affluent fortune,
<lb/>he gave to <persName>Monimia</persName> an additional proof
<lb/>of his affection. His father, however,
<lb/>after his late converſation with the General,
<lb/>and ſome reflection alone, began to ſee
<lb/>this offer in a more favourable light than
<lb/>it had at firſt appeared to him; and not­
<lb/>withſtanding the little inclination he felt
<lb/>for the family of <name>Hollybourn</name>, he was now
<lb/>of an age and under circumſtances which
<lb/>gave to ſuch a fortune as <persName>Orlando</persName> was now

<lb/>commodated itſelf to think with approba­

<lb/>when oppoſed to the preſent uncertain ſitu­

<lb/>of his mother were infinitely more formi­

<lb/>to walk with him in the ſhrubbery, while

<lb/>ſeemed to her impoſſible. She trembled

<lb/>wiſhes, yet knew enough of his invincible
<lb/>attachment to <persName>Monimia</persName> to be aſſured that
<lb/>he could never yield to them.</p>
            <p>A ſervant at length brought to <persName>Orlando</persName>

            <p>At length he was deſired to walk up

<lb/>For a man to <emph>offer</emph> his daughter—is ſuch an

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> immediately ſaw, and ſaw with

<lb/>was averſe to the alliance with <persName>Dr. Holly­

<lb/>him, which ſhe fancied his father wiſhed to

<lb/>ciouſly upon him, and ſaid, <said>I think you
<lb/>right, couſin <persName>Orlando</persName>.—<persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName>
<lb/>is to be ſure a very worthy man:—his
<lb/>daughter, they ſay, is a young perſon well
<lb/>brought up; and the fortune is very large,

<lb/>which firſt and laſt he can give her, beſides
<lb/>what he is always telling me he is to expect
<lb/>from his brother the biſhop.—But, you are
<lb/>yet a very young man, couſin; and in truth
<lb/>it ſeems to me to be time enough to think
<lb/>of marrying.—The <emph>fortune</emph> of this young
<lb/>woman is certainly very conſiderable: but,
<lb/>perhaps, not greater than at ſome time or
<lb/>other――(ſhe heſitated as if afraid of
<lb/>ſaying too much)—I ſay, by the time your
<lb/>ſettling in life is adviſable, perhaps you
<lb/>may not have occaſion to make fortune an
<lb/>object in marrying, ſo much as a good
<lb/>family.—<persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName> talks of <emph>his</emph> in­
<lb/>deed, which is not well judged; for there
<lb/><emph>are</emph> people who recollect both the Doctor
<lb/>and his brother, the biſhop, in very humble
<lb/>ſtations compared to what they are now.
<lb/>God forbid, though, that I ſhould deſpiſe
<lb/>them therefore! not at all; that is not my
<lb/>meaning—And to be ſure <emph>your</emph> family, my
<lb/>couſin, has not of <emph>itſelf</emph> much pretenſions
<lb/>to match with ancient blood――(and again
<lb/>ſhe heſitated as fearing to betray her inten­

<lb/>tions too far)—I ſay, if ever you are in a
<lb/>ſituation to marry, I would adviſe that you
<lb/>think of a woman of a good family at
<lb/>leaſt.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> waited with impatience for the
<lb/>concluſion of this ſpeech; and then falter­
<lb/>ingly and eagerly aſked of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,
<lb/>if ſhe would have the goodneſs to put

            <p>This, however, ſhe refuſed, as ſhe ſaid
<lb/><emph>ſhe</emph> would not appear to interfere in it upon
<lb/>any acount.—<said>Will you then, Madam,
<lb/>take the trouble to ſee my father?—Will
<lb/>you allow him to wait upon you?—for he
<lb/>is ſo anxious for me, and, I believe, thinks

<lb/>that he will hardly be eaſy unleſs he hears

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, impatient to have this affair
<lb/>concluded at once and for ever, now aſked
<lb/>if his father might wait upon her that after­

<lb/>was left long to conſider of it ſhe might
<lb/>change her mind as his father had done
<lb/>before, now ran to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName> with
<lb/>the utmoſt ſpeed, quite forgetting that he
<lb/>was to have dined with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, or
<lb/>that dining at all was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>When he arrived there, he haſtened to

<lb/>found together, the purport of his con­

<lb/><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> agreed to go immediately
<lb/>after dinner, though he ſeemed viſibly diſ­

<lb/>tinuing in dependence on the caprice of <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName>, and of being ſeparated from her by
<lb/>an hazardous profeſſion, might be placed at
<lb/>once in great affluence, and in the imme­

            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, finding the General was
<lb/>gone on a viſit to <name>Stockton's</name>, from whence it
<lb/>was probable he would not return till half
<lb/>an hour after four, determined to haſten to
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> before dinner. He got on
<lb/>horſeback, therefore; and, attended by 
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, on their arrival at the Hall he
<lb/>expreſſed to his ſon ſome apprehenſions
<lb/>that the lady of the houſe might be at
<lb/>dinner: but <persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe impatience
<lb/>could brook no delay, declared, without
<lb/>a very ſtrict enquiry into the hour, that it
<lb/>was not yet time, and that he was ſure they
<lb/>might go to the parlour where ſhe uſually

<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> would have ſent up a ſervant, had
<lb/>he met one; but none happened to appear,
<lb/>and he walked before his father up the ſtairs,
<lb/>and, opening the door of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName>
<lb/>ſitting room, he ſaw her at table, with <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName> on one ſide of it, and <persName>Monimia</persName> on
<lb/>the other. He would have retreated; but
<lb/>it was too late. He was already in the 
<lb/>room—his father already at the table, apo­
<lb/>logiſing to <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> for his unſeaſon­
<lb/>able intruſion. She received him with civi­

<lb/>ſtood bluſhing and trembling, and not

            <p><said>I beg I may not diſturb any body,</said><lb/>cried <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> turning his eyes

            <p><persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> again looked at <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>as ſhe left the room, and he ſaw that <persName>Or­

<lb/>upon his attachment; for the extreme
<lb/>beauty, ſweetneſs and grace of <persName>Monimia</persName>,
<lb/>ſo unlike the cherry-cheeked coarſe ruſtic

<lb/>amazed and grieved him. He felt at once,
<lb/>that a young man whoſe heart was devoted 
<lb/>to her, could never think of <persName>Miſs Holly­
<lb/>bourn</persName>, and that he himſelf could not blame 
<lb/>an attachment to an object ſo lovely, how­
<lb/>ever imprudent, or however ruinous.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> now offered to withdraw;
<lb/>but her lady bade her finiſh her dinner,
<lb/>while poor <persName>Orlando</persName> caſt a melancholy look
<lb/>after <persName>Monimia</persName>, and then on the ſeat ſhe
<lb/>had left, which <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> deſired him to
<lb/>take. The dinner was ſoon removed; and
<lb/>then <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, in a few words, repeated

<lb/>the purport of his letter. <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,
<lb/>even more ſtrongly than ſhe had done to
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, expreſſed her wiſh that the offer
<lb/>of <persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName> might be politely de­
<lb/>clined; and though ſhe evaded giving her
<lb/>reaſons for it, <persName>Somerive</persName> thought he ſaw
<lb/>them unequivocally, and that, though ſhe
<lb/>ſtudiouſly avoided declaring it, ſhe had
<lb/>determined to put <persName>Orlando</persName> into a ſituation
<lb/>in which it would be not at all neceſſary
<lb/>that he ſhould marry, for money, a woman
<lb/>to whom he was indifferent.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> had very little art; yet
<lb/>ſhe fancied herſelf a profound politician,
<lb/>and never conſidered that, while ſhe for­
<lb/>bore poſitively or even remotely to give
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> aſſurances of poſſeſſing her eſtate,
<lb/>her inſiſting upon the propriety of his
<lb/>marrying, whenever he did marry, a woman
<lb/>of <emph>family</emph>, was in effect declaring that ſhe
<lb/>meant he ſhould be the perſon who was to 
<lb/>perpetuate hers, on which ſhe put ſo high a 
<lb/>value, and thus to efface, in the illuſtrious
<lb/>blood of his poſterity, that alloy which the

<pb n="185"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">185</mw>
<lb/>inferiority of the <name>Somerives</name> had mingled
<lb/>with that of the <name>Raylands</name>.</p>
            <p><persName>Somerive</persName>, convinced of this even from 
<lb/>the pains ſhe took to conceal it, yielded 
<lb/>at once to her wiſhes, and aſſured her he
<lb/>would permit <persName>Orlando</persName> with great polite­
<lb/>neſs to decline <persName>Dr. Hollybourn's</persName> propoſal;
<lb/>yet as he continued to liſten to her ha­
<lb/>rangues upon <emph>family</emph>, he could not help
<lb/>looking ſignificantly at <persName>Orlando</persName>—looks
<lb/>which his ſon perfectly underſtood to ſay,
<lb/><said>How will this accord with your attach­
<lb/>ment to the young perſon who was this
<lb/>moment diſmiſſed by <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, as 
<lb/>one of <said rend="pre(“)" direct="false">her people</said>?</said></p>
            <p>The old Lady, however, was hardly ever
<lb/>in ſo good humour with her relations as 
<lb/>ſhe became after this affair was diſcuſſed;
<lb/>and <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> never left the houſe ſo
<lb/>full of hopes that his family would be its 
<lb/>poſſeſſors as he did after this interview,
<lb/>when he returned home in good ſpirits,
<lb/>though entirely relinquiſhing the idea of
<lb/><persName>Orlando's</persName> becoming the nephew of a biſhop.</p>

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> himſelf, though impatient to
<lb/>write and diſpatch the letter to <persName>Dr. Holly­
<lb/>bourn</persName>, yet ſtaid at the Hall to drink tea, by
<lb/>the deſire of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, who gently
<lb/>chid him for deſerting her at dinner. It
<lb/>was with more pain than pleaſure that he
<lb/>heard <persName>Monimia</persName> ſent for to make the tea,
<lb/>which had hardly happened twice within 
<lb/>the laſt three years when he was in the 
<lb/>houſe. <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> caſt a look at him
<lb/>when her Lady ordered her niece to be
<lb/>called: but ſhe could make no objection
<lb/>without raiſing thoſe ſuſpicions which ſhe
<lb/>ever appeared ſo ſolicitous to prevent.
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> then attended. <persName>Orlando</persName> treated
<lb/>her as a ſtranger, whom he was ſlightly ac­
<lb/>quainted with; and <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> did not
<lb/>appear to have the remoteſt ſuſpicion that
<lb/>he had any particular regard for her:
<lb/>ſo friendly to him, as it happened, had
<lb/>been the miſtakes and interpretations which
<lb/>the jealouſy of <persName>Pattenſon</persName> had put upon
<lb/>thoſe circumſtances that had ſo frequently
<lb/>threatened to betray him.</p>

            <p>He had ſettled with <persName>Monimia</persName>, the pre­

<lb/>and return to their uſual rendezvous; and
<lb/>their ſtolen glances during the half hour
<lb/>that they were together, in the preſence of
<lb/>the two old ladies, confirmed this appoint­
<lb/>ment.</p>
            <p>Early in the evening, then, <persName>Orlando</persName> took
<lb/>leave of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and went back to
<lb/>the houſe of his father, whoſe uncommon
<lb/>good ſpirits had diffuſed more than uſual
<lb/>gaiety among his family. <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Selina</persName> were particularly cheerful—the
<lb/>mother, becauſe ſhe ſaw her huſband for a 
<lb/>moment happy and forgetting the concern
<lb/>he continually felt about <persName>Philip</persName>, in looking
<lb/>forward to the proſperity of his brother—
<lb/>while <persName>Selina</persName>, who had trembled for the
<lb/>teaſing perſecution ſhe apprehended for
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, was delighted to find that her
<lb/>father would forbear to urge him on ſuch a 
<lb/>ſubject, and had acquired new confidence
<lb/>in the future intentions of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Iſabella</persName>, whoſe marriage was now within

<lb/>a week to take place, and who had juſt
<lb/>received from <placeName>London</placeName> ſome of thoſe ele­
<lb/>gant clothes which her father had ordered
<lb/>for her, as well as ſome magnificent pre­
<lb/>ſents from the General, was the leaſt gay
<lb/>of the party: amidſt all her endeavours to 
<lb/>perſuade herſelf that ſhe was happy, ſhe
<lb/>had of late, and particularly ſince ſhe had
<lb/>poſſeſſed theſe fineries, often enquired of
<lb/>herſelf whether they really had any power
<lb/>to beſtow happineſs. She had tried on
<lb/>her diamond ear-rings, and a valuable pearl
<lb/>neck-lace; but ſhe could not diſcover 
<lb/>that ſhe looked at all handſomer in them
<lb/>than when ſhe wore nothing but a ſimple
<lb/>ribband. The General's <foreign rend="slant(upright)" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</foreign>
<lb/>had dreſſed her hair; but ſhe thought the
<lb/>mode unbecoming to her face, and the
<lb/>beautiful dark auburn hue, which had been
<lb/>ſo much admired, was no longer diſtin­
<lb/>guiſhable. As for her intended huſband,
<lb/>he was ſo far from having made any pro­
<lb/>greſs in her affections ſince he had been re­
<lb/>ceived as ſuch, that her contempt was con­

<pb n="189"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">189</mw>
<lb/>verted into diſguſt. His ſervants had been 
<lb/>talking among thoſe of <persName>Somerive</persName>, of his
<lb/>gallantries, and, above all, of the ſudden
<lb/>deſertion of the lady who lived with him;
<lb/>of all which <persName>Iſabella</persName> had heard from her
<lb/>maid, and the longer ſhe liſtened to, or
<lb/>thought of the anecdotes thus collected,
<lb/>the greater became her repugnance; and
<lb/>yet ſhe knew not how to retract, and was
<lb/>not always ſure that ſhe wiſhed it.</p>
            <p>Her gravity was eaſily accounted for, as
<lb/>the day approached that was to divide her
<lb/>from her family; and ſhe was ſuffered, after
<lb/>ſome gentle raillery, to be ſilent and penſive
<lb/>amidſt the cheerful converſation of the reſt.</p>
            <p>It was a lovely evening in early <name>May</name>.
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, having diſpatched his letter, diſ­
<lb/>miſſed <persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName> and the diſagree­
<lb/>able heireſs from his mind, and gave it up
<lb/>only to pleaſurable impreſſions and flatter­
<lb/>ing hopes. In a happier frame of mind
<lb/>than he almoſt ever was in before, he
<lb/>joined his family in their evening walk.
<lb/>When they reached the houſe, they ſtopped

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">190</mw>
<lb/>in the court before it, to admire the beauty
<lb/>of the moon, and to liſten to the night­
<lb/>ingale, who ſeemed to be addreſſing to that
<lb/>beautiful planet her plaintive oriſons. <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> wiſhed himſelf with <persName>Monimia</persName>; and 
<lb/>thought with delight that within two hours
<lb/>he ſhould be ſo, and ſhould relate the
<lb/>unpleaſant alarm of the day, only to tell
<lb/>her it was over, and had eventually been
<lb/>fortunate in drawing from <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>declarations more than ever favourable to
<lb/>his future hopes.</p>
            <p>The whole party ſat down to ſupper in
<lb/>this cheerful diſpoſition. The General, like
<lb/>a happy lover, was particularly animated;
<lb/>and the younger girls were much amuſed
<lb/>by ſome anecdotes he was relating, when a 
<lb/>ſervant entered haſtily, and ſaid that a
<lb/>gentleman who was juſt come poſt from
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName> deſired to ſpeak to <persName>General Tracy</persName>.</p>
            <p><said>To me!</said> cried the General, changing
<lb/>countenance: <said>Impoſſible! I know no
<lb/>buſineſs any one can have with me that
<lb/>ſhould give him that trouble. Pray, en­
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">quire</mw>

<lb/>quire his name, or ſend my ſervants to
<lb/>enquire.</said></p>
            <p><said>I will go myſelf, General,</said> ſaid <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>. <said>I thank you,</said> cried <persName>Tracy</persName>, af­
<lb/>fecting great unconcern; <said>but I dare ſay
<lb/>it is nothing worth your troubling yourſelf
<lb/>to go out for.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, however, went out, and in­
<lb/>ſtantly returned bringing with him <persName>Cap­
<lb/>tain Warwick</persName>.</p>
            <p>Surpriſe was viſible on the faces of all
<lb/>the party, but that of <persName>General Tracy</persName> ex­
<lb/>preſſed conſternation—<emph>Why</emph> <persName>Warwick</persName> came
<lb/>he could not conjecture; but he felt it to 
<lb/>be extremely diſagreeable to him that he
<lb/>came at all. <persName>Warwick</persName> was covered with
<lb/>duſt, and had that wild and fatigued look
<lb/>that announces tumult of ſpirit from an 
<lb/>hot and rapid journey. The perſon, how­
<lb/>ever, that nature had given him, was ſuch
<lb/>as no diſadvantageous circumſtance could
<lb/>obſcure. He looked like a young hero
<lb/>juſt returned unhurt from the field to re­
<lb/>count its triumphs.</p>
            <p>After addreſſing his uncle, and being in­

<lb/>troduced to <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, he
<lb/>turned gaily to <persName>Orlando</persName>, and, ſhaking him
<lb/>by the hand, ſaid, <said>I don't know, my
<lb/>friend, how you can ever forgive the man
<lb/>whoſe fortune it is to announce to you that
<lb/>you muſt quit immediately ſuch a circle of
<lb/>friends as I now find you in!</said></p>
            <p><said>Quit them!</said> exclaimed <persName>Mrs. Some­
<lb/>rive</persName>. <said>Quit us! leave us!</said> cried her
<lb/>huſband.—<said>Yes, indeed!</said> anſwered <persName>War­
<lb/>wick</persName> with leſs vivacity: <said>That part of
<lb/>our regiment which is in <persName>England</persName>, con­
<lb/>ſiſting of two companies, is ordered to join
<lb/>the troops that are going thither, and are
<lb/>to ſail from <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName> next week. The
<lb/>moment I was ſure of this, which was not
<lb/>till late laſt night, I thought it beſt to
<lb/>come down myſelf; becauſe the time is
<lb/>ſo ſhort that my friend here, the young
<lb/><seg xml:id="a03" corresp="#n03" rend="post(*)">ancient</seg>, had better proceed immediately 
<lb/>from hence to <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName>.</said></p>
            <p>Never was a greater, a more ſudden
<lb/>change, than theſe few words made in the
<lb/>diſpoſitions of all preſent—except <persName>Tracy</persName>,

<lb/>by the cruel idea of loſing <persName>Orlando</persName>, retired
<lb/>in ſilent tears; and her daughters, little leſs
<lb/>affected, followed her. <persName>Somerive</persName> bore this
<lb/>painful intelligence with more apparent
<lb/>fortitude; but he felt it with even greater
<lb/>ſeverity, and with ſomething like a pre­
<lb/>poſſeſſion that he ſhould never ſee <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>again if he left <placeName>England</placeName>. He ſtifled, how­
<lb/>ever, his emotions, and endeavoured to do
<lb/>the honours of his houſe to his unexpected
<lb/>viſitor; but the effort was too painful to be
<lb/>long ſupported, and in a few moments
<lb/>he left the room, ſaying to <persName>Orlando</persName>, that
<lb/>as the General and <persName>Captain Warwick</persName> might
<lb/>perhaps have ſome buſineſs, they would

            </p>
            <p>He put his hands on his heart, as if he
<lb/>really felt there the incurable wound he
<lb/>deſcribed bleed afreſh. <persName>Orlando</persName>, conceal­
<lb/>ing his own concern as well as he could,
<lb/>endeavoured to ſooth his father, by repre­
<lb/>ſenting to him that this was always likely

<lb/>hope that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> might interpoſe to

<lb/>in the morning, before he is, like <persName>Lord

<lb/>dear <persName>Warwick</persName>! and what is worſe, you

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> then gave his light-hearted
<lb/>friend directions to find his way back, and
<lb/>when he left him, advanced ſlowly towards
<lb/>the houſe, from which he was not above
<lb/>three hundred yards diſtant.</p>
            <p>His mind, which had been at firſt diſ­
<lb/>tracted by the diſtreſs of his father, and
<lb/>ſince haraſſed by the ill-timed raillery
<lb/>of his friend, now returned to thoſe bitter
<lb/>reflections which aroſe from the certainty
<lb/>of his being immediately to take a long
<lb/>leave of <persName>Monimia</persName>, and under the cruel ne­
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ceſſity</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">208</mw>
<lb/>ceſſity of telling her ſo. But a few hours
<lb/>ſince he looked forward to the pleaſure
<lb/>of meeting <persName>Monimia</persName> with only tidings
<lb/>of ſatisfaction and hope; now, he was to
<lb/>meet her, only to tell her that they were to
<lb/>part ſo ſoon, never perhaps to meet again!</p>
            <p>He now entered his Study (for one of
<lb/>the ſervants ſat up to let him in), and en­
<lb/>deavoured to collect himſelf enough to
<lb/>communicate what he had to ſay to <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>, without too much ſhocking her.
<lb/>But when he thought that their next meet­
<lb/>ing might be the laſt they ſhould ever
<lb/>have, his own courage forſook him, and he
<lb/>dreaded leſt he ſhould be quite unable to 
<lb/>ſuſtain hers.</p>
            <p>The hour ſoon came when he knew ſhe
<lb/>expected him; and he trembled as he led
<lb/>her down the ſtairs. At length, ſince it
<lb/>was impoſſible to diſguiſe from her thoſe
<lb/>emotions which agitated his mind, he re­
<lb/>lated to her all the occurrences of the
<lb/>eventful day, and the neceſſity there was
<lb/>for his preparing himſelf the next day, and

<lb/>taking leave of this part of the country the
<lb/>day following.</p>
            <p><persName>Monimia</persName> could not ſhed tears; her heart
<lb/>ſeemed petrified by the greatneſs and
<lb/>ſuddenneſs of the blow, which fell with
<lb/>more force, becauſe their laſt interview
<lb/>had been ſo little embittered by fears or
<lb/>broken by alarms. When, however, <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> explained to her, that his honour
<lb/>would be irreparably injured if he even
<lb/>expreſſed any reluctance to enter on the
<lb/>active parts of the profeſſion he had en­
<lb/>gaged in, and that to attempt diſengaging 
<lb/>himſelf now would be a blemiſh on his cha­
<lb/>racter from which he could never recover,
<lb/>her good ſenſe, and her true tenderneſs for
<lb/>him, gave her ſome degree of compoſure,
<lb/>and even of reſolution. As he declared
<lb/>that he felt nothing ſo ſeverely as leaving
<lb/>her—leaving her unprotected, and almoſt
<lb/>alone in the world, ſhe nobly ſtruggled
<lb/>to conceal her own anguiſh, that ſhe might
<lb/>not aggravate his; and, ſince his going
<lb/>was inevitable, endeavoured not to depreſs,

<lb/>by her fears, that ſpirit with which it was
<lb/>neceſſary for him to go.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, as much charmed by her ſenſe
<lb/>as her affection, became aſhamed of be­
<lb/>traying leſs tender reſolution than a timid
<lb/>uninformed girl. She taught him how to
<lb/>repreſs his concern; and this interview,
<lb/>inſtead of increaſing his regret, fortified his
<lb/>mind againſt it. <persName>Monimia</persName> remained with
<lb/>him a leſs time than uſual—with faltering
<lb/>lips he entreated her to meet him again the
<lb/>next night, becauſe it would be the laſt.—

<lb/>tired to his bed, where ſleep abſolutely
<lb/>refuſed to indulge him with a few hours
<lb/>of forgetfulneſs till towards morning.</p>
            <p>When he had told <persName>Warwick</persName> that he
<lb/>ſhould be at his father's houſe early in the
<lb/>morning, he forgot that he ſhould be
<lb/>detained by the neceſſity he was under to
<lb/>attend <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>. He ſent up for
<lb/>permiſſion to wait upon her at breakfaſt,
<lb/>which was immediately granted; and he

<lb/>opened to her, as ſoon as he was admitted,
<lb/>the reaſon of this early viſit, and the ne­
<lb/>ceſſity he was under to take leave of her
<lb/>the next day, to join his regiment in <placeName>Ame­
<lb/>rica</placeName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> expreſſed more ſurpriſe
<lb/>than concern at this information: accuſtom­
<lb/>ed, from early impreſſions, to high ideas of
<lb/>the military glory of her anceſtors, and
<lb/>conſidering the <name>Americans</name> as rebels and
<lb/>round heads, to conquer them ſeemed to
<lb/>her to be not only a national cauſe, but
<lb/>one in which her family were particularly
<lb/>bound to engage.—She had contemplated
<lb/>only the honours, and thought little of the 
<lb/>dangers of war. The trophies that ſur­
<lb/>rounded the picture of her warlike grand­
<lb/>father <persName>Sir Orlando</persName>, and the honourable
<lb/>mention that was made of his proweſs
<lb/>in the family annals, ſeemed to her ample
<lb/>compenſation for a wound in his leg, which
<lb/>had made him a little lame for the reſt
<lb/>of his life. Of <persName>Orlando's</persName> perſonal danger,
<lb/>therefore, ſhe had, as he expected, no ap­

<lb/>prehenſions, and was rather deſirous he
<lb/>ſhould juſtify her partiality to him, by
<lb/>emulating the fame of the heroes of her
<lb/>family, than afraid of what might happen
<lb/>in the experiment.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> parted from him in high
<lb/>good humour, deſired he would give her
<lb/>as much time as he could the next day,
<lb/>and ſet out from the Hall rather than from
<lb/><placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName> when he went to <placeName>Portſ­
<lb/>mouth</placeName>; all which <persName>Orlando</persName> readily pro­
<lb/>miſed, and then, with a heavy heart, went
<lb/>to the houſe of his father.</p>
            <p>That capricious fate which ſeemed to be
<lb/>weary of the favours ſhe had long been 
<lb/>accumulating on the head of <persName>General Tracy</persName>,
<lb/>appeared now determined to diſcard him,
<lb/>as ſhe is often ſaid to do her ancient fa­
<lb/>vourites. A more malicious trick than that
<lb/>ſhe now meditated, could hardly befall any
<lb/>of them—The General had long kept off,
<lb/>by art, an attack of the gout, a diſeaſe
<lb/>to which he did not allow himſelf to be

<lb/>long walk of the preceding evening, or the
<lb/>tumult of his ſpirits on his approaching
<lb/>nuptials, or the ſudden ſight of his nephew,
<lb/>that occaſioned an unlucky revulſion, cer­
<lb/>tain it is that, in the middle of the night, he
<lb/>was awakened by this moſt inexorable diſ­
<lb/>eaſe peremptorily telling him, in more than
<lb/>one of his joints, that the viſit would be
<lb/>more oppreſſive by having been ſo long
<lb/>delayed. His valet de chambre was haſtily
<lb/>ſummoned, with ſuch applications as, how­

<lb/>attacks; but it was to no purpoſe the

<lb/>life to preſerve his activity; the morning
<lb/>found him a cripple, compelled to yield,
<lb/>with whatever reluctance, to the old reme­
<lb/>dies of patience and flannel. This cir­
<lb/>cumſtance, ſo very mal-apropos, appeared
<lb/>yet more terrible to the General, when he
<lb/>reflected that <persName>Warwick</persName>, the formidable

<lb/>his bodily ſufferings, <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName>, in­

            <p>The three girls were at work in the

<lb/>He obſerved ſomething very unuſual in the

            <p>They went together into the avenue:

<lb/>To have the power of taking with him his
<lb/>adored <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſecure of a preſent ſup­
<lb/>port for her, and certain that with him ſhe
<lb/>would be happy in any country, was a 
<lb/>temptation it was almoſt impoſſible to re­
<lb/>ſiſt: when he conſidered on the other hand,
<lb/>the pain of being ſeparated from her, for
<lb/>a long, perhaps an eternal abſence, and
<lb/>of leaving her to the mercy of ſuch a wo­
<lb/>man as <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, who might, either
<lb/>by withdrawing her protection, or render­
<lb/>ing it an intolerable bondage, drive the
<lb/>lovely orphan alone and friendleſs into a 
<lb/>cruel world; other means of ſaving her he
<lb/>had none, and neither the laws of God or
<lb/>man were againſt thoſe which were now ſo
<lb/>unexpectedly offered him.</p>
            <p>But his father, already broken-hearted
<lb/>by the deſertion of one of his children,
<lb/>would be hurried to the grave by thus be­
<lb/>ing deceived by two others. His mother
<lb/>would be rendered wretched, and he ſhould
<lb/>perhaps accuſe himſelf as being acceſſary
<lb/>to the death of both his parents:—the

<lb/>thought was not to be borne. He de­
<lb/>termined for a moment to renounce every
<lb/>happineſs which muſt be purchaſed by
<lb/>their miſery, and not only to fly himſelf
<lb/>from this almoſt irreſiſtible temptation,
<lb/>but to prevent <persName>Iſabella</persName> from yielding to it.
<lb/>But this reſolution was hardly formed,
<lb/>before the image of <persName>Monimia</persName> weeping in
<lb/>ſolitude her deſolate fate, complaining to
<lb/>him, who was too far off to hear—ill-treatred
<lb/>or abandoned by her aunt—expoſed to the
<lb/>inſults of the profligate, and the contempt
<lb/>of the fortunate—came with all its pathetic
<lb/>intereſt to win him from his duty; and
<lb/>then, the happineſs of calling her his—of
<lb/>knowing that only death could divide
<lb/>them! the conteſt was dreadful; and he
<lb/>knew that when he ſaw <persName>Monimia</persName> it would 
<lb/>be worſe.—Once or twice he determined to
<lb/>put an end to it, by telling his father; but
<lb/>to this deſperate expedient was oppoſed
<lb/>the honour he had given to <persName>Warwick</persName> not
<lb/>to betray, if he would not participate, the
<lb/>intended flight of his ſiſter; nor did he
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">imagine</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">225</mw>
<lb/>imagine that her going off with <persName>Warwick</persName>
<lb/>would be a very diſtreſſing circumſtance
<lb/>to his father.—However enraged the Gene­
<lb/>ral might at firſt be, his pride would not
<lb/>ſuffer him finally to abandon his nephew.
<lb/>In every point, but that of preſent fortune,
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> muſt have the preference; and
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> thought that he had often ſeen,
<lb/>by his father's countenance as he looked 
<lb/>at <persName>Iſabella</persName>, that he regretted the ſacrifice
<lb/>he was induced by his own circumſtances
<lb/>to promote.—But with himſelf it was quite
<lb/>otherwiſe; and the raſh ſtep he was thus
<lb/>ſtrongly tempted to take, would blaſt at
<lb/>once all thoſe hopes his father now ſo
<lb/>fondly cheriſhed in regard to the <name>Rayland</name> 
<lb/>eſtate (for it was certain <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>would never forgive him); and, by acced­
<lb/>ing to <persName>Warwick's</persName> propoſal, he muſt deeply
<lb/>aggravate every pang of that ſeparation
<lb/>which his father ſeemed already unable to

<lb/>continued for ſome moments to traverſe

<lb/>His two younger ſiſters appeared to inter­

<lb/>He learned from them that <persName>Captain War­

<lb/>A new doubt now aroſe in the mind of
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>—Ought he to communicate to
<lb/><persName>Selina</persName> what was going forward, of which
<lb/>ſhe appeared to be ignorant? or conceal
<lb/>within his own boſom what he could not

<lb/>endeavoured to diſſemble as well as he
<lb/>could the conflict of paſſions which were
<lb/>preying on his heart. His father pale and
<lb/>dejected, with a ſlow and languid ſtep,
<lb/>ſoon after joined them: he bade the two
<lb/>girls go to their mother, and then taking
<lb/><persName>Orlando's</persName> arm, they walked together to a

<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>diſcuſs that any more; I
<lb/>would not marry <persName>Miſs Hollybourn</persName>, if ſhe

            <p>

            </p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> ſtarted as if he had trod on a 
<lb/>ſerpent: this was a ſtring that jarred too
<lb/>much, it threatened to deſtroy all the vir­
<lb/>tuous reſolutions which he had been la­
<lb/>bouring to adopt; for it ſeemed to be cru­
<lb/>elty and injuſtice in his father to reproach
<lb/>him; and, conſcious of the ſacrifice he 
<lb/>hoped to have fortitude enough to make,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">229</mw>
<lb/>it appeared too hard that he was at 
<lb/>that moment blamed for not making 
<lb/>more.</p>
            <p><said>No, Sir,</said> ſaid he, <said>I will not give
<lb/>up my fancy for the girl at the Hall, as
<lb/>you are pleaſed to term her; but I ſee not
<lb/>how my affection for her can injure my
<lb/>family, nor how my reſigning her could
<lb/>ſave them—For God's ſake, do not embitter
<lb/>the few hours we are to paſs together,
<lb/>either by reproaches which indeed I do not
<lb/>deſerve, or by concern which the occaſion
<lb/>does not demand. Believe me, your ſon
<lb/>ſuffers enough, without the additional mi­
<lb/>ſery of ſeeing you either diſpleaſed with
<lb/>him or grieving for him.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, then fearful that any farther
<lb/>converſation with his father, in the humour
<lb/>he ſeemed to be in, would ſerve only to
<lb/>give pain to them both, and wiſhing to be 
<lb/>alone for a few minutes before he again ſaw
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName>, went another way; and on his
<lb/>return to the houſe he found an official 
<lb/>letter directing him to repair immediately

<lb/>for <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName>, where the captain of his
<lb/>company was aſſembling his men in order
<lb/>to embark immediately for <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Thus certain that he muſt ſet out
<lb/>the next day, and that he had only a few
<lb/>moments before he muſt meet <persName>Warwick</persName>
<lb/>and give his anſwer, he hid himſelf in the
<lb/>leaſt frequented part of the ſhrubbery that
<lb/>adjoined to the houſe, and again conſidered
<lb/>of the tempting offer that was made
<lb/>him. Faſcinating as it was, and though
<lb/>his exceſſive affection for <persName>Monimia</persName> was
<lb/>often on the point of overbalancing every
<lb/>other conſideration whatever; his pride
<lb/>and his duty, his affection for his father,
<lb/>and his reſpect for himſelf, united at length
<lb/>to conquer his inclination. How could he
<lb/>bear to plunge a dagger into the heart of
<lb/>his father, who had little other hope on
<lb/>earth but in him? or, if he could determine
<lb/>on that, and fortify himſelf againſt the re­
<lb/>proaches his conſcience might make him,
<lb/>how could he ſubmit to be obliged for his
<lb/>ſupport, for the ſupport of <persName>Monimia</persName>, to
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">Warwick?</mw>

<pb n="231"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">231</mw>
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName>? There was ſomething repug­
<lb/>nant to the generous feelings of <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>in <persName>Warwick's</persName> uſing the very money his
<lb/>uncle had given him, as the means of diſ­
<lb/>appointing his benefactor. But, whatever
<lb/>apology <persName>Warwick</persName> might make to himſelf
<lb/>for this, <persName>Orlando</persName> thought there could be
<lb/>none for him if he were to participate in
<lb/>money thus acquired. He knew that, ac­
<lb/>cuſtomed to expence and to indulgencies
<lb/>as his friend was, a thouſand pounds would
<lb/>be no very permanent reſource when
<lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> was to ſhare it: and he could not
<lb/>bear that <emph>he</emph> ſhould be ſuppoſed to connive
<lb/>at her flight, only to become with <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>a burthen to her and <persName>Warwick</persName>. On the
<lb/>ſlender pay of an enſign it were madneſs
<lb/>to think he could ſupport a wife, however
<lb/>humble might be her wiſhes; and his mar­
<lb/>riage would cut him off for ever from all
<lb/>hopes of that aſſiſtance from <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>,
<lb/>which his father, even though he ſhould
<lb/>forgive, had not the power to afford him.
<lb/>Could he then endure to expoſe his beloved
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">Monimia</mw>

<pb n="232"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">232</mw>
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> to the inconveniences of follow­
<lb/>ing a camp, without having the means of 
<lb/>procuring her ſuch alleviations as it al­
<lb/>lowed? He might die in the field, and
<lb/>leave her expoſed to hazards infinitely
<lb/>greater than thoſe which could befall her 
<lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>. This laſt conſideration deter­
<lb/>mined him—It decided his wavering virtue,
<lb/>and he reſolved to give <persName>Warwick</persName> a poſitive
<lb/>refuſal immediately before he ſhould relapſe,
<lb/>and to conceal the almoſt invincible temp­
<lb/>tation he had been under from his <persName>Moni­
<lb/>mia</persName>, leſt, her weaker, ſofter heart yielding
<lb/>to it, he ſhould again find himſelf unable 
<lb/>to reſiſt it.</p>
            <p>He now haſtened to find <persName>Warwick</persName>; and
<lb/>fortunately met him at the entrance of the
<lb/>houſe, whither they were now ſummoned
<lb/>to dinner. <persName>Warwick</persName> enquired with great
<lb/>eagerneſs on what he had reſolved. <said>To
<lb/>be miſerable,</said> anſwered <persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>in
<lb/>abſtaining from what is wrong. I ſhould be

<lb/>either way I muſt be unhappy, to be ſo
<lb/>with integrity rather than ſelf-reproach.</said></p>
            <p><said>What the devil!</said> ſaid <persName>Warwick</persName>,
<lb/><said>you won't go then my way?</said></p>
            <p>
              <said>No, I will not.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>But you will not, I hope, Sir,</said> cried
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> half angry—<said>you will not think
<lb/>it neceſſary to prevent your ſiſter?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, who did not greatly reliſh the
<lb/>peremptory manner in which this was ſaid,    
<lb/>anſwered coldly—<said>You have my honour,
<lb/><persName>Captain Warwick</persName>, and any other queſtion
<lb/>is an affront.</said></p>
            <p><said>Forgive me, my friend,</said> replied
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName>, reſuming his uſual good-hu­
<lb/>mour—<said>forgive me for doubting you.
<lb/>I cannot live without <persName>Iſabella</persName>, nor do I in­
<lb/>tend to try at it—I have prevailed upon her,
<lb/>not without difficulty I aſſure you, to con­
<lb/>ſent to meet me at <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName>.—You
<lb/>know how much happineſs your going with
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> would have given to us all!—
<lb/>But I have not a moment to argue the
<lb/>matter with you.—You ſay you are deter­

<lb/>mined—So am I; and all I aſk of you is,
<lb/>that you will not rob me of my happineſs,
<lb/>upon the ſame falſe, cold ſort of reaſoning
<lb/>ſyſtem to which you are ſacrificing your
<lb/>own.</said></p>
            <p>A ſervant now coming out to ſay that
<lb/>dinner waited, they went into the houſe.
<lb/>A melancholy and ſilent meal was ſoon
<lb/>concluded. The General's horſe was
<lb/>brought to the door, on which <persName>Warwick</persName>
<lb/>was to go to the next poſt town: and
<lb/>he roſe to take leave of the family, which
<lb/>he did with a compoſure that amazed <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName>, who had no idea how a man could
<lb/>ſo conceal the feelings which muſt on ſuch
<lb/>an occaſion naturally ariſe. <persName>Iſabella</persName> was
<lb/>far from appearing ſo tranquil; but all the
<lb/>reſt were too much engaged with their own
<lb/>ſenſations to remark thoſe which her coun­
<lb/>tenance betrayed, though to <persName>Orlando</persName> her
<lb/>confuſion was evident.</p>
            <p><persName>Warwick</persName> went up to receive the laſt
<lb/>orders of his uncle, and then prepared to
<lb/>mount his horſe; when <persName>Orlando</persName> took his
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">arm,</mw>

<pb n="235"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">235</mw>
<lb/>arm, and begged he would ſend the ſervant
<lb/>on with the horſes, and give him a few
<lb/>moment's attention as they walked on
<lb/>after them.</p>
            <p><persName>Warwick</persName> readily agreed, in hopes that
<lb/>he had changed his mind; but <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>ſoon put an end to ſuch expectations by
<lb/>aſking him in what way <persName>Iſabella</persName> was to
<lb/>meet him.—<said>I have given you my
<lb/>honour, <persName>Warwick</persName>,</said> ſaid he, <said>not to be­
<lb/>tray you: but I muſt have yours in return
<lb/>that my ſiſter ſhall be expoſed to no im­
<lb/>proper adventures. How is ſhe who never
<lb/>was from home in her life, but for a few
<lb/>days with her mother in <placeName>London</placeName>, to find
<lb/>her way to <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName>?</said></p>
            <p><said>Ridiculous!</said> exclaimed 
<persName>Warwick</persName>, <said>to 
<lb/>find her way to <placeName>Portſmouth!</placeName> One would
<lb/>really think ſhe was to take a flight to the
<lb/>extreme parts of the earth, inſtead of 
<lb/>hardly five-and-thirty miles.—My poor
<lb/>friend, thou haſt not been uſed, I ſee, to
<lb/>theſe little adventures—I have an aid de
<lb/>camp, who, in the abſence of his com­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">236</mw>
<lb/>mander, can ſecure a little deſerter for
<lb/>him.—<persName>Iſabella</persName> is determined to truſt me;
<lb/>and it may ſuffice you to know that I love
<lb/>her too well not to take every poſſible pre­
<lb/>caution for her ſafety.</said></p>
            <p><said>No,</said> ſaid
<persName>Orlando</persName>, <said>it may <emph>not</emph>
<lb/>ſuffice—Though I have promiſed not to in­
<lb/>terfere, it is only on condition that I am
<lb/>ſure my ſiſter will not ſuffer either in her
<lb/>perſon or her reputation. Give me there­
<lb/>fore the particulars.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Warwick</persName> then related, that his ſervant, on
<lb/>whom he could depend, was on the even­
<lb/>ing they ſhould appoint to be ready with
<lb/>a poſt-chaiſe and four at ſome place they
<lb/>could fix upon; where after ſupper <persName>Iſa­
<lb/>bella</persName>, inſtead of retiring to her room,
<lb/>ſhould meet it—<said>Nothing is more eaſy,
<lb/>I ſuppoſe,</said> ſaid <persName>Warwick</persName>, <said>or leſs danger­
<lb/>ous, than for your ſiſter to do this; and,
<lb/>when ſhe is once off in the chaiſe, relays of 
<lb/>horſes being ordered at the two ſtages 
<lb/>between this and <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName>, my ſervant,
<lb/>following on horſeback, will eſcort her
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">thither</mw>

<pb n="237"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">237</mw>
<lb/>thither in leſs than four hours: there I 
<lb/>ſhall have a veſſel ready to carry us to
<lb/><placeName>Jerſey</placeName>—Money, my dear boy! Money,
<lb/>my dear boy! Money, contrivance and
<lb/>courage are all that are neceſſary.—I have 
<lb/>found the two firſt, and have given the laſt 
<lb/>to the only perſon that wanted it.—I have
<lb/>convinced <persName>Iſabella</persName> that, if ſhe follows my
<lb/>directions, ſhe may be at <placeName>Portſmouth</placeName> be­
<lb/>fore ſhe is miſſed, and married before any
<lb/>one can gueſs where to look for her.—Well,
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, you now have my whole plan;
<lb/>and I truſt to your honour not to render it
<lb/>abortive.</said></p>
            <p><said>And I,</said> replied <persName>Orlando</persName>, 
<said>truſt my
<lb/>ſiſter to yours, not without reluctance and
<lb/>remorſe—We ſhall probably meet at <placeName>Portſ­
<lb/>mouth</placeName>?</said></p>
            <p><said>Probably,</said> anſwered <persName>Warwick</persName>; 
<said>for
<lb/>the two companies are to embark at the
<lb/>ſame time; and I only truſt to ſome pri­
<lb/>vate intereſt, which I have prevailed upon
<lb/>my uncle to make for me, to procure leave
<lb/>to embark in whatever veſſel is moſt con­

<lb/>venient.—The captain of one of the frigates
<lb/>is my particular friend, and I ſhall proba­
<lb/>bly get a birth with him inſtead of going
<lb/>in a tranſport.</said> <persName>Orlando</persName>, to whom the
<lb/>whole ſcheme appeared eaſily practicable,
<lb/>now again felt all the diſpoſition to join in
<lb/>it which he had before combated: but
<lb/>again his reaſon came to his aid, and he
<lb/>ſaw <persName>Warwick</persName> depart without betraying any
<lb/>ſymptoms of that ſtruggle which ſtill tore
<lb/>his heart.</p>
            <p>Once more, however, he ſubdued it;
<lb/>and recalled his reſolution to go through
<lb/>the trying ſcene which was to await him on
<lb/>his return to the houſe, where he was early
<lb/>in the evening to bid adieu to all his
<lb/>family, in order to ſup with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>
<lb/>as ſhe had deſired; and then! the laſt
<lb/>cruel parting with <persName>Monimia</persName>, more dreadful
<lb/>than any of his former ſufferings, was to
<lb/>embitter his laſt moments at <name>Rayland-Hall</name>.</p>
            <p>The laſt adieu between a father ſo affec­
<lb/>tionate and unhappy and a ſon ſo beloved,
<lb/>need not be deſcribed—it would indeed be
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">difficult</mw>

<pb n="239"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L12r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">239</mw>
<lb/>difficult to do it juſtice. As his mother and
<lb/>his ſiſters hung weeping about him, he could
<lb/>not help addreſſing ſome words to <persName>Iſabella</persName>,
<lb/>however unfavourable the time, which ſhe
<lb/>ſeemed perfectly to underſtand—though ſhe
<lb/>ſhrunk from them, and had carefully
<lb/>avoided giving him any opportunity of 
<lb/>ſpeaking to her alone. At length <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>tore himſelf away; and not daring to look
<lb/>behind him, yet hardly feeling the ground
<lb/>beneath him, he hurried to the Hall.</p>
            <p><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> received him with as
<lb/>much calmneſs as if he only came on a 
<lb/>uſual viſit. Of the violent emotions which
<lb/>agitated him ſhe had no idea. Time and
<lb/>uninterrupted proſperity had ſo blunted the
<lb/>little ſenſibility nature had given her, that
<lb/>ſhe was utterly incapable of participating or
<lb/>comprehending the acute feelings of her
<lb/>young favourite: yet in her way ſhe was
<lb/>extremely kind to him; and, after giving
<lb/>him another courſe of excellent advice,
<lb/>which laſted near two hours, ſhe told him,
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">that</mw>

<pb n="240"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L12v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">240</mw>
<lb/>that as his firſt equipment might have taken
<lb/>a good part of her former preſent, ſhe had
<lb/>another note of fifty pounds at his ſervice.
<lb/>This preſent was extremely acceptable to
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, who had not above ſixty left of
<lb/>her preceding bounty. <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, de­
<lb/>taining <persName>Orlando</persName> an hour longer than he ex­
<lb/>pected, at length diſmiſſed him with her
<lb/>bleſſing; and <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhed tears of grati­
<lb/>tude on her hand, which he kiſſed, and,
<lb/>without being able to ſpeak, left her.</p>
            <p>He then took leave of the ſervants;
<lb/>but gave to <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, with whom he
<lb/>deſired to ſpeak in her own room, more
<lb/>time than to the reſt; and deſirous of do­
<lb/>ing what he could to ſoften the ſituation
<lb/>of his <persName>Monimia</persName>, he determined to ſpeak to
<lb/>her aunt on her behalf.</p>
            <p><said>You know, Madam,</said> ſaid he, <said>that
<lb/>on my laſt departure you ſpoke to me of
<lb/>your niece: let me now ſpeak to you of
<lb/>her. My abſence may ſatisfy you as to 
<lb/>thoſe ſuſpicions, that I know not why you

<lb/>entertained of me—but let me entreat you
<lb/>to be kind to my lovely young friend, for
<lb/>whom I ſcruple not to avow to you a very
<lb/>great regard.</said></p>
            <p><said>What!</said> cried <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>, 
<said>has ſhe
<lb/>ever then been ſuch an ungrateful girl as
<lb/>to ſay I was unkind to her?</said></p>
            <p><said>Never,</said> ſaid <persName>Orlando</persName>:—
<said>in the con­
<lb/>verſations we have accidentally had, your
<lb/>niece has always ſpoken of you with gra­
<lb/>titude and reſpect; but, after what you
<lb/>once ſaid to me about her, I ſhould be
<lb/>remiſs were I to quit the houſe without
<lb/>trying to obviate any little lurking preju­
<lb/>dice which may at ſome future time be re­
<lb/>membered to her diſadvantage: allow me
<lb/>therefore to intercede with you, not only to
<lb/>forget any of theſe circumſtances which
<lb/>may prejudice your mind againſt her, but
<lb/>to increaſe that tenderneſs for her, which
<lb/>does ſo much honour to your heart.</said></p>
            <p><said>Thank you, Sir,</said> ſaid <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>,

<lb/>nor any body's, to do my duty to the girl,
<lb/>ſince ſhe is left upon my hands.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> never felt ſo great an inclination
<lb/>as at that moment, to take <persName>Monimia</persName> off
<lb/>her hands; and, as he found little was to
<lb/>be hoped for from his ſolicitations in her
<lb/>favour, he took leave of <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>,
<lb/>and endeavoured, when alone, to collect
<lb/>all his reſolution for this final adieu with
<lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>; to drive from his recollection
<lb/>the offer of <persName>Warwick</persName>, which ſtill recurred
<lb/>to tantalize and torment him; to con­
<lb/>ceal from her that it ever had been made,
<lb/>and to fortify her mind for their long ſepa­
<lb/>ration while he felt his own ſinking under it.</p>
            <p>Among other things it occurred to him,
<lb/>that if death or caprice deprived <persName>Monimia</persName>
<lb/>of the cold and reluctant protection her
<lb/>aunt now afforded her, ſhe might be not
<lb/>only deſolate but pennyleſs. He deter­
<lb/>mined, therefore, to leave with her one of
<lb/>the banker's notes he had juſt received,
<lb/>of five-and-twenty pounds, and to paſs

<lb/>theſe laſt moments in arming her againſt
<lb/>every poſſible contingency which might
<lb/>happen during his abſence, and, as far as
<lb/>he could, inſtructing her how to act if they
<lb/>occurred.</p>
            <p><persName>Monimia</persName>, with ſwollen eyes, from
<lb/>which the tears ſlowly fell notwithſtanding
<lb/>her endeavours to reſtrain them, liſtened
<lb/>in ſilence, as with a faltering tone and in
<lb/>disjointed ſentences he went through this
<lb/>mournful taſk. She promiſed in a voice
<lb/>hardly articulate to attend to all he deſired,
<lb/>and to keep a journal of her life; <said>though
<lb/>what will it be,</said> ſaid ſhe, <said>but a journal
<lb/>of ſufferings and of ſorrow?</said></p>
            <p><said>But when that ſorrow, thoſe ſufferings
<lb/>are over, my <persName>Monimia</persName>,</said> cried <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>trying to ſpeak cheerfully, <said>with what
<lb/>tranſport ſhall we look back on this journal,
<lb/>and compare our paſt anxieties with our

            <p>She could only anſwer by a deep drawn
<lb/>ſigh; while <persName>Orlando</persName>, cruel as the ſcene
<lb/>was, could not determine to put an end
<lb/>to it. Day already dawned; and as he did
<lb/>not mean to go to bed, but had ordered
<lb/>the under-keeper to attend him with the
<lb/>horſes as ſoon as it was light, he knew that
<lb/>he ſhould ſoon be called by <persName>Jacob</persName>: yet
<lb/>could he not determine to lead <persName>Monimia</persName> 
<lb/>back to her turret till he heard the man at

<lb/>and thought how much he probably had

            <p><persName>Jacob</persName>, who had but little notion of all

<lb/>of dragoons with their horſes. The wind,
<lb/>though violent, blew down the channel;
<lb/>and at nightfall, all previous orders being
<lb/>given, they obeyed the ſignal for getting
<lb/>to ſea. It was not till they were many
<lb/>miles at ſea that <persName>Orlando</persName> had time to con­
<lb/>ſider his ſituation: then, the tumult hav­
<lb/>ing a little ſubſided, he ſaw himſelf in a

<lb/>equal the inconvenience to which his ſol­
<lb/>diers were ſubjected, but that which the
<lb/>miſerable negroes endure in their paſſage
<lb/>to ſlavery<anchor xml:id="a05" corresp="#n05" rend="pre(*)"/>. Indifferent to this, ſo far as
<lb/>it merely related to himſelf, he could not
<lb/>ſee the ſufferings to which the men were 
<lb/>likely to be expoſed without concern.
<lb/>All of them were young and new to the
<lb/>ſervice; and the captain was too attentive
<lb/>to his own delicacy to have time to give
<lb/>the poor fellows all the alleviation their

<lb/>condition allowed them; and, on the 
<lb/>ſecond day of their voyage, he found his
<lb/>own ſituation ſo unpleaſant, that he went in
<lb/>a boat on board one of the frigates, the com­
<lb/>mander of which was diſtantly related to
<lb/>him, and obtained of him for the reſt of the
<lb/>voyage a birth more ſuitable to a man of
<lb/>faſhion than a crowded tranſport could af­
<lb/>ford him.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, the lieutenant (who was half
<lb/>broken-hearted), and a cornet of horſe were
<lb/>left in charge of the men; and it was per­
<lb/>haps fortunate for the former, that he was
<lb/>ſo inceſſantly called upon to attend to his
<lb/>duty that he had hardly a moment to com­
<lb/>mand but for repoſe, and, occupied about
<lb/>others, could think but little of himſelf.</p>
            <p>They had now been ſo long at ſea, that
<lb/>the freſh water ſailors had conquered the
<lb/>firſt uneaſy ſenſations given by that element,
<lb/>except the young cornet, who was the only

<lb/>that even his requeſt to enter the army,

<lb/>could neither be evaded nor denied. The
<lb/>ſmart uniform of a light horſeman appeared
<lb/>to him extremely deſirable; and the poſ­
<lb/>ſibility of danger in ſuch a ſervice never
<lb/>occurred to him, nor would he liſten to it
<lb/>when it was repreſented by others. He had
<lb/>hardly put on this ſeducing attire, and pro­
<lb/>vided himſelf with a very beautiful horſe,
<lb/>before he was ordered abroad; and now
<lb/>ſick and deſponding, this unhappy child of 
<lb/>fooliſh affluence wanted a nurſe much more
<lb/>than a broad ſword—No puling girl juſt
<lb/>out of the nurſery was ever more helpleſs;
<lb/>and <persName>Orlando</persName> at once deſpiſed and pitied
<lb/>him; but found that, having been friendly
<lb/>enough to offer him his aſſiſtance, his new
<lb/>acquaintance ſoon leaned entirely upon
<lb/>him; and that having been uſed to have

<lb/>Hitherto their voyage had been proſperous

<lb/>operating on the crowds of men and of
<lb/>horſes ſtowed in ſuch a veſſel, now began
<lb/>to be ſeverely felt. A fever of the malig­

<lb/>from the wickedneſs of governments, or

<lb/>as wars of every deſcription muſt neceſſa­

<lb/>in their perſonal valour, in their contempt
<lb/>of death; and he did not recollect that
<lb/>their being themſelves ſo indifferent to life
<lb/>was no reaſon why, to ſatisfy their own
<lb/>vanity, they ſhould deluge the world with
<lb/>human blood. There were, indeed, times
<lb/>when the modern directors of war appeared

<lb/>mire the integrity of the ſubordinate de­
<lb/>partments, to whom the care of providing
<lb/>for troops thus ſent out to ſupport the
<lb/>glory of their maſter was entruſted. The
<lb/>proviſions on board were univerſally bad;

<lb/>ended fatally. But it was all for <emph>glory</emph>. And
<lb/>that the miniſtry ſhould, in thus purchaſing

<lb/>contrived to ſend a meſſage to the captain
<lb/>of the frigate, one of the convoy, with
<lb/>whom <persName>Warwick</persName> had told him he was ac­
<lb/>quainted; but this officer, to the infinite
<lb/>diſappointment of <persName>Orlando</persName>, told him in
<lb/>anſwer to his letter, that it was true his
<lb/>friend <persName>Warwick</persName> had ſent ſome of his bag­
<lb/>gage on board, and a negro ſervant; but
<lb/>that, after waiting for him till the laſt mo­
<lb/>ment, it became abſolutely neceſſary for 
<lb/>him to ſail without him. This account
<lb/>only ſerved, therefore, to increaſe the un­
<lb/>eaſineſs of <persName>Orlando</persName>, who now feared that,
<lb/>inſtead of being able on his landing in
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName> to write inſtantly to his father
<lb/>with an account both of himſelf and his
<lb/>ſiſter, he ſhould only add to the diſquiet
<lb/>which he believed her flight muſt have oc­
<lb/>caſioned to her family: nor was he at all

<lb/>ſatisfied that <persName>Warwick's</persName> diſhonourable con­
<lb/>duct towards her was not the cauſe of their
<lb/>not being in the fleet, which he was now
<lb/>almoſt perſuaded they were not.</p>
            <p>If at any time he had obtained a ſhort
<lb/>interval of repoſe, theſe cruel images
<lb/>haunted him; but, as the voyage was pro­
<lb/>longed, and the diſcomforts of his con­
<lb/>dition became more ſevere, he found abun­
<lb/>dant reaſon to rejoice that he had reſiſted
<lb/>the alluring temptation offered to him by
<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName>, and had not expoſed his <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName> to difficulties and diſtreſſes, under
<lb/>which many around him had ſunk: and
<lb/>in this ſelf-congratulation he found the firſt
<lb/>reward of virtue; a ſenſation which ſoothed
<lb/>all his ſorrows, and enabled him to ſupport
<lb/>the accumulated evils which now preſſed
<lb/>upon him.</p>
            <p>The fleet was now within four days ſail
<lb/>of <placeName>New-York</placeName>; or at leaſt the ſailors,

<lb/>The ſick men revived a little with the in­

<lb/>they ſhould be driven againſt ſome of the

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, to whom as a novice in mari­
<lb/>time adventures the danger ſeemed even 
<lb/>greater than it was, imagined that death was
<lb/>inevitable, becauſe it had never appeared
<lb/>to him ſo near before. He thought, how­
<lb/>ever, not ſo much of the event, as of the 
<lb/>effect the intelligence of it would have on
<lb/>thoſe infinitely dearer to him than himſelf
<lb/>—He heard the agoniſing ſhrieks of his mo­

<lb/>unable to ſuppreſs their own grief while
<lb/>they attempted to adminiſter comfort to
<lb/>their parents, and above all the ſuffer­

<lb/>more acute becauſe ſhe dared not complain.
<lb/>Yet, when the veſſel ſtrained ſo much that

<lb/>with him. The deſpair of the lieutenant
<lb/>was ſolemn and ſilent:—he believed that
<lb/>the hour was come when he was to leave
<lb/>his family deſtitute in a world where, with
<lb/>all his exertions, his want of intereſt had
<lb/>not afforded him the means of ſupporting
<lb/>them by that perilous profeſſion to which
<lb/>he had dedicated his life. But he bore
<lb/>this certainty (for there ſeemed not the
<lb/>leaſt hope of eſcape) like a ſoldier and
<lb/>a man: he aſſiſted the ſailors; he encou­
<lb/>raged the ſoldiers; and endeavoured, with a
<lb/>calmneſs of mind which gave <persName>Orlando</persName> an
<lb/>exalted opinion of him, to inſpire others
<lb/>with that hope he did not himſelf feel.
<lb/>To <persName>Orlando</persName> only he declared his opinion
<lb/>that they muſt periſh; and he ſpoke in ap­
<lb/>probation of the fortitude with which ſo
<lb/>young a man, and one ſo unaccuſtomed to
<lb/>look on danger and death, bore this intelli­
<lb/>gence: but with the little cornet he could

<lb/>diſtract their attention by his complaints
<lb/>and clamours.</p>
            <p>Morning at length appeared, but the
<lb/>wind rather increaſed than abated; and the
<lb/>light of day ſerved only to ſhew the hor­
<lb/>rors of their ſituation, and of ſome of their
<lb/>companions in diſtreſs, who were ſtill in
<lb/>ſight, for the men of war were no longer 
<lb/>viſible; and of the three tranſports who
<lb/>were near them, one was diſmaſted, and
<lb/>another without her rudder was driven
<lb/>about a wreck upon the waves, under bare
<lb/>poles. From this veſſel, which the firſt
<lb/>dawn of day diſcovered cloſe to them, they
<lb/>heard repeated ſignals of diſtreſs. When­
<lb/>ever the mountainous waves afforded them
<lb/>a view of her, they ſaw the people, among
<lb/>whom were two or three women, appear­
<lb/>ing on her deck, apparently in all the ago­

<lb/>tude he watched it, till, in the confuſion of
<lb/>his thoughts, he fancied he really diſcerned
<lb/>her—All care for his own ſafety was then
<lb/>at an end; and he entreated the com­
<lb/>mander of the ſhip he was in to allow him
<lb/>to attempt in a boat to go on board, in the
<lb/>hopes of adminiſtering ſome help; but this

<lb/>it, without being of the leaſt uſe to thoſe

<lb/>was among the women, whoſe terrors he
<lb/>ſaw diſtinctly on the deck of the other
<lb/>veſſel, he now hardly poſſeſſed his ſenſes,
<lb/>and was on the point of plunging into the
<lb/>waves, tremendous as they were—when, as

<lb/>he ſaw it ſink, and the ſea bury all it con­

<lb/>an exclamation of horror, when ſome of
<lb/>the unhappy people appeared ſo near the
<lb/>ſhip, that the ſailors, though ſo likely to

<lb/>them; but two only, ſtout men who ſwam

            <p>The force of the wind was now ſome­
<lb/>what leſſened, and the men were inſpired
<lb/>by ſome degree of hope to greater exer­
<lb/>tions. About ten o'clock the ſtorm was 
<lb/>ſo much abated that the maſter was able to
<lb/>take an obſervation; and he found himſelf
<lb/>many leagues out of his courſe. No ſhip
<lb/>remained in ſight but one tranſport at a
<lb/>great diſtance, and the veſſel yet drove too
<lb/>much to allow them to attempt altering her
<lb/>courſe. Their immediate danger, how­
<lb/>ever, gradually diminiſhed; and every man
<lb/>on board, who was able to work, laboured,
<lb/>in deſpite of the fatigue they had under­
<lb/>gone, to repair their rigging, and remedy
<lb/>the damages the hull had ſuſtained. The

<lb/>ſick, who had for many hours been neglected,
<lb/>were now viſited; and one ſoldier was found
<lb/>dead. As to the horſes that remained,
<lb/>they had all been thrown overboard during
<lb/>the moſt imminent peril, as their weight
<lb/>occaſioned the ſhip to labour ſo much
<lb/>more than ſhe would do without them.
<lb/>The dead ſoldier was committed to the
<lb/>waves; and as <persName>Orlando</persName>, with glazed eyes,
<lb/>ſaw him depoſited in his watery grave, and
<lb/>recollected all the horrors of the preceding
<lb/>night, he again involuntarily enquired of
<lb/>himſelf, whether ſuch things were to be ac­
<lb/>counted the diſpenſations of Heaven—or,
<lb/>if they were the works of man, why they
<lb/>were permitted? The terrible idea that
<lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> had periſhed in that ſhip he ſaw
<lb/>ſink ſtill haunted him, and redoubled by
<lb/>imaginary ſorrow all that he ſaw or ſuffered.
<lb/>The poor fellows who had been taken up
<lb/>were ſo terribly bruiſed, and had ſwallowed
<lb/>ſo much water, that they were not yet ſen­
<lb/>ſible. As ſoon as they were, however, <persName>Or­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">271</mw>
<lb/>females whom he had, through the obſcurity
<lb/>of the dark and daſhing waves, diſcovered
<lb/>on the deck; and he learned, to increaſe
<lb/>his miſery, that one of them was a young
<lb/>lady, whoſe huſband was an officer of foot,
<lb/>and who was himſelf either in the fleet, or
<lb/>coming with the next convoy. The ſailor
<lb/>who gave him this information knew not
<lb/>which, nor did he know the lady's name,
<lb/>or to what regiment her huſband belonged.
<lb/>The other women, he ſaid, were, one of
<lb/>them the lady's ſervant, and the other the
<lb/>wife of a ſergeant in <persName>Orlando's</persName> regiment;
<lb/>which ſeemed to add to the probability
<lb/>that the young perſon who had periſhed
<lb/>was <persName>Iſabella</persName>. There hardly needed this

<lb/>which, in deſpite of all his ſteady courage,

<lb/>dency which he found it extremely difficult

<lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> ſome years.—He now hoped to
<lb/>have heard ſome account of his ſiſter and
<lb/>his friend that might have quieted his ex­
<lb/>treme uneaſineſs: but the ſight of <persName>Perſeus</persName> 
<lb/>only ſerved to increaſe it; for he learned
<lb/>from him that <persName>Captain Warwick</persName> arrived at
<lb/><placeName>Portſmouth</placeName> the evening the firſt tranſports
<lb/>ſailed, and that, by his intereſt with the
<lb/>captain of the frigate in which the negro
<lb/>embarked, and ſome perſons ſtill higher in
<lb/>power, that ſhip was delayed for ſome
<lb/>days, at the end of which <persName>Warwick</persName> pro­
<lb/>miſed to appear; but as he did not, nor
<lb/>even at the end of ſome hours longer than
<lb/>the time he required, the captain would
<lb/>have incurred too great a riſk by waiting
<lb/>longer; and therefore got under weigh
<lb/>with ſo ſtrong and favourable a wind, that
<lb/>they overtook the reſt of the fleet two days
<lb/>before they made the <placeName>Pike of Teneriffe</placeName>.
<lb/>This circumſtance, however, <persName>Perſeus</persName> ſaid,
<lb/>was the only one that gave him hope; for
<lb/>he knew his maſter, thus miſſing his paſ­

<lb/>which would probably not only take up
<lb/>ſome days, but hardly ſail as they did; and
<lb/>therefore there was reaſon to hope that he
<lb/>might have eſcaped the ſtorm in which they
<lb/>ſuffered, and it was improbable that the
<lb/>lady whom <persName>Orlando</persName> had ſeen periſh, and
<lb/>afterwards heard was the wife of an officer
<lb/>of foot, was his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>On being queſtioned farther, the negro,
<lb/>who was very intelligent, ſaid, that <persName>Captain
<lb/>Warwick</persName> had ordered him, with a great
<lb/>part of his baggage, on board; and that he
<lb/>knew his maſter expected a lady to go with
<lb/>him—but he knew not whom. The bag­
<lb/>gage was landed, and put into <persName>Orlando's</persName>
<lb/>lodging, where <persName>Perſeus</persName> deſired leave to wait
<lb/>upon him; and where the attention of this
<lb/>faithful fellow, and the hopes he gave him
<lb/>that <persName>Iſabella</persName> and her huſband were ſafe,
<lb/>contributed greatly to his recovery.</p>
            <p>A fortnight had now elapſed ſince his

<lb/>ſad ſcene at home, where he feared <persName>Iſa­

<lb/>ſorrow, cruelly tormented him; and the
<lb/>image of <persName>Monimia</persName> in continual tears and
<lb/>hopeleſs ſolitude, purſued him inceſſantly.
<lb/>A thouſand times during the paroxyſms of
<lb/>his fever he had inſiſted upon having pen
<lb/>and ink to write to her and to his family;
<lb/>and he began many letters to his father,
<lb/>recommending <persName>Monimia</persName> to his protection,
<lb/>and apologiſing for his conduct in regard
<lb/>to his ſiſter; but the Lieutenant, <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Fleming</persName>, had never ſent any of theſe inco­
<lb/>herent letters.—<persName>Orlando</persName> had now ſtrength
<lb/>of body and of mind enough to look them
<lb/>over; but, circumſtanced as he was about
<lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName>, he now hardly knew better than
<lb/>he did then, what to ſay that ſhould not
<lb/>aggravate all the pain he lamented: ſome­
<lb/>thing, however, it was neceſſary to write,
<lb/>as ſhips were now daily returning to <placeName>Eng­

<lb/>friends, than the ignorance he muſt avow as
<lb/>to the fate of his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>Another idea however ſtruck him, that
<lb/>ſome diſcovery, or even her own fears, as
<lb/>the moment arrived when ſhe was to leave
<lb/>her father's houſe, might have prevented
<lb/>the departure of <persName>Iſabella</persName> from home; and
<lb/>that even her intention of doing ſo might
<lb/>be unknown.—This made him heſitate
<lb/>whether to name her at all; and at length
<lb/>he determined he would not, ſince it would
<lb/>be only giving to his father an exchange,
<lb/>but not an alleviation of uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>He wrote then theſe unſatisfactory letters
<lb/>to his family; and afterwards one to <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName>.—He gave in all of them the beſt 
<lb/>account he could of himſelf, deſcribed his
<lb/>voyage as tedious and ſtormy; and ſaid,
<lb/>ſlightly, that he had been ill on his firſt 
<lb/>landing; but was now recovered, and
<lb/>ſhould ſoon proceed to join the body of his

<lb/>to muſter all that remained of the two com­

<lb/>which was now on its march from <placeName>Canada</placeName>
<lb/>to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, in order to form a junction, or

<lb/>began to perceive all the horrors and de­

<lb/>dwellings, conſtructed huts on their lands,

<lb/>places moſt eagerly contended for, had

<lb/>almoſt loſt the ſemblance of humanity.
<lb/>The party had now marched about ſeventy
<lb/>miles; and as they carried their proviſions
<lb/>with them, which it was not poſſible to do
<lb/>in a great quantity, it became neceſſary
<lb/>for them to encamp, and ſend out foraging
<lb/>parties to obtain a ſupply before it was
<lb/>actually wanted. It was on the edge of
<lb/>one of thoſe moraſſes which are called by
<lb/>the natives ſavannahs, encircled on all
<lb/>ſides by woods, that they formed this ſmall
<lb/>camp; where the Colonel, to whom the
<lb/>conduct of this expedition was entruſted,
<lb/>fortified it as well as ſuch a ſituation would
<lb/>admit; but <persName>Lieutenant Fleming</persName>, whoſe
<lb/>attachment to <persName>Orlando</persName> a long intercourſe
<lb/>of mutual kindneſs had now greatly
<lb/>ſtrengthened, pointed out to him, in confi­
<lb/>dence, the defects of the ſtation thus choſen;
<lb/>and declared that if any body of American
<lb/>troops, or rebels as they were then called,
<lb/>was in the country, they muſt be ſurround­

<lb/>ed, and either compelled to ſurrender or
<lb/>fight their way through. It happened,
<lb/>however, that for many days they remained
<lb/>unmoleſted—ſome recruit of proviſions was
<lb/>obtained, and the plan of their future
<lb/>march ſettled. The parties who went out
<lb/>ſaw no enemies to oppoſe them; and <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> had now an opportunity of obſerving
<lb/>this wonderful country, ſo extremely un­
<lb/>like <placeName>England</placeName>, that it appeared to him to be
<lb/>indeed a new world.</p>
            <p>Every object ſeemed formed upon a 
<lb/>larger ſcale. The rivers, more frequent
<lb/>than in <placeName>England</placeName>, were broader than the
<lb/>moſt boaſted of ours, even on their ap­
<lb/>proach to the ſea; and the woods, larger
<lb/>than the oldeſt European foreſts, even
<lb/>thoſe that Kings have reſerved for their
<lb/>pleaſure in <placeName>France</placeName> or <placeName>England</placeName>, conſiſted
<lb/>often of trees of ſuch magnitude and beauty
<lb/>as muſt be ſeen before a perfect idea can be
<lb/>formed of them. What <persName>Orlando</persName> had often
<lb/>ſeen cheriſhed in Engliſh gardens as beauti­
<lb/>ful ſhrubs, here roſe into plants of ſuch

<lb/>majeſtic ſize and foliage as made the Britiſh
<lb/>oak poor in compariſon; and under them
<lb/>innumerable ſhrubs, of many of which he
<lb/>knew not the names, grew in profuſion.
<lb/>Theſe woods, however, had in many places
<lb/>ſuffered like the reſt of the country; and
<lb/>in ſome had been ſet on fire—in others the
<lb/>trees had been felled, as means of temporary
<lb/>defence.—And <persName>Orlando</persName>, whoſe early and
<lb/>ingenuous philanthropy had of late been
<lb/>often injured by a painful ſenſation of diſ­
<lb/>guſt, could not help remarking with a 
<lb/>ſigh, that man ſeemed not only a creature
<lb/>born to conſume the fruits of the earth
<lb/>but to wound and deform the boſom of 
<lb/>that earth! and he found himſelf almoſt
<lb/>involuntarily aſſenting to ſome of the moſt
<lb/>gloomy aphoriſms of <persName>Rouſſeau</persName>.</p>
            <p>But he was yet a novice; and had only
<lb/>of late underſtood, as well as a partial
<lb/>repreſentation of the cauſe by his otherwiſe
<lb/>candid friend <persName>Fleming</persName> would let him under­
<lb/>ſtand, the origin of the quarrel in which he
<lb/>had drawn his ſword.</p>

            <p>The ſcenes however he had already 
<lb/>been witneſs to, were, <emph>he</emph> thought, not to be
<lb/>juſtified by <emph>any</emph> cauſe: but his fellow ſol­
<lb/>diers ſeemed to ſee them in a very different
<lb/>light; and to conſider the <name>Engliſh Ameri­
<lb/>cans</name> as men of an inferior ſpecies, whoſe
<lb/>reſiſtance to the meaſures, whatever thoſe
<lb/>might be, of the mother country, de­
<lb/>ſerved every puniſhment that the moſt

<lb/>and even the brave and generally humane
<lb/><persName>Fleming</persName> endeavoured to convert <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>whoſe ſcruples as to the juſtice of the war
<lb/>became greater the more he heard of its
<lb/>origin.—He aſſured him that a ſoldier
<lb/>never thought of examining into ſuch
<lb/>matters—<said>It is,</said> 
ſaid he, <said>our buſineſs
<lb/>to fight; never to aſk for what—for if
<lb/>every man, or even every officer in the
<lb/>ſervice were to ſet about thinking, it is ten
<lb/>to one if any two of them agreed as to the 
<lb/>merits of the cauſe. A man who takes the
<lb/>King's money is to do as he is bid, and
<lb/>never debate the matter. For my part, I
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">have</mw>

<pb n="284"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">284</mw>
<lb/>have heard while I was in <placeName>England</placeName> a great
<lb/>deal of clamour upon the ſubject; and it
<lb/>has been called a war upon the people, and
<lb/>therefore an unpopular war.—I am no poli­
<lb/>tician, nor do I deſire to enter into a diſ­
<lb/>cuſſion about taxation and repreſentation,
<lb/>which theſe fellows have made the ground
<lb/>for their reſiſtance. There is no end of
<lb/>the nonſenſe that may be talked in favour
<lb/>of their rebellion, nor the pleas of the 
<lb/>miniſterial party. For myſelf, as I was
<lb/>brought up in the army, I have always cut
<lb/>the matter very ſhort—the ſword is my ar­
<lb/>gument; and I have ſold that to my King,
<lb/>and therefore muſt uſe it in his ſervice,
<lb/>whatever and wherever it may be pointed

            <p>This way of ſettling the matter was,
<lb/>however, ſo far from being convincing to
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, that it gave him new cauſe for
<lb/>reflection. He had always been told, that
<lb/>the will of the people was the great reſort in
<lb/>the <orgName>Britiſh Government</orgName>; and that no pub­
<lb/>lic meaſure of magnitude and importance

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">285</mw>
<lb/>could be decided upon, but by the agree­
<lb/>ment of the <name>Three Eſtates</name>. Yet the preſent
<lb/>war, carried on againſt a part of their own
<lb/>body, and in direct contradiction of the 
<lb/>rights univerſally claimed, was not only
<lb/>purſued at a ruinous expence, but in abſo­
<lb/>lute contradiction to the wiſhes of the people
<lb/>who were taxed to support it. <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>did not comprehend how this could be—
<lb/>he could not, however, though ſo often aſſur­
<lb/>ed that it was no part of his buſineſs, help
<lb/>thinking about it; and an American pri­
<lb/>ſoner, who was brought to their little camp 
<lb/>by a ſcouting party juſt before it broke up,
<lb/>aſſiſted very much to clear up his ideas on 
<lb/>this ſubject. He was a man in middling
<lb/>life, and had kept a ſtore at <placeName>New York</placeName>;
<lb/>but, having taken part with his own country­
<lb/>men, had been ſent by them to <orgName>Congreſs</orgName>,
<lb/>where, being a man of ſtrong plain under­
<lb/>ſtanding, he had joined heartily in all the
<lb/>meaſures of reſiſtance, and afterwards gone
<lb/>into the field for the ſame purpoſe: but
<lb/>hearing that his wife, an Engliſh woman,

<lb/>whom he paſſionately loved, and his only
<lb/>ſon, a boy of ſeven years old, were arrived
<lb/>at <placeName>New York</placeName> from <placeName>England</placeName>, whither they
<lb/>had gone two years before, he had obtained
<lb/>leave to quit his command for a ſhort time,
<lb/>and had ſet out alone, and in diſguiſe, in
<lb/>the intention of reaching the neighbour­
<lb/>hood of <placeName>New York</placeName>; where, at the houſe of
<lb/>one of his temporiſing friends, he had ap­
<lb/>pointed his wife and child to meet him—
<lb/>in the hope of conveying them himſelf,
<lb/>through a country abounding in perils, to a 
<lb/>place of preſent ſafety.</p>
            <p>But when he was within an hundred
<lb/>miles of the place he wiſhed to reach (a
<lb/>diſtance that in <placeName>America</placeName> is reckoned a 
<lb/>trifle), he had been met by a party of <name>In­
<lb/>dians</name>, whom the Britiſh commanders had
<lb/>lately let looſe upon the <name>Americans</name>; and
<lb/>having narrowly eſcaped being ſcalped, by
<lb/>promiſes, and ſome deceptions very allow­
<lb/>able in ſuch a ſituation, he was brought by

<lb/>received intelligence. As this unfortunate
<lb/><name>American</name> immediately diſcloſed to the
<lb/>commanding officer who he really was, and
<lb/>for what purpoſe going to <placeName>New York</placeName>, he
<lb/>was deemed of conſequence enough to be
<lb/>ſent thither a priſoner; and, till this could
<lb/>be done, he was alternately guarded by 
<lb/>the Britiſh officers:—a circumſtance that
<lb/>gave <persName>Orlando</persName> an opportunity he never be­
<lb/>fore had, of hearing the American party 
<lb/>tell their own ſtory, which ſerved only to
<lb/>excite his pity for them, and a pity not un­

<lb/>increaſed as he conſidered the infatuation
<lb/>of the <orgName>Britiſh Cabinet</orgName>, or rather the eaſy
<lb/>acquieſcence of the <name>Britiſh People</name>.</p>
            <p>If his concern was called forth by wit­
<lb/>neſſing the anguiſh of mind endured by
<lb/>his new acquaintance when he thought of
<lb/>his wife and child—anguiſh with which

<lb/>manners; and by hearing that he had, at

            <p>The ſecret ſympathy between generous

<lb/>when they left their camp, and continued

<lb/>eſcort as they could ſpare), the <persName>Wolf-

<lb/>had the ſatisfaction of ſhewing, by his un­

<lb/>the gratitude he felt for his former friend­
<lb/>ſhip. But the care neceſſary to the wound­
<lb/>ed, and the difficulties that their own people,
<lb/>in order to prevent their being followed by
<lb/>the enemy, had every where thrown in the
<lb/>way of their march, made it ſo tedious and
<lb/>ſo dangerous, that they often deſpaired of

<lb/>diſappointed that a ſtronger reinforcement
<lb/>was not ſent them from <placeName>New York</placeName>, and a
<lb/>ſupply of proviſions, of which they began to
<lb/>apprehend the want. At the ſame time
<lb/>the march of ſuch a ſmall body of men,

<lb/>was a matter of wonder; and in the detail
<lb/>of their expedition given by the command­

<lb/>that he was deſired to make him a compli­

<lb/>which laſted, however, only a few moments

<lb/>between this action and the removal of the
<lb/>Britiſh camp by night, from a ſituation no
<lb/>longer tenable, was ſhort, but dreadful.
<lb/>Fatigue and famine, great as thoſe evils
<lb/>were, ſeemed leſs terrible to the minds of
<lb/>the <name>Engliſh</name>, than the certainty that they
<lb/>muſt very ſoon ſurrender to an enemy
<lb/>whom they at once abhorred and con­
<lb/>temned. The officers ſtill endeavoured to 
<lb/>encourage their men, and keep up the ſpi­
<lb/>rits of each other—they recollected other
<lb/>occaſions in which armies, in a condition
<lb/>equally deſperate, had broken through their
<lb/>enemies, and conquered thoſe who hoped 
<lb/>to have deſtroyed them: but the com­
<lb/>mander himſelf knew the fallacy of theſe
<lb/>hopes, and ſaw that, unleſs ſuccours arrived
<lb/>in a very few days, the ſurrender of his
<lb/>army was inevitable.</p>
            <p>They had now, however, a meſſenger
<lb/>from <placeName>New York</placeName>, with information that
<lb/>three thouſand men were advancing to
<lb/>their aſſiſtance up <placeName>Hudſon's River</placeName>; but this

<lb/>after it was undertaken, ſo managed, that
<lb/>there appeared not the leaſt probability of 
<lb/>their arriving in time to ſave from the ne­

<lb/>The ſame meſſenger, however, who had
<lb/>with infinite difficulty made his way to
<lb/>the Engliſh camp from <placeName>New York</placeName>, brought
<lb/>a few letters to the Britiſh officers—and

<lb/>heart, and with hands ſo tremulous that he
<lb/>could hardly break the ſeal, opened a pac­
<lb/>ket from his ſiſter <persName>Selina</persName>. It contained a

<lb/>herſelf, whoſe letter <persName>Selina</persName> had incloſed:</p>

<lb/>It would be ſome comfort to me, if what

<lb/>much of your brother, who is known to be

<lb/>it is ſaid he ſupports by gaming. Your poor
<lb/>mother went up with <persName>Selina</persName> about ten days

<lb/>ing him to return to his family. <persName>Selina</persName>
<lb/>deſcribed the meeting to me, and half

<lb/>with which ſhe has endeavoured to conſole

<lb/>vered the ſhock and mortification of <persName>Iſa­
<lb/>bella's</persName> defection. He left <placeName>Weſt Wolver­
<lb/>ton</placeName> as ſoon afterwards as the gout allowed
<lb/>him to move; and, it is ſaid, has diſin­
<lb/>herited <persName>Captain Warwick</persName>, and given his
<lb/>whole fortune to his brother's ſon, whoſe
<lb/>title I cannot now recollect—However, he
<lb/>does not ſeem to reſent <persName>Iſabella's</persName> deſertion of
<lb/>him towards the reſt of your family; for I
<lb/>underſtand that it was by his means your
<lb/>mother procured an interview with your
<lb/>brother; and that he was very obliging to
<lb/>her and <persName>Selina</persName> while they were in <placeName>London</placeName>.
<lb/>I have, though with a heavy heart, Heaven

                  <p>And now, <persName>Orlando</persName>, muſt I talk to you

<lb/>but what will make you unhappy. <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Rayland</persName> ſeems to regret your abſence very
<lb/>much; ſhe ſpeaks of you every day, and
<lb/>appears to me to be ſorry ſhe ever ſuffered
<lb/>you to depart. Judge, dear <persName>Orlando</persName>!
<lb/>whether I do not execute the little offices
<lb/>about her, which now ſhe will ſuffer no
<lb/>other perſon to do, with redoubled plea­
<lb/>ſure, when I hear her thus ſpeaking of you
<lb/>like a tender mother! I wonder how I
<lb/>ever diſliked her, and thought her ſevere.
<lb/>Ah! I wiſh <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName> had half as
<lb/>much kindneſs; yet has her Lady had
<lb/>much to diſturb her lately, and my aunt

<lb/>Rayland</persName> to replace him with a <persName>Mr. Roker</persName>,
<lb/>who ſhe tells me is a relation of hers, and
<lb/>a relation of mine, which may be; but of

<lb/>however, got every thing into his hands
<lb/>through the influence of my aunt; and his

<lb/>put into the houſe at <placeName>North Park End</placeName>,
<lb/>where <persName>Mr. Harbourne</persName> uſed to be for a 
<lb/>month or two; which is fitting up quite in
<lb/>an elegant ſtyle, as to new papering, paint­
<lb/>ing, &amp;c. I hope when it is done he will be
<lb/>leſs at this houſe than he is now; for,
<lb/>at preſent, he paſſes every day here, and
<lb/>very often the night; though I never
<lb/>could obſerve that his hateful cringing
<lb/>manners pleaſed <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, who does
<lb/>not know, I believe, that he has taken poſ­
<lb/>ſeſſion of your room.—Oh! how different a
<lb/>poſſeſſor from what it ought to have! I meant,
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, to have ſaid as little of this diſa­
<lb/>greeable change as I could; but my
<lb/>unconquerable averſion to theſe two men
<lb/>has betrayed me into ſaying more about
<lb/>them than I intended: yet I find from
<lb/><persName>Selina</persName>, that your father is uneaſy at their

<lb/>man of the worſt character of any attorney
<lb/>in the country.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will impatiently exclaim,
<lb/>Why does <persName>Monimia</persName> talk to me about
<lb/>theſe attorneys when ſhe began with ſaying
<lb/>ſhe would mention herſelf? It is, <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>becauſe they have had more influence al­
<lb/>ready in injuring my peace than you would
<lb/>ſuppoſe likely. This <persName>Roker</persName> (the nephew),
<lb/>were he not young enough almoſt to be 
<lb/>her grandſon, I ſhould really fancy was a
<lb/>lover of my <persName>aunt Lennard's</persName>. He is a great
<lb/>raw-boned fright of a man, I think, with
<lb/>two eyes that look I know not how, but
<lb/>particularly horrible to me—a wide mouth,
<lb/>full of great teeth, that are only the more
<lb/>hideous for being white, becauſe his face is
<lb/>ſo red that, when he grins, the contraſt
<lb/>makes him ſeem ready to devour one; then
<lb/>he has a red beard, and a great buſhy head
<lb/>of carroty hair: but all this my aunt ſays
<lb/>is handſome; and that this giant-looking
<lb/>monſter, who is not, I think, above eight-
<lb/>and-twenty, is a fine and manly figure. The

<lb/>man returns, or rather earns, this her good
<lb/>opinion of him, by flattery ſo fulſome that
<lb/>really I bluſh for my aunt when I hear it;
<lb/>which, however, ſhe takes care I ſhall do as
<lb/>little as poſſible, for ſhe is almoſt always out
<lb/>of humour with me on ſome pretence or
<lb/>other when he comes into the room where
<lb/>I am, and generally contrives ſome excuſe
<lb/>to ſend me away; and before her the diſ­
<lb/>agreeable monſter affects not to notice
<lb/>me; but if ever I meet him by accident in
<lb/>the houſe, which I avoid as much as I can,
<lb/>he ſpeaks to me ſo impertinently that I
<lb/>have often been provoked to tears; indeed
<lb/>I am convinced he would be more inſolent
<lb/>if I did not threaten that I would acquaint
<lb/>my aunt.</p>
                  <p>I paſs almoſt every moment of the time
<lb/>that <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> does not want me, in

<lb/>and while my very ſoul ſickens to tell you

<lb/>yourſelf the cauſe of it, it is neceſſary that I
<lb/>adhere to my promiſe, <persName>Orlando</persName>, and con­

                  <p>You recollect, my dear friend, the pain

<lb/>curred (of which I cannot now think with­
<lb/>out trembling), in conſequence of that un­
<lb/>lucky meeting with <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>.—
<lb/>This perſon, you know, left the country
<lb/>ſoon after, and went into <placeName>Scotland</placeName> with
<lb/>your brother; and I remember your telling
<lb/>me afterwards, that he was gone abroad for

<lb/>being extremely well, which ſhe had not

<lb/>leaving me ſtrict orders not to quit her
<lb/>miſtreſs. After tea the evening was ſo warm,
<lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> felt herſelf ſo well, that
<lb/>ſhe had an inclination to get into the park
<lb/>chair; and for <persName>Pattenſon</persName> to lead the old
<lb/>pony in it round the park ſlowly, that ſhe
<lb/>might ſee the alterations and repairs which
<lb/>ſhe had been perſuaded to order for the
<lb/>accommodation of the nephew and deputy
<lb/>of her new ſteward at <placeName>North Park</placeName>; and
<lb/>after ſhe was ſeated by the footman ſafely
<lb/>in this low carriage, which you know ſhe
<lb/>has not been in for almoſt two years, ſhe
<lb/>ſaid ſhe found it very pleaſant, and was
<lb/>ſure ſhe could bear to go quite up to the
<lb/>lodge; but, leſt ſhe ſhould be faint, ſhe
<lb/>ordered me to walk by the ſide of the chair
<lb/>with her drops. <persName>Pattenſon</persName> did all he could
<lb/>to perſuade her that the diſtance would be
<lb/>too much for her; but ſhe ſpoke to him
<lb/>more ſharply than ever I heard her do
<lb/>before—ſaying, that ſhe was the beſt judge
<lb/>of that; and we ſet out, the carriage
<lb/>being drawn only a foot pace, ſo that I

<lb/>found no difficulty in keeping up with it.
<lb/>As we went along, we ſaw your horſe lying
<lb/>under the cheſnut trees in the long walk;
<lb/>for it was a very hot evening, and he had
<lb/>gone there for ſhade. <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> cal­
<lb/>led to me, and pointed him out to me—
<lb/><said>Poor creature!</said> ſaid ſhe, <said>he looks
<lb/>melancholy, as if he miſſed his maſter; and
<lb/>he is quite ſolitary too in the park.</said> Then
<lb/>ſpeaking to <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, ſhe aſked if he
<lb/>was well taken care of?—While I, with a 
<lb/>ſigh, <emph>could</emph> have anſwered her remark, by
<lb/>ſaying—Ah, Madam! there are other be­
<lb/>ings who miſs <persName>Orlando</persName> yet more than that
<lb/>beloved animal, and who are more ſolitary
<lb/>and undone than he is.—But I affected to
<lb/>be at eaſe; and hope my countenance did
<lb/>not betray how much my heart was other­
<lb/>wiſe.—Indeed there was the leſs danger of
<lb/>this, becauſe <persName>Pattenſon's</persName> anſwer, which was
<lb/>very ſurly, and ſignified that ſhe had better
<lb/>aſk about your horſe of <persName>Jacob</persName>, with whom it

<lb/>from me, and fixed it upon <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, towards
<lb/>whom ſhe expreſſed her diſpleaſure. Indeed
<lb/>he has ſeemed to me for ſome time to be
<lb/>loſing ground in her favour. At length we
<lb/>reached the north lodge; and as the work­
<lb/>men were putting up a new door, which you
<lb/>know is next the high road from <name>Carloraine
<lb/>Caſtle</name> to <placeName>Wolverton</placeName> and other villages,
<lb/>and putting on a new coat of ſtucco on
<lb/>that ſide, <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> ordered <persName>Patten­
<lb/>ſon</persName> to lead the chaiſe round thither, and
<lb/>ſtopped ſome moments there, while ſhe
<lb/>talked to the carpenter and plaſterer, who
<lb/>were juſt going from their work. She
<lb/>kindly ſaid to me—<said>If you are tired, <persName>Mary</persName>,
<lb/>ſit down at my feet and reſt yourſelf.</said>—I
<lb/>aſſured her I was not; but ſhe bade me get
<lb/>her a glaſs of water out of the houſe, and
<lb/>give her a few drops, leſt ſhe ſhould find
<lb/>the ride too much before ſhe got home.
<lb/>There was not a glaſs in the houſe; ſo I ran
<lb/>acroſs the way to <persName>James Carter's</persName> cottage,
<lb/>which is, you know, about fifty yards be­
<lb/>yond the lodge, on the oppoſite ſide. His

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">313</mw>
<lb/>wife went out with the water, and I followed
<lb/>her; when a gentleman, attended by two
<lb/>ſervants, rode up ſo very faſt, that his
<lb/>horſe almoſt trampled on me before I could
<lb/>croſs the road. He checked it, however,
<lb/>when he ſaw me, and exclaiming with a 
<lb/>great oath—<said>My lovely little wood-
<lb/>nymph! By all that's ſacred ſhe ſhall not

<lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> and her ſervants, who were
<lb/>concealed partly by the projection of the
<lb/>lodge on that ſide, and partly by the ſlight 
<lb/>turning in the road) rudely ſeized me.—
<lb/>I ſhrieked aloud; and the woman, who
<lb/>was but a few paces before me, began
<lb/>to remonſtrate with him—I hardly knew,
<lb/>ſo great was my terror and confuſion,
<lb/>what either of them ſaid; but upon <persName>Patten­

<lb/>ſervice to the ancient gentlewoman of the
<lb/>Hall, good Mr. favourite butler, and tell
<lb/>her, if ſhe has any commands for me, ſhe
<lb/>muſt employ one of her pretty handmaids
<lb/>(<emph>that</emph> I ſaw juſt now, if ſhe pleaſes); and ſhe
<lb/>will not fail to find for her embaſſy a more
<lb/>favourable reception than I think it neceſ­
<lb/>ſary to give your worſhip.</said> <persName>Sir John</persName> then
<lb/>laughing aloud at his own wit, in which his
<lb/>two ſervants accompanied him, put his horſe
<lb/>into a gallop, and was out of ſight in an
<lb/>inſtant; long before <persName>Pattenſon</persName>, whom rage
<lb/>and indignation did not render more active,
<lb/>had reached <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, and repeated
<lb/>this meſſage, not without ſome additions of
<lb/>his own, to his Lady. I think I never ſaw
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> ſo much diſturbed as at the
<lb/>general brutality of this rude ſtranger.
<lb/>I however ſoon recovered of my alarm,
<lb/>when I found that this very diſagreeable
<lb/>ſcene had ended without bringing on any
<lb/>converſation as to what had formerly paſſed;
<lb/>and I hoped and believed I ſhould hear no

<lb/>more of <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>. <persName>Mrs. Ray­
<lb/>land</persName>, from the agitation of ſpirits this in­
<lb/>ſult had thrown her into, was quite ill when
<lb/>ſhe got back to the Hall; but the next
<lb/>day, after ſhe had given vent to her diſ­
<lb/>pleaſure, by talking about it to my aunt
<lb/><persName>Lennard</persName>, and every one who approached
<lb/>her, ſhe ſeemed to recover; and the buſtle
<lb/>that this ridiculous man had occaſioned
<lb/>gradually died away. It happened on <name>Fri­
<lb/>day</name>, and on the following <name>Sunday</name> I had
<lb/>promiſed to meet <persName>Selina</persName>, with whom I had never
<lb/>had an opportunity of ſeeing after her re­
<lb/>turn from <placeName>London</placeName> till now. We were
<lb/>equally eager to meet each other; and
<lb/>as I have now no difficulty in obtaining
<lb/>leave to walk in the park when my aunt is
<lb/>with her Lady, I got her permiſſion to go
<lb/>out this evening, and paſſed with our
<lb/>deareſt <persName>Selina</persName> an hour, the moſt delightful
<lb/>and yet the moſt melancholy that I have
<lb/>known ſince your departure. <persName>Selina</persName> was
<lb/>afraid of being miſſed, as ſhe told me her
<lb/>father was never eaſy when ſhe was out of
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">his</mw>

<pb n="317"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">317</mw>
<lb/>his ſight; and now only ſtole out while
<lb/>he was aſleep after dinner. She left me
<lb/>therefore ſooner than either of us wiſhed;
<lb/>but after ſhe was gone I ſat ſome time
<lb/>weeping where ſhe had left me. It was
<lb/>the bench, <persName>Orlando</persName>, in the fir grove, by the
<lb/>boat-houſe, where we ſat all together when
<lb/>you made us promiſe to meet there, and
<lb/>talk of you when you ſhould be gone. All
<lb/>your ſiſter had told me of what paſ­
<lb/>ſed in <placeName>London</placeName> between your mother and
<lb/>your brother, and of your father's de­
<lb/>jected ſpirits and declining health, had
<lb/>affected me more than I can deſcribe: but
<lb/>after I had indulged my tears ſome time, I
<lb/>recollected your charge to me to keep up
<lb/>my ſpirits, and I endeavoured to conquer
<lb/>this depreſſion. The ſun was nearly ſet,
<lb/>and I went over the pond-head by the
<lb/>great caſcade, in order to go home the
<lb/>neareſt way. I had juſt paſſed through
<lb/>the high plantation, and was entering the
<lb/>park, when I ſaw this hateful <persName>Sir John Bel­
<lb/>grave</persName> approaching me.—Had I met him in
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">P3</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="P3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">318</mw>
<lb/>the path of the plantation, it would have
<lb/>been impoſſible for me to have eſcaped him;
<lb/>but now, as the park was open before me,
<lb/>I ran the inſtant I obſerved him the oppo­
<lb/>ſite way. He purſued me for ſome time,
<lb/>intreating me to ſtop, and aſſuring me that
<lb/>he meant only to beg my pardon for his
<lb/>behaviour two days before, with a great
<lb/>deal of other nonſenſe; which I did not,
<lb/>however, hear much of, for I was almoſt
<lb/>in a moment within ſight of the houſe, and
<lb/>I ſaw him turn back. I arrived quite out
<lb/>of breath, and ſadly terrified, but I dared
<lb/>not complain. After I recovered myſelf, 
<lb/>my greateſt concern was to think that I
<lb/>could never meet <placeName>Selina</placeName> without fearing a
<lb/>repetition of this diſagreeable adventure;
<lb/>but I had now nobody to liſten to my com­
<lb/>plaints, or to relieve me from my ſorrows.
<lb/>I thought the ſermon of that evening the
<lb/>moſt tedious and unintereſting I had
<lb/>ever read; and both the old ladies were
<lb/>certainly particularly ill humoured, my
<lb/>aunt more eſpecially, who was ſnappiſh
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">and</mw>

<pb n="319"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">319</mw>
<lb/>and peeviſh to ſuch a degree that ſhe
<lb/>almoſt quarrelled with <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>: but,
<lb/>as ſhe could not vent all her ſpleen on her,
<lb/>it fell upon me; and I went to bed in
<lb/>more than uſual wretchedneſs, and for the
<lb/>firſt time wiſhed that the younger <persName>Roker</persName>
<lb/>might return to the Hall—for to his having
<lb/>been two days abſent I imputed the irrita­
<lb/>bility of my poor aunt's temper.</p>
                  <p>Ah! <persName>Orlando</persName>, how dreary now ſeemed
<lb/>my own room, to which, when you were
<lb/>here, I uſed to retire with ſo much delight
<lb/>from all the diſcomforts of my lot! It
<lb/>was a lovely moon-light night, and yet
<lb/>early when I went to the turret. From
<lb/>the window I looked into the park, with
<lb/>ſenſations how different from thoſe I uſed
<lb/>to feel when I expected to ſee you croſs it!
<lb/>I was reſtleſs and wretched, and knew I 
<lb/>could not ſleep if I went to bed; or, if I
<lb/>did, I feared I ſhould dream of <persName>Sir John
<lb/>Belgrave's</persName> purſuing me. I wiſhed for ſome
<lb/>book I never had read, for you have often
<lb/>told me that nothing ſo ſoon quieted the

<pb n="320"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">320</mw>
<lb/>mind, and led the troubled ſpirit away
<lb/>from its own ſad reflections, as ſome amuſing
<lb/>or inſtructive author; but I had none in
<lb/>my room but thoſe books of your own
<lb/>that you gave me, which I had read over
<lb/>and over again; and ſince this <persName>Mr. Roker</persName>
<lb/>has occaſionally been in poſſeſſion of your
<lb/>apartment next the ſtudy, and I once met
<lb/>him as I was going thither, I have never
<lb/>had the courage to venture down after the
<lb/>books as I uſed to do. Some of the poems
<lb/>however, <persName>Orlando</persName>, that you gave me, I am
<lb/>never, never weary of reading, though I can
<lb/>ſay them almoſt by heart; and therefore,
<lb/>when I was tired of looking at the moon, I
<lb/>took up that little volume of <persName>Gray</persName>, and
<lb/>read that beautiful ode to Adverſity which
<lb/>you have ſo often bade me admire; and
<lb/>indeed I thought, <persName>Orlando</persName>, that we, though
<lb/>ſuffering under its <quote source="b:IT07606.6">iron ſcourge and tor­
<lb/>turing hour,</quote> were yet in a ſituation more
<lb/>really happy than the proſperous worthleſs
<lb/><persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>, who was able to enjoy

<lb/>dering about the world in danger and in
<lb/>ſorrow. Alas! theſe thoughts, however
<lb/>conſoling at firſt, brought on a train of
<lb/>others, and fears, the moſt terrible fears for
<lb/>your precious life aſſailed me. My fancy
<lb/>conjured up a thouſand horrid viſions, and
<lb/>dwelt on a thouſand terrible poſſibilities,
<lb/>till at length I found myſelf unable to bear
<lb/>the wretchedneſs I had thus created for
<lb/>myſelf, and I determined to attempt at
<lb/>leaſt to loſe it in ſleep; and was, from mere
<lb/>fatigue of ſpirits, beginning to doze, when
<lb/>I was ſtartled by a rap at the door at
<lb/>the back of the bed. I believed it to be
<lb/>a dream, too well recollecting that you
<lb/>were not there. When I liſtened a mo­
<lb/>ment, and the noiſe was repeated, never,
<lb/>among all the terrors I have ſuffered, did I
<lb/>feel any alarm like this—I had not courage
<lb/>to ſpeak, nor to move: my firſt idea was
<lb/>to run into my aunt's room; but then I 
<lb/>muſt have diſcovered to her what we have
<lb/>ſo anxiouſly concealed; and of which, I be­
<lb/>lieve, ſhe never had the leaſt notion; for,

<milestone unit="sig" n="P5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">322</mw>
<lb/>whatever might be her ſuſpicions of our
<lb/>meeting, ſhe never ſeemed to gueſs how.
<lb/>While I deliberated in the moſt fearful
<lb/>agitation what it would be beſt to do, the
<lb/>noiſe was made a third time, louder than
<lb/>before; and a voice called, in a half whiſper,
<lb/>Miſs! Miſs!</p>
                  <p><said rend="pre()post(”)">For God's ſake, who is there?</said> cried
<lb/>I, haſtening to dreſs myſelf. <said>You can­
<lb/>not have any buſineſs there, whoever you
<lb/>are, and I will call my aunt and the ſer­
<lb/>vants.</said></p>
                  <p><said rend="pre()post(”)">No, no, Miſs!</said> cried a man's voice
<lb/>aloud; <said>don't do that, for you will only
<lb/>betray yourſelf; I mean you no harm, but,
<lb/>on the contrary, good.—Lord, Miſs, 'tis
<lb/>only me; and I would not have frighted 
<lb/>you ſo at this time o'night if I could have
<lb/>met you by day. I have got a letter for
<lb/>you.</said></p>
                  <p>I now knew, by the voice, that it was                  
<lb/><persName>Jacob</persName>, the under game-keeper; and though
<lb/>I trembled ſtill with fear, it was mixed with a 
<lb/>ſenſation of joy, for I hoped the letter was

<pb n="323"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">323</mw>
<lb/>from you. <said>A letter!</said> ſaid I. <said>Oh, pray
<lb/>give it me inſtantly.</said> Yet I recollected, as in­
<lb/>ſtantly, that it was fooliſh to open the door.
<lb/>The man ſaid, eagerly, <said>But make haſte
<lb/>then, Miſs, and take it.</said>—<said>No,</said> anſwered
<lb/>I; <said>leave it at the door, or put it under it;
<lb/>I cannot open the door, for it is nailed up.</said>
<lb/>—<said>Ah! Miſs, Miſs!</said> 
cried the man; <said>it
<lb/>did not uſed to be nailed up when I know
<lb/>who was here.</said> This ſpeech, though I
<lb/>know not why, increaſed again the terror
<lb/>which had a little ſubſided; and his man­
<lb/>ner of ſpeaking of you gave me a confuſed
<lb/>idea that the letter was not from you.
<lb/><said>Where did you get the letter, <persName>Jacob</persName>?</said>
<lb/>ſaid I; <said>and who is it from?</said>—<said>Never
<lb/>mind that,</said> replied he, <said>it is a letter that
<lb/>will pleaſe you, I can tell you.</said>—<said>I will
<lb/>not receive it,</said> anſwered I, <said>unleſs I know
<lb/>whom it is from.</said>—<said>Pooh pooh! what a
<lb/>to-do is here!</said> ſaid the man, in a very imper­
<lb/>tinent manner—<said>Well then, if you are ſo
<lb/>ſqueamiſh all of a ſudden, I'll leave the

<lb/>letter, and will come to-morrow up the
<lb/>ſtairs the ſame way for an anſwer.</said></p>
                  <p><persName>Jacob</persName> then ſeemed to go down; and I
<lb/>thought I heard him ſhut the door of the 
<lb/>lower turret room after him; but, for the
<lb/>world, I could not have opened that of
<lb/>my room. Oh, <persName>Orlando</persName>! conſider what I
<lb/>muſt have ſuffered, from ſuppoſing there
<lb/>might be a letter lying without it; and
<lb/>that only a few pieces of half-decayed board
<lb/>were between me and the firſt intelligence
<lb/>I had received of you! Yet it was alſo
<lb/>poſſible that it might be from ſome other
<lb/>perſon, though I could not conjecture who
<lb/>ſhould write to me: but there was ſome­
<lb/>thing of impertinent aſſurance in the man­
<lb/>ner of the game-keeper that ſhocked me;
<lb/>and I well recollected that you once thought
<lb/>of our correſponding through his means,
<lb/>yet afterwards determined not to hazard it,
<lb/>and ſeemed ſorry that you had entruſted him
<lb/>ſo far. I will not attempt to deſcribe
<lb/>the ſtate of mind in which I paſſed the
<lb/>night. It was not, luckily for me, very
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">long;</mw>

<pb n="325"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">325</mw>
<lb/>long; but the ſun had riſen ſome time
<lb/>before I could acquire courage enough to
<lb/>open the door, and even then I trembled.
<lb/>But my hopes vaniſhed, or rather were
<lb/>exchanged for the moſt alarming fears, the
<lb/>moment I ſaw that if the letter contained 
<lb/>any news of you, it was not from yourſelf.
<lb/>I know not how I opened it, for I expected
<lb/>now nothing but tidings of deſpair; when,
<lb/>caſting my eyes on the name that con­
<lb/>cluded it, for I could not read the con­
<lb/>tents at that moment, I ſaw that of <persName>Sir
<lb/>John Berkely Belgrave</persName>; and though I 
<lb/>inſtantly comprehended the inſult it con­
<lb/>tained, I was relieved to find that it was
<lb/>not written by ſome friend of yours, to tell
<lb/>me what you were unable to write your­
<lb/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I will not, <persName>Orlando</persName>, copy this ridiculous
<lb/>billet; but as I was determined neither to
<lb/>anſwer it, nor to give the officious <persName>Jacob</persName>
<lb/>any excuſe to come up the ſtairs to my
<lb/>room, I thought, after ſome conſideration,
<lb/>that the beſt thing I could do would be to
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">ſpeak</mw>

<pb n="326"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">326</mw>
<lb/>ſpeak to this letter-carrier, though nothing
<lb/>could be more diſagreeable to me, unleſs
<lb/>it was his coming for an anſwer. As ſoon
<lb/>as breakfaſt was over, I ſummoned all the
<lb/>courage I could, and went out to the ſtable
<lb/>yard, where I knew it was moſt likely I 
<lb/>ſhould meet him. As ſoon as he ſaw me, he
<lb/>came eagerly towards me; and none of the 
<lb/>other men being within hearing, he ſaid, <said>I
<lb/>hope you have got an anſwer for <persName>Sir John</persName>
<lb/>to give me, Miſs?</said></p>
                  <p><said rend="pre()post(”)">No,</said> I anſwered; <said>I neither have
<lb/>an anſwer, nor ever intend to give one to
<lb/>ſo impertinent a letter; and I beg you,
<lb/><persName>Mr. Jacob</persName>, not to diſturb me any more
<lb/>with meſſages ſo very improper; for, if you
<lb/>do, it will oblige me to complain to <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Lennard</persName>.</said></p>
                  <p>The fellow had the impertinence to ſay,
<lb/>that if I would not give him an anſwer, <persName>Sir
<lb/>John</persName> would come for one himſelf; but I
<lb/>hope and believe I ſhall hear no more of 
<lb/>it, as it is now <name>Thurſday</name>, and I have had
<lb/>no more viſits. I have faſtened the door

<lb/>as well as I am able, and would ſecure that
<lb/>below if I knew how: but it is not poſſible
<lb/>for me to do it myſelf; and were I to aſk
<lb/>any other perſon, it would put whoever it
<lb/>was in poſſeſſion of the ſecret which we
<lb/>have ſo much reaſon to regret was ever
<lb/>divulged.</p>
                  <p>But do not, ever dear <persName>Orlando</persName>, be un­
<lb/>eaſy—I am perſuaded <persName>Sir John</persName> is ſatisfied
<lb/>with his frolic, and that I ſhall hear no more
<lb/>of it; indeed I believe he has left the coun­
<lb/>try; but I own I am uncomfortable at
<lb/>being ſo much in the power of ſuch a man
<lb/>as this game-keeper—However, I now leave
<lb/>half open the door into the paſſage that
<lb/>leads to my aunt's room; and, upon the
<lb/>leaſt alarm, I would fly to her, and rather
<lb/>own the truth, than ſubject myſelf to a re­
<lb/>petition of ſuch viſits, either from this
<lb/>worthleſs ſervant or his employer. Do not
<lb/>therefore, I again entreat you, my dear

<lb/>yet I feel that were I without this tender

                  <p>I will not conjure you to remember your

<lb/>not actual hunger, a great deficiency of
<lb/>nouriſhment (for the whole army had been
<lb/>ſome days on ſhort allowance), he felt
<lb/>nothing but that <persName>Monimia</persName> was liable to
<lb/>the inſults of <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>; perhaps
<lb/>already the victim of his infamous deſigns
<lb/>—an idea that flung him almoſt to mad­
<lb/>neſs. The painful news he had heard
<lb/>from his father's houſe added to the
<lb/>anguiſh of his ſpirit; and perhaps never
<lb/>was a mind more diſtracted with a variety
<lb/>of tormenting apprehenſions, not one of 
<lb/>which he had the means of alleviating.
<lb/>As ſoon as it was light the party renewed
<lb/>their journey, but had not proceeded half
<lb/>a quarter of a mile towards the thickeſt
<lb/>part of the wood before the war-whoop burſt
<lb/>forth; and a ſhower of bullets fell among
<lb/>them, wounding ſome, and killing one of
<lb/>their ſmall party. The <name>Indians</name> ruſhed
<lb/>forward the moment the <name>Engliſh</name> had at
<lb/>random fired among the trees, and <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>ſaw no more; a violent blow on the head

<lb/>deprived him of his ſenſes, and to all ap­
<lb/>pearance of his life.</p>
            <p>When he recovered his recollection, he
<lb/>found himſelf lying on the ground in one
<lb/>of thoſe temporary huts which the <name>Indians</name>
<lb/>erect in their hunting parties. It was
<lb/>night, and he heard them in loud conver­
<lb/>ſation near him—He found he was their
<lb/>priſoner, and concluded he was reſerved
<lb/>for thoſe horrid tortures of which he had
<lb/>heard ſo many terrific deſcriptions. Death
<lb/>appeared to him moſt deſirable; and his
<lb/>great hope was that he ſhould by death
<lb/>eſcape them—for the pain from the wound
<lb/>in his head was ſo exceſſive, that he doubted
<lb/>not but that his ſcull was fractured, and of
<lb/>courſe his diſſolution near.</p>
            <p>He attempted to riſe; not with any hope
<lb/>of eſcape, for that was impoſſible, but
<lb/>with a ſort of confuſed deſire to accelerate
<lb/>his fate; when an <name>Indian</name> entered the hut
<lb/>with a light, in whom <persName>Orlando</persName> diſcovered
<lb/>his former acquaintance the <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName>.</p>
            <p>This young ſavage approached and ſpoke
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">kindly</mw>

<pb n="334"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">334</mw>
<lb/>kindly to him, telling him, that though his
<lb/>brother had killed and ſcalped the reſt of
<lb/>the party, he had ſaved him, and was his
<lb/>ſworn friend—that no harm ſhould come
<lb/>to him, and that the chief had promiſed
<lb/>him his life.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> in a faint voice thanked him
<lb/>for his kindneſs, which he ſaid was too late,
<lb/>as he felt the wound in his head to be
<lb/>mortal. He then enquired why the Indian
<lb/>warriors had fallen upon a party of their
<lb/>allies and brethren, the ſoldiers of the king
<lb/>of <placeName>England</placeName>?</p>
            <p>The <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName> replied, that the
<lb/><name>Engliſh</name> had not dealt fairly with them—
<lb/>that they were promiſed proviſions, rum,
<lb/>and plunder, inſtead of which they got
<lb/>nothing in the Engliſh camp, but had loſt
<lb/>ſome of their beſt men in defending the
<lb/>lines; and that, the <name>Engliſh</name> having thus
<lb/>deceived them, they were no longer their 
<lb/>allies, but were going home to their own
<lb/>lands, determined to plunder the ſtragglers
<lb/>of whatever party they might meet in their
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">way,</mw>

<pb n="335"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="P12r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">335</mw>
<lb/>way, to make themſelves amends for the
<lb/>loſs of time, and the heavier loſs of brave
<lb/>warriors that had periſhed by believing
<lb/>the promiſes of the great Engliſh Captain.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando's</persName> generous heart bled for his
<lb/>comrades thus inhumanly ſacrificed; and
<lb/>he lamented that they, as well as himſelf,
<lb/>had not fallen like his friend <persName>Fleming</persName> in
<lb/>the field. He aſked if all the men who
<lb/>were with him had periſhed. His Indian
<lb/>friend anſwered, All but two—a white man
<lb/>and a negro—who had eſcaped while they
<lb/>were plundering the reſt.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> heard this with a ſigh of deeper
<lb/>concern; for he knew that, unleſs theſe
<lb/>unfortunate men could again croſs the
<lb/>river and regain the camp, they would
<lb/>probably die in the woods of hunger and
<lb/>fatigue. The <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName> then enquired
<lb/>of <persName>Orlando</persName>, if he thought he could march
<lb/>with them in the morning?—To which he
<lb/>anſwered, he hoped ſo; but at the ſame
<lb/>time imagined that he ſhould long before
<lb/>that time be releaſed from all his ſufferings.
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">He</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">336</mw>
<lb/>He knew, however, that to complain would
<lb/>not only be fruitleſs, but injure him in the
<lb/>opinion of his hoſt, who made light of the
<lb/>wound he had received; and telling <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> he would cure it, he cut off the hair,
<lb/>waſhed it with rum, and then laid on it a
<lb/>pledget of chewed leaves. An Indian
<lb/>blanket was thrown over him, for his own
<lb/>clothes were taken away; and the young
<lb/>ſavage giving him a drink, ſuch as they
<lb/>had themſelves been merry over, of rum,
<lb/>water and honey, deſired him to ſleep,
<lb/>and in a few moments ſet him the example.</p>
            <p>Giddy and diſturbed as was the unhappy
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> from the effects of the blow, he
<lb/>now began to awaken to a ſenſe of his
<lb/>condition; and in believing that the injury
<lb/>he had received was not of ſo fatal a nature
<lb/>as he had on the firſt ſenſation of pain
<lb/>imagined, he felt infinitely more miſerable
<lb/>in ſuppoſing that he ſhould live in ſuch in­
<lb/>ſupportable anguiſh as his fears for <persName>Mo­
<lb/>nimia</persName> and his family would inflict upon
<lb/>him—condemned probably as long as his

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">337</mw>
<lb/>life laſted, to drag on a wretched exiſtence
<lb/>among the ſavage tribes of the American
<lb/>wilderneſs, and cut off from all commu­
<lb/>nication with his country.</p>
            <p>In ſuch reflections on his own wretched­
<lb/>neſs he paſſed this miſerable night, his Indian
<lb/>protector ſoundly ſleeping in the ſame hut.
<lb/>Before the dawn of day they began to move;
<lb/>as the chief, or leader of the party, was
<lb/>anxious to eſcape, with the plunder they
<lb/>had already got, to the <name>Iroquois</name> country,
<lb/>from which they came. <persName>Orlando</persName>, contrary
<lb/>to his expectations, found he could walk;
<lb/>and his friend the <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName>, pleaſed
<lb/>with the reſolution he exerted, ſometimes
<lb/>aſſiſted him when he appeared on the point
<lb/>of failing in this rapid and difficult march,
<lb/>through a country known and acceſſible only
<lb/>to <name>Indians</name>. His ſhoes and ſtockings had been
<lb/>taken from him, and his feet bled at every
<lb/>ſtep: but he went on in a ſort of deſpera­
<lb/>tion, hoping that the more ſevere his ſuf­
<lb/>ferings were, the ſooner they would end;
<lb/>nor was it the leaſt of theſe, that, on the

<lb/>firſt dawn of morning, he ſaw the ſcalps of 
<lb/>his unfortunate comrades triumphantly
<lb/>carried by the chief of the party, whoſe title
<lb/>was the <persName>Wild Elk</persName>.</p>
            <p>New ſcenes of horror awaited him on
<lb/>his way. As plunder was now the avowed
<lb/>purpoſe of this party of <name>Iroquois</name>, which
<lb/>consisted of near forty men, they attacked
<lb/>the defenceleſs villages of the <name>Engliſh
<lb/>Americans</name>, whoſe men were out with the
<lb/>army; and deſtroyed the women and chil­
<lb/>dren, or led them away to captivity infi­
<lb/>nitely worſe than death. Some few the
<lb/><persName>Wolf-hunter</persName>, who was the ſecond in power,
<lb/>was influenced by the entreaties of <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>to ſpare; but even theſe were, he feared,
<lb/>reſerved only for a more lingering and de­
<lb/>plorable fate; and in fact many hundreds
<lb/>of the unhappy people, thus driven from
<lb/>their dwellings in the courſe of the war,
<lb/>periſhed by famine in the woods and
<lb/>gullies.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> was now nearly recovered of
<lb/>the wound in his head, notwithſtanding ſo

<lb/>rude a method of cure; but, in fact, the
<lb/>ſkull had not been injured. The blow
<lb/>was given with the butt end of a muſket,
<lb/>and not with a tomahawk, whoſe wounds
<lb/>are almoſt always mortal. His friend the
<lb/><persName>Wolf-hunter</persName> had equipped him like an
<lb/>Indian warrior. His fine hair was cut off,
<lb/>all but a long lock on the crown of his
<lb/>head—and he was diſtinguiſhed from an
<lb/><name>Iroquois</name> by nothing but his Engliſh com­
<lb/>plexion. In theſe circumſtances, after a 
<lb/>long and fatiguing march of eleven days,
<lb/>he arrived with his protector at the camp
<lb/>or rendezvous of thoſe <name>Indians</name> who had
<lb/>taken up the hatchet as allies to the king
<lb/>of <placeName>England</placeName>, where they halted, and held
<lb/>a general council. A party, who had juſt
<lb/>arrived before them, brought intelligence
<lb/>of the <name>convention of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName></name>, ſo fatal to
<lb/>the <name>Britiſh</name>, and their German allies: in
<lb/>conſequence of this, one body of the <name>In­
<lb/>dians</name> returned again towards the ſeat of
<lb/>war, on a ſcheme of general depredation;

<lb/>hunter</persName>, who carried every where with him
<lb/>his Engliſh friend, went to the town of
<lb/>their diſtrict, with an intention of recruit­
<lb/>ing their numbers, and falling upon the
<lb/>back ſettlements while they were in their
<lb/>preſent defenceleſs ſtate.</p>
            <p>The ground was now every where frozen;
<lb/>and their way ſeemed to lay over ſharpened
<lb/>flints—ſo impenetrable it was become.
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> was enured to every perſonal ſuf­
<lb/>fering: but thoſe of the unhappy victims
<lb/>of this war—victims that every day ſeemed
<lb/>to multiply around him, and very few of
<lb/>whom he could ſave, were a continual ſource
<lb/>of torment to him; while, at every pauſe
<lb/>of theſe horrors, the fears of what might
<lb/>happen, perhaps had already happened
<lb/>at home, were even more dreadful than
<lb/>his actual miſeries. He found that <persName>Perſeus</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Warwick's</persName> black ſervant that had attended
<lb/>him, was among thoſe who eſcaped from
<lb/>his unfortunate party: if he did not fall a 
<lb/>victim to hunger, or failed of being de­
<lb/>ſtroyed by ſome other wandering horde

<lb/>of ſavages, he might, as he was a ſtout
<lb/>man, enured to hardſhip, and of good
<lb/>courage, find his way to <placeName>New-York</placeName>, and
<lb/>from thence to <placeName>England</placeName>, where he would
<lb/>undoubtedly report to <persName>Mr. Somerive</persName> and
<lb/>his diſtracted family, that he ſaw <persName>Orlando</persName>
<lb/>die under the hands of an <name>Indian</name>. The
<lb/>wretchedneſs that ſuch news would inflict 
<lb/>on his friends, on his <persName>Monimia</persName>, there was 
<lb/>no likelihood of his being able to remove;
<lb/>for, in his preſent ſituation, there was no
<lb/>means of conveying a letter with any hope
<lb/>of its ever reaching the place of its de­
<lb/>ſtination. He tried to prevail on his ſavage
<lb/>friend to let him go with the party who
<lb/>were returning towards <placeName>Boſton</placeName>, in hopes
<lb/>that he might eſcape from them, and find
<lb/>his way alone to ſome fort either of <name>Eng­
<lb/>liſh Americans</name> or <name>Engliſh</name>: but this, for
<lb/>reaſons which <persName>Orlando</persName> did not altogether

<lb/>village, it was the end of <name>November</name>; and
<lb/>the winter ſet in with ſuch ſeverity that the
<lb/><name>Indians</name>, however eager after plunder, felt
<lb/>but little diſpoſed to encounter its rigour.
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> then ſaw that the dreary months
<lb/>between <name>November</name> and <name>April</name> he muſt be
<lb/>condemned to paſs among theſe barbarians,
<lb/>deprived of all human intercourſe, and in
<lb/>a kind of living death. Even if he could
<lb/>have forced his mind from the conſider­
<lb/>ation of his own diſaſtrous ſituation, to
<lb/>contemplate the wonderful variety which
<lb/>Nature exhibits, and to have explored
<lb/>theſe wild ſcenes, this reſource was denied
<lb/>him; for the whole country was a wide waſte
<lb/>of ſnow, and every thing around him
<lb/>ſeemed cold and hopeleſs as his own 
<lb/>deſtiny.</p>
            <p>The booty which the <name>Indians</name> had divided
<lb/>at their camp compriſed, among other
<lb/>articles, a ſmall port folio of his, a memo­
<lb/>randum book, his pocket book, and a writ­
<lb/>ing caſe: theſe had fallen to the ſhare of 
<lb/>his friend the <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName>, who was very
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">willing</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">343</mw>
<lb/>willing to reſtore to <persName>Orlando</persName> things of ſo 
<lb/>little uſe to himſelf. This was the only
<lb/>alleviation the unhappy <persName>Orlando</persName> found to
<lb/>his ſorrows; yet it was a melancholy one,
<lb/>to write letters which he could hardly ex­
<lb/>pect would ever be read, to make for his
<lb/>father a journal of occurrences ſo mourn­
<lb/>ful, and to feel, while he wrote it, that it
<lb/>was too probable the eye for which it was
<lb/>intended was cloſed for ever.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of <persName>Orlando</persName> were ſuch as
<lb/>time, the great ſoftener of moſt affliction,
<lb/>ſerved only to aggravate. What would he
<lb/>have given for even a hope of hearing
<lb/>from <placeName>England</placeName>! and how many conjectures
<lb/>were continually paſſing through his mind,
<lb/>each more diſtreſſing than another! In
<lb/>his dreams, he often ſaw his <persName>Monimia</persName> pur­
<lb/>ſued by <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName> entreating his
<lb/>protection, and he ſtarted up to chaſtiſe the
<lb/>inhuman perſecutor of her innocence. At
<lb/>other times fancy, more favourable, repre­
<lb/>ſented her as ſhe uſed to appear in the early
<lb/>days of their attachment—cheerful, becauſe

<lb/>unconſcious of having erred—and tenderly
<lb/>truſting to him, even when ſhe diſcovered
<lb/>that their clandeſtine meetings were con­
<lb/>trary to the ſtrict line of duty and pro­
<lb/>priety. He heard her voice—he admired
<lb/>her ſimple beauty, her innocent tenderneſs,
<lb/>the ſtrength and candour of her uncul­
<lb/>tivated underſtanding—and ſuppoſed him­
<lb/>ſelf engaged, as he uſed to be, in the de­
<lb/>lightful taſk of improving it. Dreary was
<lb/>the contraſt between his real ſituation and 
<lb/>theſe ſoothing viſions; and he often pre­
<lb/>ferred ſuch as gave him ſleeping torment,
<lb/>to ſuch as by flattering with happineſs ren­
<lb/>dered more inſupportable the deſpair
<lb/>which conſumed him.</p>
            <p>Five weeks, five miſerable and dreary
<lb/>weeks had now crept away; when ſome­
<lb/>thing like a change of ideas was offered by
<lb/>the arrival of two <name>French Canadians</name> and a

<lb/>had travelled acroſs the ſnows and frozen

<lb/>—and of this the young ſoldier of late had
<lb/>ſo little, that the leaſt glimpſe of more
<lb/>reſtored his dejected ſpirits; which, when

<lb/>bered, it will be acknowledged that no­

<lb/>enabled him ſo long to ſupport.</p>
            <p>On ſounding his ſavage protector, who
<lb/>was extremely attached to him, he found
<lb/>it ſeemed not very unlikely that he might

<lb/>to <placeName>Quebec</placeName> to trade early in the ſpring,
<lb/>hunting or fighting on their way as occa­
<lb/>ſion might offer. His Canadian friends
<lb/>encouraged this plan; and <persName>Orlando</persName> ven­
<lb/>tured to promiſe a conſiderable preſent of
<lb/>ſpirits from the governor of <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, as an
<lb/>acknowledgment for the reſtoration of an
<lb/>Engliſh officer; and made many promiſes
<lb/>to the <persName>Wolf-hunter</persName>, of ſending him from
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName> what ſhould give him a great ſu­
<lb/>periority over all his countrymen, if he
<lb/>would releaſe him, and promote his return
<lb/>to <placeName>Europe</placeName>. The means of conciliating this
<lb/>his Indian maſter, and procuring his con­
<lb/>ſent to a ſcheme that he formerly ſeemed
<lb/>ſo averſe to, were ſuggeſted to him by his
<lb/>new Canadian friends and promiſed to be
<lb/>ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Thus relieved by hope, the months of
<lb/><name>January</name>, <name>February</name>, and <name>March</name>, paſſed leſs
<lb/>heavily. The Spring, which in <placeName>America</placeName>

<lb/>the whole country was covered with ver­
<lb/>dure and burſt into bloom. A thouſand
<lb/>birds filled the extenſive foreſts, as gay in
<lb/>their plumage as exquiſite in their ſong;
<lb/>and, whichever way <persName>Orlando</persName> looked, a 
<lb/>new <placeName>Eden</placeName> ſeemed to be opening around

            <p>On the <date when="1778-04-20">20th of <name>April</name> 1778</date>, <persName>Orlando</persName>,
<lb/>the <name>French Canadians</name>, and the <persName>Wolf-
<lb/>hunter</persName> leading a party of five-and-twenty
<lb/>Indian warriors, ſet out for <placeName>Quebec</placeName>—the
<lb/><name>Indians</name> carrying great quantities of furs,
<lb/>the ſpoils of the animals they had taken
<lb/>during the Winter. Of theſe <persName>Orlando</persName> car­
<lb/>ried his ſhare; and now, re-animated by
<lb/>the ſoothing expectation of being reſtored
<lb/>to his country, he endeavoured to con­
<lb/>form himſelf to the modes of his ſavage
<lb/>hoſts, and was indeed become almoſt as
<lb/>expert an hunter, in their own methods,
<lb/>as the moſt active among them.</p>
            <p>They had travelled ſome hundred miles,
<lb/>and were within a few days journey of

<lb/><placeName>Quebec</placeName>, when it was reſolved by the <persName>Wolf-
<lb/>hunter</persName> to encamp for ſome days, in a ſpot
<lb/>particularly favourable to hunting. This de­
<lb/>termination, however unpleaſing to <persName>Or­
<lb/>lando</persName> he knew was not to be diſputed; and,
<lb/>though every delay was death to him, he
<lb/>was compelled to ſubmit to what no re­
<lb/>monſtrance would avert.</p>
            <p>The camp, therefore, was formed; and
<lb/>if any local circumſtance could have recon­
<lb/>ciled him to the procraſtination of a jour­
<lb/>ney on which all the hopes of his deliver­

<lb/>vity depended, it was the very uncommon
<lb/>beauty of the ſcenery amid which theſe

            <p>This was on the banks of the river <placeName>St.

<lb/>where they encamped were of an immenſe

<lb/>into inſignificance. On the oppoſite ſide
<lb/>of the river lay an extenſive ſavannah,
<lb/>alive with cattle, and coloured with ſuch a
<lb/>variety of ſwamp plants, that their colour,
<lb/>even at that diſtance, detracted ſomething
<lb/>from the vivid green of the new ſprung
<lb/>graſs: beyond this the eye was loſt in a
<lb/>rich and various landſcape, quite unlike
<lb/>any thing that European proſpects offer;
<lb/>and the acclivity on which the tents ſtood
<lb/>ſinking very ſuddenly on the left, the high

<lb/>low ground, entirely filled with theſe trees;
<lb/>while on the right the rocks, riſing ſud­
<lb/>denly and ſharply, were clothed with
<lb/>wood of various ſpecies; the ever-green
<lb/>oak, the ſcarlet oak, the tulip tree, and
<lb/>magnolia, ſeemed bound together by feſ­
<lb/>toons of flowers, ſome reſembling the con­

<lb/>theſe fragrant wreaths that wound about
<lb/>the trees, tufts of rhododendron and azalea,
<lb/>of andromedas and calmias, grew in the

<lb/>already ripening, or even ripe, peeped

<lb/>whoſe cry is believed by the <name>Indians</name> al­

<lb/>ill tidings; piercing, and often repeated,
<lb/>it was echoed back from the woods; and
<lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, once rouſed to a compariſon be­
<lb/>tween his viſionary and his real ſituation,
<lb/>was alive to the keeneſt ſenſations of ſorrow.
<lb/>The hateful noiſe ſtill continued, and he
<lb/>went out of his tent, for he knew any far­
<lb/>ther attempt to ſleep would be vain—Alas!
<lb/>the turrets of <name>Rayland Hall</name> were no longer
<lb/>painted on his imagination—inſtead of them
<lb/>he looked perpendicularly down on a hol­
<lb/>low, where the dark knots of cypreſs ſeem­
<lb/>ed, by the dim light of early morning,
<lb/>which threatened ſtorms, to repreſent groups
<lb/>of ſupernatural beings in funereal habits;
<lb/>and over them he ſaw, ſlowly ſailing amid
<lb/>the miſt that aroſe from the ſwamp, two or
<lb/>three of the birds which had ſo diſturbed
<lb/>him. Great volumes of heavy fog ſeemed
<lb/>to be rolling from the river, and the ſun
<lb/>appeared red and lurid through the heavy
<lb/>atmoſphere. <persName>Orlando</persName> endeavoured to ſhake
<lb/>off the uncomfortable ſenſations, which, in

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> referred himſelf to his Excellency

          <lb/>emabrked five weeks after his arrival at
          <lb/><placeName>Quebec</placeName>. He took leave of his Iroquois
          <lb/>protector, with a thouſand proteſtations
          <lb/>of gratitude for all the ſervices he had
          <lb/>rendered him, and promiſed to remit

            <p>His captivity was, however, much leſs
          <lb/>terrible than that he had formerly ſuſ­

          <lb/>officers all thoſe attentions which, among
          <lb/>civilized nations, ought to ſoften the hor­

            <p>Had the <persName>Chevalier de Stainville</persName> been

          <lb/>but he places his Engliſh friend in the

          <lb/>eternal regret, his return to his native
          <lb/>country.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>St. Malo</placeName> he could not find the
          <lb/>conveyance he ſought, and therefore jour­
          <lb/>neyed along the coaſt in as cheap a man­
          <lb/>ner as he could to <placeName>Havre</placeName>; but, there
          <lb/>being no open communication now be­
          <lb/>tween <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>England</placeName>, he found the
          <lb/>accommodation he wanted extremely diffi­
          <lb/>cult to obtain, and it was not till almoſt the
          <lb/>end of October that he found means to
          <lb/>engage a large fiſhing-bark, which un­
          <lb/>der that pretence was employed in ſmug­
          <lb/>gling on the coaſt, to land him at <placeName>South­
          <lb/>ampton</placeName>; and this bargain was made at the
          <lb/>price of all the money he had, with a
          <lb/>promiſe of a farther reward if he arrived
          <lb/>ſafely at an Engliſh port, where he
          <lb/>doubted not but that, upon making him­
          <lb/>ſelf known, he ſhould find friends who
          <lb/>would enable him to fulfil his promiſes.
          <lb/>There was conſiderable hazard to his
          <lb/>conductors in attempting to land at any
          <lb/>port of <placeName>Hampſhire</placeName>, when ſo many veſ­

          <lb/>ſels lay at <placeName>Portſmouth;</placeName> an hazard on
          <lb/>which they took care to inſiſt with great
          <lb/>vehemence, after they had got their paſ­
          <lb/>ſenger on board. <persName>Orlando</persName>, who had in­
          <lb/>finitely rather have been landed on the
          <lb/>coaſt of <placeName>Suffex</placeName>, propoſed to them to 
          <lb/>make for ſome part of that country; but
          <lb/>even this propoſal did not ſeem to pleaſe
          <lb/>them, and two of the three men appeared
          <lb/>to be very ſurly and ſavage.</p>
            <p>They agreed, however, to go up the
          <lb/>Channel; and the wind, though very high,
          <lb/>ſerved them for the purpoſe. It was al­
          <lb/>ready night when they adopted this reſolu­

          <lb/>doubled, entreated them there to put him
          <lb/>on ſhore; but this they refuſed, as they
          <lb/>alledged that their bark would there be in

          <lb/>and ſeized by the veſſels cruizing round
          <lb/>the iſland; and their only way was to
          <lb/>haul off the Engliſh coaſt, and affect to

          <lb/>tiſed in theſe ſort of deceptions, and
          <lb/>having no remedy even if he had not
          <lb/>approved of their plan, ſubmitted to do
          <lb/>whatever they thought ſafeſt.</p>
            <p>They kept, therefore, as near their own
          <lb/>coaſt as if they had intended landing
          <lb/>there; but towards evening, the wind
          <lb/>being ſtill ſtrong and favourable, they
          <lb/>ſtretched away for the <placeName>Suffex</placeName> coaſt, and
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw the land where all his hopes
          <lb/>repoſed!――He was little diſpoſed to diſ­
          <lb/>pute with theſe men any terms they now
          <lb/>wiſhed to impoſe upon him; but he be­
          <lb/>gan to think them very unreaſonable,
          <lb/>when they told him that, as he muſt land at
          <lb/>night, and on the open coaſt, he could
          <lb/>not pary them the farther reward he had
          <lb/>promiſed them on his getting ſafely on
          <lb/>ſhore; and, therefore, they expect that
          <lb/>he would make up to them that failiure, by

          <lb/>giving up part of his baggage. This was
          <lb/>ſo little, after the caſual ſupplies he had
          <lb/>received at <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and at <placeName>Breſt</placeName>, that, as
          <lb/>he was now within a few miles of his home,
          <lb/>it appeared to him no object. But if he
          <lb/>had more tenaciouſly intended to preſerve
          <lb/>his little wardrobe, it could not have been
          <lb/>attempted without raſhneſs. He was alone,
          <lb/>and unarmed, in the boat with three very
          <lb/>ſtout fellows, who were anſwerable for his
          <lb/>life to nobody, and who might, with ſafety
          <lb/>to themſelves, have thrown him overboard.
          <lb/>He yielfed, therefore, to this robbery
          <lb/>with as good a grace as he could; and
          <lb/>at ſunſet, in a ſtormy evening at the be­
          <lb/>ginning of November, he was ſet on ſhore
          <lb/>between <placeName>Shoreham</placeName> and <placeName>Worthing</placeName>, with
          <lb/>two pieces of twelve ſous in one pocket,

          <lb/>rapacious wretches; but, fortunately per­
          <lb/>haps for both of them and for himſelf, this
          <lb/>his only weapon had ſlipt from under his
          <lb/>arm as he was violently ſtaggered by a
          <lb/>ſudden toſſing of the boat, and, to the
          <lb/>vexation of his guides, who meant to
          <lb/>make it their prize, it fell overboard
          <lb/>and was irrecoverably loſt. All the other
          <lb/>articles of his little property, which they
          <lb/>coveted, he granted them very readily:
          <lb/>with theſe petty acquiſitions they hurried
          <lb/>from the Engliſh coaſt, and were very
          <lb/>ſoon out of ſight. <persName>Orlando</persName>, who had
          <lb/>waded through a heavy ſurf to the land,
          <lb/>kiſſed the beloved ſoil the moment he
          <lb/>reached it; and was unconſcious that he
          <lb/>was half drowned, and knew not where to
          <lb/>lay his head. To be on Engliſh ground,
          <lb/>to be within a few miles of his native place,
          <lb/>was happineſs he ſo little expected ever to
          <lb/>have enjoyed, that the tumult of his ſpi­
          <lb/>rits would not give him leave for ſome
          <lb/>time to think of any thing elſe. He was,

          <lb/>however, ſo breathleſs, and ſo much agi­
          <lb/>tated by his bodily exertion, and the va­
          <lb/>rious ſenſations of his mind, that he ſat
          <lb/>down a moment to recollect and compoſe
          <lb/>himſelf.</p>
            <p>It was not yet ſo dark but that he
          <lb/>knew nearly where he was; but it was
          <lb/>neceſſary to proceed along the ſhore to
          <lb/>ſome town or village, where he might
          <lb/>procure an horſe, on which he meant to
          <lb/>haſten inſtantly to the Hall. The village
          <lb/>of <placeName>Worthing</placeName> was the neareſt to the place
          <lb/>where he wiſhed to be. He walked there­
          <lb/>fore along the ſands; but a ſtorm from
          <lb/>the ſouth-weſt, which had been long threat­
          <lb/>ening, now came on with ſuch violence
          <lb/>that he took the firſt ſhelter he could find,
          <lb/>in a little alehouſe built under the low
          <lb/>cliffs, and ſerving as a receptacle for the
          <lb/>inferior contraband trader, or thoſe of
          <lb/>even a more humble deſcription.</p>
            <p>A light, however, invited him into a
          <lb/>place than which nothing could be more
          <lb/>dreary and deſolate, and the group he

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">14</mw>
          <lb/>found around a fire in a miſerable little
          <lb/>room black with ſmoke, and filled with
          <lb/>the fumes of tobacco and gin, did not con­
          <lb/>tribute to give him a more favourable idea
          <lb/>of this receptacle: but he had lived near
          <lb/>ten months among the <name>Iroquois</name>; and evil
          <lb/>is only by compariſon. He ſaw that his
          <lb/>entrance very much diſturbed the people
          <lb/>who were aſſembled here. Some took
          <lb/>him for a <name>Frenchman</name>, and ſome for an
          <lb/>Exciſeman; two beings extremely obnox­
          <lb/>ious, it ſeems, to ſome or other of the party.
          <lb/>All agreed that he was a ſpy, and heartily
          <lb/>wiſhed him away.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> now ſpoke to the landlady, and
          <lb/>begged of her to give him ſomething to
          <lb/>eat; for he had fared very ill on board the
          <lb/>fiſhing-boat. To this, and to his requeſt
          <lb/>that he might be allowed to dry his clothers
          <lb/>by her fire, ſhe anſwered in a way which
          <lb/>convinced <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhe doubted his power
          <lb/>of paying for the acoommodation he de­
          <lb/>ſired. To remove an objection ſo natural,
          <lb/>and ſo incontrovertible, he put his hand

          <lb/>into his pocket, and produced two pieces,
          <lb/>which the hoſteſs, not a novice in the value
          <lb/>of French money, knew was hardly equal in
          <lb/>amount to an Engliſh ſhilling. This
          <lb/>(and <persName>Orlando</persName> had actually forgotten that
          <lb/>it was all he poſſeſſed) was, however
          <lb/>moderate, enough to pay for the coarſe
          <lb/>repaſt he expected:  but the woman
          <lb/>ſeemed more diſcontent than before, and
          <lb/>the people ſurveyed him with eyes more
          <lb/>ſeverely ſcrutinizing; being convinced he
          <lb/>was a French ſpy, or ſome perſon whoſe
          <lb/>appearance there boded them no good:
          <lb/>and theſe their ſuſpicions, now that they
          <lb/>found he was poor, they very openly
          <lb/>profeſſed; and the lanlady, telling him
          <lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">ſhe never took no French money, not
            <lb/>ſhe――nore let folks bide in her houſe as ſhe

          <lb/>deſired him to walk out: a requeſt with
          <lb/>which, though the ſtorm continued with
          <lb/>ſome violence, <persName>Orlando</persName> found it neceſſary

          <lb/>to comply; and, fatigued as he was, de­
          <lb/>termined to attempt finding his way
          <lb/>through the darkneſs and the tempeſt
          <lb/>to <placeName>Shoreham</placeName>, where he thought there
          <lb/>muſt be ſome perſon who would believe
          <lb/>his ſtory, and aſſiſt him for ſo ſhort a
          <lb/>journey as he had to perform.</p>
            <p>In this reſolution he ſet our to go back
          <lb/>the way he came; but mortified that ſuch
          <lb/>brutiſh inhoſpitality as what he had juſt
          <lb/>experienced could exiſt in Britiſh boſoms,
          <lb/>and lamenting that there were <name>Engliſhmen</name>
          <lb/>leſs humane than the ruſe ſavages of the
          <lb/>wilds of <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Cold, hungry, wet, and fatigued, he
          <lb/>purſued his walk: it was ſoon ſo extremely
          <lb/>dark that he could not diſtinguiſh the
          <lb/>cliff, on which he was walking, from the
          <lb/>beach over which it fung. The rain,
          <lb/>driven with violence, almoſt blinded him,
          <lb/>and the roaring of the wind and ſea deaf­
          <lb/>ened him. Hardly able to ſtand againſt
          <lb/>the tempeſt, he frequently ſtopped, debat­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">17</mw>
          <lb/>ing whether he had not better await the
          <lb/>return of morning before he attempted to
          <lb/>proceed.</p>
            <p>His impatience, however, to get to <name>Ray­
          <lb/>land Hall</name>, conquered every idea of preſent
          <lb/>danger――and he went on, contending againſt
          <lb/>the united oppoſition of darkneſs and ſtorm.
          <lb/>After a walk of above a mile, he was
          <lb/>nearly overcome with fatigue and cold,
          <lb/>when lights, which he thought he diſtin­
          <lb/>guiſhed through the comfortleſs gloom,
          <lb/>animated him to new exertions, and he
          <lb/>went on.</p>
            <p>His hope did not deceive him; but, in
          <lb/>the eagerneſs to purſue it, he forgot the pre­
          <lb/>caution with which he had walked before,
          <lb/>and fell headlong from the top to the bot­
          <lb/>tom of the cliff, which forunately for him
          <lb/>was not at this place above ten or twelve
          <lb/>feet deep, and he reached the bottom,
          <lb/>without breaking any of his limbs, at the
          <lb/>expence of ſome contuſions. Recovering
          <lb/>immediately from the ſurprize, he found

<milestone unit="sig" n="B9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">18</mw>
          <lb/>himſelf able to walk; and kept along the
          <lb/>cliff till he reached the town, which was
          <lb/>not till between twelve and one.</p>
            <p>It was then with ſome difficulty that he
          <lb/>diſcovered a houſe of public entertainment;
          <lb/>and when he did, it was with more diffi­
          <lb/>culty ſtill he obtained admittance. At
          <lb/>length, after telling his ſtory, which the
          <lb/>man who heard it did not ſeem to
          <lb/>believe, he was ſuffered to enter the
          <lb/>kitchen of an abode between an inn and
          <lb/>an alehouſe; where ſome embers of fire
          <lb/>were renerwed, and where, though ſuſpi­
          <lb/>cion evidently appeared to be very unfa­
          <lb/>vourable to him, the man who had let him
          <lb/>in brought him ſome cold meat, beer and
          <lb/>bread, none of it of a very promiſing
          <lb/>appearance, but ſuch as his hunger made
          <lb/>extremely welcome. This being appeaſed,
          <lb/>he enquired if he might have a bed, as
          <lb/>he could go no farther that night. There
          <lb/>either was no bed, or the perſon to whom
          <lb/>he ſpoke thought him a traveller whom

<milestone unit="sig" n="B10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">19</mw>
          <lb/>it was unſafe to admit to one; for this
          <lb/>man anſwered drily, that they made up no
          <lb/>beds in that houſe; but that he might go
          <lb/>into the ſtable, where there was plenty of
          <lb/>clean ſtraw. There ſeemed to be no alter­
          <lb/>native, as the man objected to his propoſal
          <lb/>of ſitting by the fire all night. To the
          <lb/>ſtable, therefore, the unhappy wanderer
          <lb/>was led, and in his wet cloaths threw him­
          <lb/>ſelf down on the ſtraw in one of the
          <lb/>ſtalls; where, in deſpite of his uncomfort­
          <lb/>able ſituation, extreme fatigue gave him
          <lb/>up to ſleep.</p>
            <p>The noiſe of men entering to take care
          <lb/>of their horſes awakened him at the early
          <lb/>dawn of the morning; and awakened
          <lb/>him to ſuch a ſenſe of pain, from the
          <lb/>bruiſes he had received, and the damp
          <lb/>clothes in which he had lain, that it was
          <lb/>with ſome difficulty he was able to move
          <lb/>from his ſtraw into the kitchen, where he
          <lb/>had been the night before. Two ſailors
          <lb/>were drinking there, who, having nothing
          <lb/>elſe to do, began queſtioning the ſtranger.

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> related in a few words his melan­
          <lb/>choly adventures, and ſaw that theſe honeſt
          <lb/>fellows not only believed him, but pitied
          <lb/>his diſtreſs, and wiſhed to contribute to
          <lb/>his relief. His ſufferings were now
          <lb/>ſo acute, from the bruiſes received in
          <lb/>his fall, that all his fortitude could not
          <lb/>conceal them. One of his new friends
          <lb/>went to get him <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">ſomething comfort­
          <lb/>able,</said> which in his opinion was a large
          <lb/>glaſs of ſpirits; while the other aſſiſted 
          <lb/>him in drying his clothes, which were ſtill
          <lb/>wet; and as during this operation <persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName> ſurveyed himſelf in a little looking-
          <lb/>glaſs ſtuck againſt the wall, he found, in
          <lb/>the appearance he made, ſome excuſe for
          <lb/>the coldneſs of his reception the night
          <lb/>before.</p>
            <p>His face was covered with blood and
          <lb/>dirt, for his noſe had bled from the fall;
          <lb/>an old hat, which his pirate-fiſherman had
          <lb/>given him in place of a very good one they
          <lb/>took, had been torn at the ſame time, and
          <lb/>ſeemed only half a hat; his great coat

          <lb/>was gone, and his coat was French; his
          <lb/>waiſtcoat being the only part of his dreſs
          <lb/>that was the ſame as he brought from
          <lb/><placeName>Quebec</placeName>. He had no buckles in his ſhoes,
          <lb/>for the fiſhermen had deſired them; and
          <lb/>his hair, which had not had time to grow
          <lb/>long ſince his coiffure, was in the mode
          <lb/>of the <name>Iroquois</name>, and now preſented what is
          <lb/>called a ſhock head. Having amended
          <lb/>his appearance as much as he could, he
          <lb/>enquired if he could have an horſe? but he
          <lb/>was told that none were let there, nor did
          <lb/>they know of any to be had in the town.
          <lb/>By this time ſeveral other men were aſ­
          <lb/>ſembled in the kitchen; and the ſame en­
          <lb/>quiry being renewed, one of them ſaid,
          <lb/>that he could let him have a horſe for fif­
          <lb/>teen ſhillings: but then how was it to come 
          <lb/>back? and beſides, he muſt be paid for it
          <lb/>upon the ſpot. This <persName>Orlando</persName> at once con­

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> then determined to ſet out on
          <lb/>foot<unclear>.</unclear> The very little money he had in his
          <lb/>pocket was inſufficiennt to pay for even ſuch
          <lb/>entertainment as he had had, and he pro­
          <lb/>poſed leaving the ſhirt he had in his pocket
          <lb/>as a pledge for the reſt, when the two
          <lb/>honeſt ſeamen offered to diſcharge his reck­
          <lb/>oning between them, and even to lend
          <lb/>him each a ſhilling to carry him home­
          <lb/>ward――an offer he without heſitation
          <lb/>accepted; made amemorandum of their
          <lb/>names, as he doubted not of having an
          <lb/>immediate opportunity, not only of repay­
          <lb/>ing them, but of returning their kindneſs
          <lb/>fourfold; and then he ſet out on foot,
          <lb/>notwithſtanding the pain he ſuffered,
          <lb/>taking leave of the honeſt tars with many
          <lb/>ackowledgments, and given them his
          <lb/>addreſs at <name>Rayland-Hall</name>. He was told
          <lb/>that a ſtage would paſs along about eleven
          <lb/>o'clock; which, if he did not miſs it by
          <lb/>getting out of the high-road, would carry
          <lb/>him ſome part of the ſeventeen or eighteen

          <lb/>miles that was between him and the place
          <lb/>where he wiſhed to be. This route was
          <lb/>farther about; but he determined to purſue
          <lb/>it, becauſe he found himſelf unable to walk
          <lb/>with his uſual activity; nor could any leſs
          <lb/>forcible inducement than the exceſſive
          <lb/>impatience he felt to be at the Hall, have
          <lb/>ſupported him in ſuch an undertaking,
          <lb/>worn out as he was with the fatigue he had
          <lb/>ſuſtained, and his limbs almoſt diſlocated
          <lb/>by the injuries he had received the night
          <lb/>before.</p>
            <p>His progreſs was ſlow; and when at
          <lb/>length the ſtage, by which he had been
          <lb/>promiſed a conveyance part of the way,
          <lb/>overtook him, he found it carried only ſo
          <lb/>ſmall a part of his way that he had then
          <lb/>ſeven miles to walk. He knew that, by
          <lb/>going over the downs, he could reach <name>Ray­
          <lb/>land Hall</name> by a nearer way than continuing
          <lb/>along the turnpike high-road; and there­
          <lb/>fore, quitting the vehicle, he again pro­
          <lb/>ceeded on foot.</p>

            <p>So little was he able to walk as he uſed
          <lb/>to do, that, as the days were now ſhort,
          <lb/>it was almoſt duſk before he reached the
          <lb/>top of an high chalky down――the ſame
          <lb/>where, on his departure, he had taken a
          <lb/>laſt look of the place that contained all that
          <lb/>was dear to him――and he again beheld it,
          <lb/>its antique grey towers riſing among the
          <lb/>fading woods: he diſtinguiſhed the turret;
          <lb/>and recollecting that ſo long a ſpace had
          <lb/>intervened ſince he left there the object ſo
          <lb/>dear to his ſoul, and how many diſtreſſing
          <lb/>circumſtances might have occurred within
          <lb/>that time to deſtroy all his happineſs, he
          <lb/>became breathleſs through exceſs of agi­
          <lb/>tation, and was under the neceſſity of ſitting
          <lb/>down on the turf to recover himſelf.</p>
            <p>Beyond the Hall, which was within a
          <lb/>mile and a half of the foot of the hill, he
          <lb/>diſtinguiſhed the country round <placeName>Weſt Wol­
          <lb/>verton</placeName>:――the houſe was concealed; but a

          <lb/>offices, were clearly diſcernible. With ſenſa­
          <lb/>tions of mingled dreead and delight he ſur­
          <lb/>veyed the well known ſpot. <said xml:id="smiv001">Dear paternal
            <lb/>houſe,</said> cried he, <said xml:id="smiv002">in what ſituation
            <lb/>do I return to your aſylum!――but of
            <lb/>how little conſequence is that if your be­
            <lb/>loved inhabitants are well!――Oh, my
            <lb/>father! are you now thinking of your
            <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, unconſcious that he is within a
            <lb/>few miles of you? The ſon whom you
            <lb/>perhaps regret as dead is returning――a

            <p>When, in indulging theſe mixed ſenſa­

          <lb/>breath and his reſolution, he deſcended

          <lb/>at one of thoſe gates of <placeName>Rayland Park</placeName>
          <lb/>where there was no lodge. He found it

          <lb/>where he had paſſed the pleaſanteſt
          <lb/>hours of his life. Every thing ſeemed
          <lb/>juſt as it had been left about the
          <lb/>park. With a heart almoſt throbbing
          <lb/>through his boſom, he approached the
          <lb/>houſe, and wondered to ſee no ſervants
          <lb/>round it; nor the dogs, who were uſually
          <lb/>running out on the approach of ſtrangers.
          <lb/>All was mournfully ſilent; and moſt of the
          <lb/>windows were ſhut. Certain of not being
          <lb/>known, if he was unable to reſiſt the
          <lb/>temptation he felt, to try the door of the
          <lb/>lower turret――It was locked, and he pro­
          <lb/>ceeded round the houſe to the ſtable-yard.
          <lb/>There was no perſon to be ſeen where
          <lb/>formerly there had been four or five
          <lb/>ſervants: there was no appearance of
          <lb/>horſes; no poultry pecking about; all
          <lb/>was ſtill as death, and the graſs had grown
          <lb/>up among the pavement. <persName>Orlando's</persName> heart
          <lb/>ſunk within him; yet he knew not what
          <lb/>to fear! the approach of the evening lent
          <lb/>new gloom to the deſolate appearance of
          <lb/>all that he beheld.</p>

          <lb/>indulge the mournful propenſity he had
          <lb/>to traverſe theſe dreary rooms, and to viſit

          <lb/>in happier days; he found it broken, and
          <lb/>off the hinges:――he entered the chapel,

          <lb/>which opened into the park, and which

          <lb/>it was faſtened; but it was yet light enough
          <lb/>for him to diſtinguiſh that the key was
          <lb/>in it, within. He broke a pane of the glaſs
          <lb/>without heſitation, and, putting his hand
          <lb/>through, unlocked the door, and entered
          <lb/>this parlour.</p>
            <p>Melancholy were the obſervations he
          <lb/>made, as, by the little light he had, he
          <lb/>traverſed this room. The wainſcot had
          <lb/>fallen down, and the boards were rotted
          <lb/>away: the ſtudy, of which the door was
          <lb/>open, had only half its books left; and the
          <lb/>tapeſtry hung in fragments from the walls.
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> could not bear the cold chill that
          <lb/>ſtruck on his heart. A low, hollow guſt of
          <lb/>wind ruſhed through the deſerted rooms:
          <lb/>it ſeemed loaded with the groans of all he
          <lb/>had ever loved, or revered――Yet he pro­
          <lb/>ceeded along the paſſage, which was quite
          <lb/>dark――and, hardly knowing to what pur­
          <lb/>poſe, went through the great hall, and
          <lb/>up the principal ſtair-caſe――He entered the
          <lb/>long north gallery, where, in the April days
          <lb/>of their juvenile affection, he had nearly

          <lb/>betrayed his innocent partiality for <persName>Mo­

          <lb/>the window.――Hideous ſpectres ſeemed to
          <lb/>beckon to him from the other end of it,
          <lb/>and to menace him from the walls; though
          <lb/>he knew that they were the portraits of
          <lb/>his family in their black doublets, their
          <lb/>armour, or their flowing night-gowns:――he
          <lb/>ſtopped, however, in terror he was aſhamed
          <lb/>of feeling, and, liſtening a moment, thought
          <lb/>he heard a door ſhut in ſome diſtant part
          <lb/>of the houſe――Were there then inhabitants?
          <lb/>or was it only the wind which flung-to one
          <lb/>of the doors he had left open?――He liſten­
          <lb/>ed again; but all was ſtill, and he began
          <lb/>to conſider what he ſhould do next.――Fa­
          <lb/>tigued and worn out as he was, and almoſt
          <lb/>incapable of going farther, he felt a mo­
          <lb/>mentary inclination to take poſſeſſion of a
          <lb/>bed. He opened the door of one of the
          <lb/>beſt chambers: the old high-teſtered green
          <lb/>ſilk bed looked like a mauſoleum――it ſeem­
          <lb/>ed black, and <persName>Orlando</persName> could have fancied

          <lb/>an immediate conviction, by the ſize of
          <lb/>every utenſil, of old Engliſh hoſpitality. It
          <lb/>was ſuch as <persName>Pope</persName> deſcribes in his letter to

          <lb/>The door was not ſhut cloſe; he puſhed it

          <lb/>and mumble to herſelf, of which <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>could diſtinguiſh no more than, <said>Why a

            <p>The woman, who perceived him by the

          <lb/>lying on the ground, and apparently inſen­

            <p>His wife obeyed――and, taking a ſervant
          <lb/>man with her, who had lived many years
          <lb/>at the mill, they opened the door.――<persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName> was inſenſible, and the man pro­
          <lb/>nounced him dead;――but had not half a
          <lb/>ſecond held the candle to his face, before
          <lb/>he exclaimed with a great oath, that it
          <lb/>was either <persName>Orlando Somerive</persName>, or his ghoſt!
          <lb/>That it was not his ghoſt, but himſelf,
          <lb/>though ſadly changed both in countenance
          <lb/>and appearance, the miller's man was con­
          <lb/>vinced, when <persName>Orlando</persName>, awakened from his
          <lb/>trance by being moved, opened his eyes,
          <lb/>while with a deep ſigh, and wildly ſtaring
          <lb/>about him, he wrung the man's hand, and

          <lb/>ing him into the houſe, put him into a
          <lb/>chair, and made him ſwallow ſome coarſe
          <lb/>kind of ſpirits――<persName>Orlando</persName> ſubmitting to
          <lb/>receive his aſſiſtance, but ſtill paſſionately
          <lb/>imploring him to ſay if what he fancied he
          <lb/>had heard was read, while the man with tears
          <lb/>in his eyes continued ſilent. By this time,
          <lb/>however, the miller himſelf, <persName>Mr. Whitly</persName>,
          <lb/>having been aſſured by his wife of <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando's</persName> identity, came down; and <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>renewing to him his eager adjurations, he
          <lb/>began a long conſolatory diſcourſe, in
          <lb/>which he attempted to prove that, as every
          <lb/>body muſt die, none ſhould be immeaſurably
          <lb/>grieved when an event ſo common hap­
          <lb/>pened to their friends.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> with glazed eyes and contracted

          <lb/>but, in fact, heard not a word of it beyond
          <lb/>thoſe that confirmed his misfortune. With
          <lb/>wildneſs in his voice and manner, he now
          <lb/>deſired to go to the houſe that was his
          <lb/>father's, to go to the pariſh-church where
          <lb/>he was buried. He demanded eagerly

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">46</mw>
          <lb/>where his mother was? where were his
          <lb/>ſiſters? His hoſt anſwered, that they had
          <lb/>been gone a long time to <placeName>London</placeName>; and
          <lb/>that as to talking of going to <name>Weſt Wol­

          <lb/>to think of going into the church at ſuch
          <lb/>a time, why it was quite out of reaſon;
          <lb/>but he adviſed him to go to bed where he
          <lb/>was for that night, ſaying very coldly
          <lb/>(which coldneſs <persName>Orlando</persName> did not however
          <lb/>remark), that he was welcome to a ſpare
          <lb/>bed they had for one night or ſo; and the
          <lb/>old ſervant plying him with ſpirits as libe­
          <lb/>rally as his maſter did with advice, and
          <lb/>believing his remedy the moſt efficacious
          <lb/>of the two, fatigue and weakneſs ſoon
          <lb/>overcome by the power of this application,
          <lb/>he ſuffered himſelf, almoſt in a ſtate of in­

          <lb/>a bed, on which, without taking off his
          <lb/>clothes, he threw himſelf, and forgot for a
          <lb/>little while all his ſorrows.</p>
            <p>Alas! they recurred in the morning

          <lb/>him; but too ſoon the ſad remembrance
          <lb/>of his irreparable calamities ruſhed upon
          <lb/>him, and he had need of all his reaſon and
          <lb/>all his fortitude to enable him to bear this
          <lb/>terrible conviction like a man. He went
          <lb/>down ſtairs, determined to viſit <placeName>Weſt Wol­
          <lb/>verton</placeName> and the church, and then to ſet out
          <lb/>for <placeName>London</placeName>; but he had only <measure>eighteen-
            <lb/>pence</measure> in his pocket, the remainder of what
          <lb/>the ſailors had lent him at <placeName>Shoreham</placeName>, and
          <lb/>his clothes were ſuch as would prevent him
          <lb/>from obtaining credit on the road. He
          <lb/>hoped that at the neighbouring town he
          <lb/>might, when he was known, obtain credit
          <lb/>for ſuch an equipment as would prevent
          <lb/>his terrifying his family by his appearance;
          <lb/>and, perhaps, a ſmall ſupply of money
          <lb/>from <persName>Mr. Whitly</persName>, to whom, as ſoon as
          <lb/>he ſaw him, he opened without reſitation
          <lb/>the reduced ſtate of his finances, and
          <lb/>deſired he would lend him a guinea or two
          <lb/>to bear his expences to <placeName>London</placeName>. This

          <lb/>hardly knowing what he did, he went

          <lb/>but it was only momentary, for grief of a

          <lb/>and when he arrived at the door of the

          <lb/>conſidering that the houſe was now in poſ­

          <lb/>miſtreſs, and, carefully locking the kit­
          <lb/>chen door, informed her that there was
          <lb/>a crazy man in the yard. This young
          <lb/>woman, who was the miſtreſs of one of
          <lb/><persName>Stockton's</persName> friends to whom he had lent the
          <lb/>houſe, wanted neither underſtanding nor

          <lb/>propenſity of the vilgar to terrify them­
          <lb/>ſelves and others, ſhe called to a man, who
          <lb/>was at work in the garden, to follow her,
          <lb/>and then went to ſpeak herſelf to the per­
          <lb/>ſon whom her ſervant had repreſented as

            <p>She found the unhappy young man ſeated

            <p>The ſervant being ſent away, <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>ſet forth to viſit the tomb of his father.――
          <lb/>He knew well the ſpot:――it was in the
          <lb/>chancel of the church, ahd the entrance
          <lb/>was marked by a ſtone, with the arms of
          <lb/><persName>Somerive</persName> and <persName>Rayland</persName>
          quartered upon it.
          <lb/>The ſexton, who at firſt appeared to have
          <lb/>loſt all recollection of him, gave him the
          <lb/>keys as ſoon as he knew him――and the un­
          <lb/>happy wanderer, throwing himſelf on the
          <lb/>ground, gave way to that grief which he
          <lb/>had hitherto checked.――Now it was, how­
          <lb/>ever, that he felt the reward of his dutiful
          <lb/>conduct; for he was conſcious that, except
          <lb/>in the ſingle inſtance in regard to his ſiſter
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName>, he had never wilfully diſobeyed

          <lb/>he too well underſtood had haſtened the
          <lb/>death of his parent, that ſorrow, which was
          <lb/>now unmixed with ſelf-reproach, would
          <lb/>then have driven him to diſtraction.――As
          <lb/>he kiſſed and took a laſt leave of this de­
          <lb/>poſit of the aſhes of his family, he recol­
          <lb/>lected, that his affection to the loſt friend
          <lb/>whom he deplored would be ſhewn rather
          <lb/>by his tenderneſs and duty towards his
          <lb/>mothers and ſiſters, than by giving himſelf
          <lb/>up to uſeleſs deſpair.――Rouſed by this re­
          <lb/>flection to more manly thoughts, he aroſe
          <lb/>from the ground, and his heart having
          <lb/>been relieved by the indulgence he had
          <lb/>thus given to his grief, he quitted the
          <lb/>church with a deep ſigh, and determined
          <lb/>to walk as quickly as he could round <placeName>Ray­

          <lb/>deſire to viſit the turret of <persName>Monimia</persName>,
          <lb/>which he thought he might do in the day
          <lb/>time, by letting himſelf in through the
          <lb/>ſame door where he had entered before;
          <lb/>and, as he knew every part of the houſe,

          <lb/>the houſe. In this intention he traverſed

          <lb/>when the ſight of the north lodge and the
          <lb/>cottage near it, brought to his mind the
          <lb/>circumſtances of <persName>Monimia's</persName> letter; who
          <lb/>there deſcribed her meeting with <persName>Sir John
            <lb/>Belgrave</persName>. And he thought the woman of
          <lb/>the cottage might give him ſome particu­
          <lb/>lars, which he hitherto had not been able
          <lb/>to learn.――Entering therefore, and making
          <lb/>her, not without much difficulty, recollect
          <lb/>him; he was forced to bear all her won­
          <lb/>dering, and all her enquiries, before he
          <lb/>could prevail upon her to give him the
          <lb/>following particulars:</p>

            <lb/>law; but old <persName>Roker</persName> and his nephew would
            <lb/>not let him or his people come in; as
            <lb/>they ſaid they had a will of <persName>Madam Ray­
              <lb/>land's</persName>, and he muſt come and hear it read.
            <lb/>――Your mother tried, as I heard ſay, to pa­
            <lb/>cify your brother; becauſe ſhe knew, or
            <lb/>however believed for certain, that your
            <lb/>honour's ſelf was the heir――So with that,
            <lb/>upon a day appointed by theſe <name>Rokers</name>,
            <lb/>who had poſſeſſion of the houſe, your
            <lb/>poor mother, and your two ſiſters, and
            <lb/>the young 'ſquire your brother, they
            <lb/>went to the Hall, and there, as I heard
            <lb/>ſay, was the two <name>Rokers</name> and <persName>Madam
              <lb/>Lennard</persName>, and the ſervants, all aſſembled;
            <lb/>and ſo young <persName>Roker</persName> took upon him to
            <lb/>read the will, though your brother took a
            <lb/>young lawyer with him from <placeName>London</placeName>,

            <lb/>one <persName>Counſellor Staply</persName>; and there the will
            <lb/>was read; and inſtead of leaving you the
            <lb/>heir, it was a will made ever ſo long before,
            <lb/>when <persName>Madam Rayland</persName> was out of hu­

            <lb/>it ſeems, that ſhe gave <measure>five thouſand
            pounds</measure>
            <lb/>to <persName>Pattenſon</persName> if he outlived her, but he was
            <lb/>dead, and there was an end of that; and
            <lb/><measure>two thouſand</measure> to the old coachman, who is
            <lb/>as rich as a <name>Jew</name> already――and a matter of
            <lb/><measure>ten thouſand</measure> to
            <persName>Mrs. Lennard</persName>――And not
            <lb/>only ſo, but all her clothes――and ever ſo
            <lb/>many pieces of fine place; and a diamond
            <lb/>ring――and the <placeName>Hampſhire</placeName> farms, which
            <lb/>ben't worth ſo little as <measure>four hundred pounds</measure>
            <lb/>a year――And then, all Madam's fine laces,
            <lb/>and ſattin gowns, and her ſiſter's too, for
            <lb/>none of them had ever been given away――
            <lb/>They ſay that 'twas not ſo little as <measure>ſix or
              <lb/>ſeven hundred pounds</measure> worth of clothes
            <lb/>and laces; and all the fine houſehold li­
            <lb/>nen――Such beautiful greak damaſk table­
            <lb/>cloths and napkins――And ſuch great cheſts

            <lb/>county, ſhe gave to the Biſhop, as I ſup­
            <lb/>poſe you know, and to the Dean and
            <lb/>Chapter, for charitable uſes, and to build
            <lb/>a ſort of alms-houſe――But it's very well
            <lb/>known that the greateſt part of it will go
            <lb/>into their own pockets――and I cannot
            <lb/>think, for my ſhare, and my huſband he
            <lb/>ſays the ſame, why a-deuce Madam gave
            <lb/>her money to them there parſons, when

            <p>To undeceive them as ſoon as he could
          <lb/>was what appeared moſt neceſſary; but
          <lb/>how to do that he knew not. He could

          <lb/>of them but <persName>Stockton</persName> (who was the laſt
          <lb/>man in the world he deſired to meet), for
          <lb/>all the reſt were at a great diſtance, and
          <lb/>the elder <name>Somerive</name> had never ſought their
          <lb/>acquaintance: ſome were too expenſive
          <lb/>for him, and others too ignorant to afford
          <lb/>him any pleaſure in their ſociety. By the

          <lb/>the young man thought he recollected his 
          <lb/>hand, there having been formerly ſome

          <lb/>unwilling to diſpute the point with <persName>Brock</persName>,
          <lb/>who was, he told him, Solicitor in the de­

            <p>With a thouſand grateful acknowledg­

        variety of uneaſy emotions which
          <lb/>paſſed through the mind of <persName>Orlando</persName>,
          <lb/>as he journeyed towards <placeName>London</placeName>, would
          <lb/>be difficult to deſcribe, ſince he himſelf
          <lb/>could hardly diſcirminate them; but each,
          <lb/>though not diſtinct, was acutely painful.
          <lb/>In what a ſituation did he return to his
          <lb/>family! in what a ſituation did he find it!
          <lb/>How ſhould he, while his mind was yet

          <lb/>he had experienced on his arrival in <placeName>En­

          <lb/>ſuſtained? how ſtrengthen by his example
          <lb/>their more tender minds, to endure what
          <lb/>he feared the diſſolute folly of his brother

<pb n="4081"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">81</mw>
          <lb/>might yet bring upon them; while his own
          <lb/>heart recoiled from the idea of meeting
          <lb/>that brother, and was bleeding with the
          <lb/>dreadful wounds inflincted by the uncer­
          <lb/>tainty of what was become of <persName>Monimia</persName>;
          <lb/>which, had he not entertained ſome hopes
          <lb/>of hearing of her from his ſiſter <persName>Selina</persName>,
          <lb/>would have driven him to diſtraction! Of
          <lb/>his ſiſter <persName>Iſabella</persName> he thought too with
          <lb/>great concern; and when the reflection,
          <lb/>which alone brought ſome comfort to his
          <lb/>mind, occurred to him, that he had reſiſted
          <lb/>the temptation <persName>Warwick</persName> threw in his way,
          <lb/>and had not, to gratify himſelf, plunged
          <lb/>another dagger in the heart of his father――
          <lb/>even this conſolatory teſtimony of his con­
          <lb/>ſcience was embittered by the enquiry that
          <lb/>conſcience immediately made, whether he
          <lb/>had not acted wrong in not diſcovering the
          <lb/>deſign of <persName>Warwick</persName>, and had not ſacrificed
          <lb/>his real duty to a miſtaken point of honour.
          <lb/>As he approached <placeName>London</placeName>, the agitation
          <lb/>of his mind became greater. As his mother
          <lb/>believed him dead, his ſudden appearance

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">82</mw>
          <lb/>might have the moſt fatal effects――That
          <lb/>even if he was put down at a coffee houſe,
          <lb/>and ſent a note to inform her of his arrival,
          <lb/>the ſight of his hand-writing might equally
          <lb/>affect a mother and ſiſters, who had long
          <lb/>lamented him as conſigned to a grave on
          <lb/>the banks of <name>Hudſon's River</name>.</p>
            <p>There was one expedient that occurred,
          <lb/>which, though extremely diſagreeable to
          <lb/>him, he at length determined to adopt――
          <lb/>which was, to go on his reaching <placeName>London</placeName>
          <lb/>to <persName>Mr. Woodford's</persName>, and conſult with him
          <lb/>on the propereſt way of diſcovering to his
          <lb/>family his unexpected arrival.</p>
            <p>Though he was aware that he ſhould
          <lb/>have only inſulting pity or coarſe raillery
          <lb/>to ſuſtain from his uncle, he thought the
          <lb/>dread of ſuch tranſient and inconſequen­
          <lb/>tial evils, ſhould yield to the important
          <lb/>point of not injuring the health of a parent
          <lb/>ſo beloved; and as ſoon as the ſtage in
          <lb/>which he travelled reached <name>Weſtminiſter
          <lb/>Bridge</name>, he got into an hackney-coach, and

          <lb/>ordered it to be driven to the houſe of
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>.</p>
            <p>On his reaching this place, and enquir­
          <lb/>ing for him, he was told by a maid that
          <lb/>opened the door, that <persName>Mr. Woodford's</persName>
          <lb/>family had been removes ſome months
          <lb/>from that houſe, and reſided in <placeName>King's
            <lb/>Street, St. James's Square</placeName>, at an houſe of
          <lb/>which the maid gave him the number, and
          <lb/>whither he immediately repaired.</p>
            <p>It was eaſily found――two lamps at the
          <lb/>door, and the appearance of the houſe,
          <lb/>which had been lately refitted in a ſtyle
          <lb/>of uncommon elegance, ſeemed to ſay to
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, that he would find his uncle in
          <lb/>increaſing affluence.</p>
            <p>A very ſmart powdered footman opened
          <lb/>the door, who, upon being aſked if <persName>Mr.
          <lb/>Woodford</persName> was at home, anſwered ſhortly,
          <lb/>No; and ſurverying the hackney coach
          <lb/>with contempt, ſeemed diſpoſed to cloſe
          <lb/>the half-opened door, without attending to

            <p>But <persName>Orlando</persName>, putting his head out of the
          <lb/>coach, called to the ſervant, and enquired
          <lb/>at what time that evening he could ſee
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>, with whom he had buſi­

            <lb/>will do no buſineſs with any body to-night;

            <lb/>ſure he won't be diſturbed.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> now got out of the coach, and
          <lb/>ſaid to the ſervant, that as he was <persName>Mr.

          <lb/>apparent reluctance, opened the door of

          <lb/>himſelf, as if he was afraid <persName>Orlando</persName> would
          <lb/>ſteal ſomething, called to another footman

          <lb/>become ſo, by means which <persName>Orlando</persName> won­

          <lb/>opportunity of opening the ſtreet door him­
          <lb/>ſelf, and returned to his back, which was
          <lb/>driven into the ſquare, to make room for
          <lb/>the ſplendid equipages which had ſince
          <lb/>arrived at the door.</p>
            <p>He ſtepped in; but when the coachman
          <lb/>aſked him whither to drive, he knew not
          <lb/>what to reply. He knew nobody: nor

          <lb/>town, to whom he coul din ſuch an exi­
          <lb/>gence apply.――The ſmall houſe his mother
          <lb/>had taken, was in <placeName>Howland-Street</placeName>; and
          <lb/>he thought he had better drive to ſome
          <lb/>coffee-houſe in the neighbourhood, where
          <lb/>he might conſider how he could firſt ſpeak

          <lb/>one, he could not help reflecting on the
          <lb/>ſtrange viciſſitudes of fortune, and the
          <lb/>ſtrange way in which her gifts are divided.
          <lb/>It was only a few months ſince he had an
          <lb/>almoſt undoubted proſpect of ſucceeding
          <lb/>to the great eſtates of <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>; he
          <lb/>was now not only deprived of all thoſe
          <lb/>hopes, but was literally a beggar――and
          <lb/>going home, not to aſſiſt his ruined family,
          <lb/>but to add to it another indigent member,
          <lb/>and to weep with them all the mournful
          <lb/>changes that had happened during his ab­

          <lb/>houſe, where he diſcharged his coach, and
          <lb/>called for a private room. He then, ſince
          <lb/>no better expedient occurred to him, de­
          <lb/>ſired a pen, ink, and paper, and in an hand
          <lb/>which he attempted to diſguiſe (and he
          <lb/>trembled ſo as to aid the deception) he wrote
          <lb/>theſe few words to Selina――<quote source="b:INTERNAL" rend="pre(“)post(”)">Your brother

            <p>This ſcheme appeared to him ſo much

          <lb/>At length he gave a loud ſingle rap, and

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> entreated of him to go up, to

          <lb/>which had alarmed and diſtreſſed his mother,

            <p>Two things, however, were immediately

          <lb/>be done, to put the money it would pro­

          <lb/>rangement was ſecondary to his ardent de­

          <lb/>He wrote as ſoon as he aroſe in the morning

          <lb/>his anxiety immediately ſuggeſted, he
          <lb/>joined his mother and ſiſters at breakfaſt
          <lb/>with ſome degree of apparent compoſure,
          <lb/>and gave them, as he found his mother
          <lb/>now better able to bear it, a ſketch of his
          <lb/>adventures upon the road; at which they
          <lb/>were ſo much affected, that he ſoon found
          <lb/>it neceſſary to drop the converſation; and
          <lb/>ſaying he ſhould walk out till dinner, he
          <lb/>took his way to a coffee-houſe much fre­
          <lb/>quented by military men, near <placeName>St. James's</placeName>,
          <lb/>where he hoped to hear ſomething of <persName>War­
            <lb/>wick</persName>, as well as to learn whether the General
          <lb/>(whom he dared not mention to his mother
          <lb/>leſt it ſhould occaſion enquiries about
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName> which he could not anſwer) had
          <lb/>conſoled himſelf with ſome other young
          <lb/>woman for his cruel mortification in regard
          <lb/>to <persName>Iſabella</persName>, and revenged himſelf by
          diſin­
          <lb/>heriting his nephew for the loſs of his in­
          <lb/>tended bride.</p>
            <p>He met ſeveral of his old acquaintance;

          <lb/>miſſion; but told him that he could not, he
          <lb/>thought, diſpoſe of it without applying to
          <lb/><persName>General Tracy</persName>, from whoſe hands he had
          <lb/>received it. This <persName>Orlando</persName> determined to
          <lb/>do; and as he was impatient to be at ſome
          <lb/>certainty, he went immediately to his houſe
          <lb/>in <placeName>Groſvenor-Place</placeName>.</p>
            <p>It happened that the General, who was
          <lb/>now almoſt always a martyr to the gout,
          <lb/>had given orders to be denied to every body
          <lb/>who might chance to call, except two per­
          <lb/>ſons whom he named, and for one of whom
          <lb/>the man who opened the door, and who
          <lb/>had only lately come into the houſe, miſ­
          <lb/>took <persName>Orlando</persName>,who was therefore uſhered
          <lb/>up ſtairs, where, in a magnificent room, the
          <lb/>General ſat in a great chair, ſupported by
          <lb/>pillows, and his limbs wrapped in flannel.
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> was much altered, and the General
          <lb/>was near-ſighted; ſo that he was obliged to
          <lb/>approach, and to announce himſelf. For­
          <lb/>getting for a moment his diſabled limbs,
          <lb/><persName>Tracy</persName> almoſt ſtarted out of his chair; but
          <lb/>then recollecting probably that a man of

          <lb/>faſhion ſhould never ſuffer himſelf to appear
          <lb/>diſcompoſed at any thing, he recovered
          <lb/>himſelf, and coldly deſired <persName>Orlando</persName> to ſit
          <lb/>down.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>,affected by ſeeing a man whom
          <lb/>he had laſt ſeen as a gueſt of his father,
          <lb/>gave, in a mild and low voice, into a little
          <lb/>hiſtory of his adventures; the parole he had
          <lb/>given, which precluded him from ſerving
          <lb/>during the preſent war; and his wiſh there­
          <lb/>fore to transfer his commiſſion to ſome one
          <lb/>who might not be under the ſame diſad­
          <lb/>vantages.</p>
            <p><persName>General Tracy</persName> heard him with repulſive
          <lb/>indifference, and then ſaid――<said>Well, Sir,
            <lb/>the commiſſion is yours, and you are per­
            <lb/>fectly at liberty to keep or to diſpoſe of
            <lb/>it.――I am very far from meaning to trouble
            <lb/>you with my advice; but as your expecta­
            <lb/>tions of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> fortune are all
          diſ­
            <lb/>appointed, I ſhould have ſuppoſed a pro­
            <lb/>feſſion might have been found uſeful to you.
            <lb/>However, Sir, you are the beſt judge.
            <lb/>The commiſſion is yours――I am ſorry I am

            <lb/>too much indiſpoſed to have the pleaſure
            <lb/>of your company longer, and I wiſh you
            <lb/>a good day.</said> He then rang, and his valet
          <lb/>appearing, he bade him open the door.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, thus diſmiſſed, retired in an­
          <lb/>ger, which he had no means of venting;
          <lb/>and went back to the coffee-houſe, where
          <lb/>his friend waited for him, to whom he for­
          <lb/>bore, however to ſpeak of <persName>Tracy's</persName> beha­
          <lb/>viour; becauſe he could not but feel that
          <lb/>if he believed him, as he probably did,
          <lb/>concerned in the elopement of <persName>Iſabella</persName> with
          <lb/><persName>Warwick</persName>, he had ſome grounds for his re­
          <lb/>ſentment――a reſentment which, when <persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName> reflected on his humiliation, and his
          <lb/>being now tormented by bodily infirmi­
          <lb/>ties, he was too generous not to forgive.
          <lb/>His friend, a lieutenant in the 51ſt, now
          <lb/>went with him to the office of an agent, to
          <lb/>treat about his commiſſion; and, as they
          <lb/>went, related to him, that it was believed
          <lb/>at the War-office, <persName>Warwick</persName> had periſhed at
          <lb/>ſea, as there never was an inſtance of a
          <lb/>man's being miſſing for ſo many months;

          <lb/>and that, had he been taken priſoner by an
          <lb/>American or French privateer, and carried
          <lb/>to ſome of their places of rendezvous, he
          <lb/>would before now have written home, or
          <lb/>he would have been exchanged. This ap­
          <lb/>peared to be but too probably; but ſtill
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, in recollecting how he had been
          <lb/>ſituated himſelf, entertained a faint hope
          <lb/>that they might yet hear of his friend and
          <lb/>his ſiſter, though the dangers and difficul­
          <lb/>ties to which the latter might have been
          <lb/>expoſed made him tremble. Having put
          <lb/>his buſineſs in the proper train, he re­
          <lb/>turned home, meditating, as he went, on
          <lb/>all the ſtrange and diſagreeable occurrences
          <lb/>that had happened ſince he uſed to tra­
          <lb/>verſe theſe ſtreets with <persName>Warwick</persName>, who had
          <lb/>ldgins in <placeName>Bond-ſtreet</placeName>.――All the ſcenes
          he
          <lb/>had paſſed through aroſe in lively ſucceſ­
          <lb/>ſion in his mind, and that for the firſt time
          <lb/>ſince his landing in <placeName>England</placeName>; for the
          <lb/>ſhocks he received on his arrival at <name>Ray­
          <lb/>land Hall</name>, and by hearing of the death of
          <lb/>his father, had for a while abſorbed all

          <lb/>other recollections.――He now conſidered,
          <lb/>that when his commiſſion was diſpoſed of,
          <lb/>his whole fortune would be only <measure>between
          <lb/>three and four hundred pounds</measure>; yet, with
          <lb/>the ſanguine ſpirit of a youngman, which
          <lb/>his former ſevere diſappointments had not
          <lb/>checked, he believed that, with a ſum ſo
          <lb/>moderate, he could, by dint of perſe­
          <lb/>verance and induſtry, find ſome reputable
          <lb/>employment, by which he might not only
          <lb/>be enabled to aſſiſt his mother, but to keep
          <lb/>a wife, as he was reſolved, the moment he
          <lb/>could find <persName>Monimia</persName>, to marry her; and in
          <lb/>this only he thought he might be forgiven
          <lb/>for not conſulting his mother――to his duty
          <lb/>and affection towards whom he never
          <lb/>meant that any other attachment ſhould be
          <lb/>injurious.</p>
            <p>He had not yet had time to talk to <persName>Se­
            <lb/>lina</persName>, of the law-ſuit which he heard <persName>Philip</persName>
          <lb/>had inſtituted for the recovery of the <name>Ray­
          <lb/>land eſtate</name>; but he had in the evening an
          <lb/>opportunity of talking about it to <persName>Selina</persName>,
          <lb/>and heard that it now languiſhed, partly
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">for</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="G9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">137</mw>
          <lb/>for want of money, and partly through
          <lb/><persName>Philip's</persName> neglect, who had of late again diſ­
          <lb/>appeared, and therefore nothing was likely 
          <lb/>to be made of the ſuit.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> enquired againſt whom, and
          <lb/>on what grounds it was begun?――and
          <lb/>learned, though <persName>Selina</persName> did not very clearly
          <lb/>underſtand the terms, that it was againſt
          <lb/>the reverend body who claimed the eſtate,
          <lb/>one of whom (<persName>Doctor Hollybourn</persName>) had
          <lb/>adminiſtered as executor; becauſe the will
          <lb/>nominated to that office the dean of the
          <lb/>dioceſe for the time being, to which the
          <lb/>doctor had ſucceeded a few days only be­
          <lb/>fore <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> death; and that there
          <lb/>was not only a ſuit at common law, but in
          <lb/>chancery.</p>
            <p>As there was great reaſon to believe that
          <lb/>there was another will entirely in his fa­
          <lb/>vour, which had been either ſecreted or de­
          <lb/>troyed, <persName>Orlando</persName> determined to attempt
          <lb/>diſcovering this, and got a recommenda­
          <lb/>tion from his friend the lieutenant (for he
          <lb/>was too much diſguſted by the reception

          <lb/>he met with from <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName> to trou­
          <lb/>ble him again) to a young attorney, before
          <lb/>whom he laid the affair, and who gave him
          <lb/>great encouragement to purſue it.</p>
            <p>But the occupation in which this engaged
          <lb/>him, or in which he was engaged by the ſale
          <lb/>of his commuſſion, that was now within a
          <lb/>few days of being completed, could not for
          <lb/>a moment detach his mind from thoſe fears
          <lb/>which continually haunted him for <persName>Moni­
          <lb/>mia</persName>.――He waited with anxiety for the an­
          <lb/>ſwer he expected from <persName>Wincheſter</persName>, which
          <lb/>he hoped to have, as he had very earneſtly
          <lb/>preſſed for it, by the return of the poſt; but
          <lb/>that, and another, and another poſt ar­
          <lb/>rived without any letter; and he wrote
          <lb/>again, waited again three days, and was
          <lb/>again diſappointed of an anſwer.――He now
          <lb/>determined to go down himſelf, and find
          <lb/>out the woman from whom <persName>Selina</persName> had re­
          <lb/>ceived the information of <persName>Monimia's</persName> re­
          <lb/>moval; but, the day on which he had hired
          <lb/>an horſe, and was on the point of ſetting
          <lb/>out for that place, he was viſited by a man

          <lb/>of between fifty and ſixty, who ſent in his
          <lb/>name, in great form, as <persName>Mr. Roker</persName>.</p>
            <p>If a painter had occaſion to put upon

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> fetched his brother away in a
          <lb/>hackney-coach to a lodgin he had pro­
          <lb/>vided for him; where he ſupplied him
          <lb/>with preſent money, and where he hoped
          <lb/>he ſhould be able to ſupport him till ſome­
          <lb/>thing (though he knew not what) ſhould
          <lb/>happen to give a fortunate turn to the
          <lb/>affairs of their family.</p>
            <p><persName>Philip</persName> was penſive, ſilent, and, as
          <persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName> hoped, penitent. He had not as
          <lb/>yet ſpoken of him to his mother; and
          <lb/>though the circumſtances that would have
          <lb/>moſt ſenſibly afflicted her were now at an
          <lb/>end, <persName>Orlando</persName>, who ſaw his mothe rin that
          <lb/>ſtate of ſpirits which even the ſudden
          <lb/>opening of a door, or any unexpected
          <lb/>noiſe were ſufficient to overſet, dared not

          <lb/>yes aſk her to receive and to forgive a ſon,
          <lb/>who, though ſhe ſtill loved him, had given
          <lb/>her ſo much cauſe of complaint――as well
          <lb/>ſince, as before his father's death.</p>
            <p>The whole fortune of <persName>Orlando</persName> was now
          <lb/>reduced to about <measure>two hundred and fifty
            <lb/>pounds</measure>; for his commiſſion did not pro­
          <lb/>duce him quite dour. On this fortune,
          <lb/>however, he was ſtill bent on marrying
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, if he could find her; and of
          <lb/>truſting to Providence for the reſt.</p>
            <p>A few more mornings were ſtill paſſed
          <lb/>in fruitleſs reſearch. It was now the be­
          <lb/>ginning of January; and this beginning of
          <lb/>Term his bill was to be filed againſt the
          <lb/>perſons who were ſuppoſed to have any
          <lb/>knowledge of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> having made
          <lb/>another, and a ſubſequent will. It was in
          <lb/>ſearch of theſe people, of the ſervants who
          <lb/>had lived with her at the time of her death,
          <lb/>and of the lawyers who had made the will,
          <lb/>that he was now compelled for many days
          <lb/>longer to employ himſelf; every hour in­
          <lb/>creaſing the agony of mind with which he
<mw type="catch" rend="align(right)">thought</mw>
<pb n="4166"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">166</mw>
          <lb/>thought on the ſtate of <persName>Monimia</persName>, while all
          <lb/>the conſolation he had was in talking of
          <lb/>her to <persName>Selina</persName>, if he could at any time ſteal
          <lb/>an hour with her alone. On theſe occaſions
          <lb/>he wearied himſelf with conjecture as to
          <lb/>what was become of her; repeated the
          <lb/>ſame queſtions on which he had already
          <lb/>been often ſatisfied; and imagined new
          <lb/>means of tracing her, which when he
          <lb/>purſued, ſerved only to renew his diſap­
          <lb/>pointment and regre.</p>
            <p>At length――having learned that the
          <lb/>lawyer who made the will was dead, and
          <lb/>his clerk who had accompanied him to
          <lb/><name>Rayland Hall</name> ſettled at a town in <persName>Wilt­
            <lb/>ſhire</persName>――he reſolved, by the advice of
          <persName>Carr</persName>, to
          <lb/>go thither in ſearch of him, and then to
          <lb/>viſit the village near <name>Chriſtchurch</name>, where
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fleming</persName> and her family reſided. He
          <lb/>communicated this ſcheme to his mother,
          <lb/>who, while ſhe allowed the neceſſity of his
          <lb/>finding a perſon whoſe evidence might be
          <lb/>ſo material to him, could hardly pre­
          <lb/>vail upon herſelf to let him go for ten days

          <lb/>from her; for ſo long he imagined it
          <lb/>would be before he could return.</p>
            <p>At length he fixed the day with her ap­
          <lb/>probation, hired an horſe for the journey,
          <lb/>and took leave of his mother and his
          <lb/>ſiſters. He then viſited <persName>Philip</persName>, whom he
          <lb/>found in a very ſilent, and, as he thought,
          <lb/>ſomewhat ſullen mood. He gave him a 
          <lb/><measure>ten pound</measure> bank-note, as he complained of
          <lb/>being without money; and, in depreſſed
          <lb/>ſpirits, with hardly a glimpſe of hope to
          <lb/>cheer his melancholy way, he began his
          <lb/>journey.</p>
            <p>The weather was ſevere; but, on the
          <lb/>firſt night of his journey, a deep ſnow
          <lb/>threatened to render hiws progreſs more ſlow,
          <lb/>and compelled him to ſtay till a late hour
          <lb/>of the day, that the road might be beaten;
          <lb/>for all was now a pathleſs plain, and he
          <lb/>was a ſtranger to the road. About one
          <lb/>o'clock, however, he left the town where
          <lb/>he had paſſed the night, and went ſlowly
          <lb/>on. He was enured to the cold by his
          <lb/>abode in <placeName>America</placeName>; and in no haſte to get

          <lb/>to his inn, where nothing awaited him but
          <lb/>a ſolitary ſupper and mournful reflections.</p>
            <p>Again he ran over in his mind every poſ­
          <lb/>ſible circumſtance that could rob him of <persName>Mo­
          <lb/>nimia</persName>――and awakened in his breaſt all the
          <lb/>ſcorpions of diſtruſt, dread, and jealouſy;
          <lb/>for, whatever attempts he made to con­
          <lb/>quer ſo horrible an apprehenſion, it was to
          <lb/><persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>, and to the ſucceſs of
          <lb/>his cruel artifices, that his fears moſt fre­
          <lb/>quently pointed; and there were moments
          <lb/>in which he thought, that, were a per­
          <lb/>ſon before him who could tell him all he
          <lb/>ſo ſolicitouſly deſired to know, he ſhould
          <lb/>not have courage to aſk; for, ſhould he
          <lb/>hear that <persName>Monimia</persName> was loſt by the in­
          <lb/>famous ſeduction of ſuch a man, he be­
          <lb/>lieved he ſhould die on the ſpot, or loſe
          <lb/>his reaſon in the greatneſs of his ſorrow.</p>
            <p>It was between ten and eleven o'clock
          <lb/>in the evening of his ſecond day's journey,
          <lb/>that, in a wild and moory country, where ex­
          <lb/>tenſive heaths ſeemed to ſpread without end
          <lb/>before him, he began to think it time to ſeek

          <lb/>a lodging for the night. All around was
          <lb/>dreary and ſilent; and blank, he thought,
          <lb/>as his deſtiny. Yet he wiſhed the torpid
          <lb/>ſenſation that being long expoſed to the
          <lb/>cold had given to his limbs could reach
          <lb/>his heart, which was too acutely ſenſible!
          <lb/>In the midſt of the uniform waſte ſtood a
          <lb/>ſmall village, the ruſtic inhabitants of which
          <lb/>had long ſince retired to their hard beds;
          <lb/>and every thing was as quiet in their houſes
          <lb/>as it was around the little church that roſe
          <lb/>beyond them. <persName>Orlando</persName> would have en­
          <lb/>quired the diſtance to the next poſt-town,
          <lb/>but no human creature appeared――and he
          <lb/>paſſed on; his thoughts (as he compared
          <lb/>their peaceful ſlumbers with the ſtate of his
          <lb/>own troubled mind) aſſuming a poetical

          <lb/>the lawyer lived from whom he expected

          <lb/>to an inn, he ſent, at an early hour the fol­

          <lb/>who immediately came; and, inviting him

            <p>This gentleman, whoſe name was <persName>Wal­

          <lb/>thought was a tenant, or ſon to a tenant of

          <lb/>afterwards done with the will; relative to
          <lb/>which every thing was conducted with

          <lb/>engroſs ſome other writings about one of
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> farms; but that he never
          <lb/>copied the will, or knew more of its con­
          <lb/>tents than what paſſed in converſation af­
          <lb/>terwards between him and <persName>Mr. Lewes</persName>――
          <lb/>who, as they travelled together to <placeName>London</placeName>,
          <lb/>afterwards ſaid, in going through the park,

          <lb/>county of <placeName>Wilts</placeName>, was long, and rendered
          <lb/>particularly tedious by the viciſſitudes of
          <lb/>froſt and thaw that had prevailed for ſome
          <lb/>days――which had made the roads, where
          <lb/>the ſnow half diſſolved had been again ſud­
          <lb/>denly frozen, ſo dangerous, that he was often
          <lb/>under the neceſſity of leading his horſe for
          <lb/>many miles together. He propoſed, after
          <lb/>viſiting <persName>Mrs. Fleming</persName>, to croſs the country
          <lb/>to <name>Rayland Hall</name>; and, whatever pain it

          <lb/>called her, forgetting at that moment her
          <lb/>change of name; and that it could at leaſt
          <lb/>do no harm if he ſaw her, and endeavour
          <lb/>to find in her converſation, if not from her
          <lb/>candour, ſomething which might lend him

          <lb/>was not indeed very eminent either for

          <lb/>property, and a thriving man in the world,
          <lb/>and his neighbours were not therefore diſ­
          <lb/>poſed to trouble themſelved either with one
          <lb/>or the other. As he ſtill practiſed the law,
          <lb/>he was uſually in <placeName>London</placeName> in the winter;

          <lb/>bouring families; and ſome ſtories were in
          <lb/>circulation not much to the honour of his

          <lb/>domeſtic faults, he was every where received
          <lb/>and conſidered a reſpectable man, be­
          <lb/>cauſe he had every appearance of becoming
          <lb/>a rich one.</p>

            <p>If ſhe was confined by her huſband
          <lb/>under pretence of madneſs, as he thought
          <lb/>was very probably the caſe, in order to

          <lb/>had inſiſted on her continuaing to conceal,
          <lb/>ſhe would probably ſtill be deterred, by her
          <lb/>fears and her ſhame, from declaring the
          <lb/>truth; and if ſhe was indeed mad, his letter
          <lb/>to her would avail nothing, or perhaps be
          <lb/>prejudicial, by falling into the hands of her
          <lb/>keepers. There was alſo a third poſſibility,
          <lb/>which was, that ſhe might ſtill retain ſo

          <lb/>reſent the interference of any one who ſup­
          <lb/>poſed her ill uſed, even though they offered

          <lb/>However, as no other chance ſeemed to offer,
          <lb/>he determined to hazard this meaſure; and
          <lb/>wording his letter as cautiouſly as he could,

          <lb/>her the means of eſcaping, and entreated

          <lb/>all ſhe knew of <persName>Mrs. Rayland's</persName> affairs at
          <lb/>the time of her death; aſſuring her, in the
          <lb/>moſt ſolemn manner, that if ever he recover­
          <lb/>ed the eſtate, and by her means, he would
          <lb/>not only enter into any agreement ſhe
          <lb/>ſhould dictate to ſecure to her all ſhe now
          <lb/>poſſeſſed, but would, if ſhe had given all
          <lb/>up to her huſband, ſettle upon her for life
          <lb/>a ſum that ſhould make her more rich and
          <lb/>independent than ſhe had been before ſhe
          <lb/>gave herſelf to <persName>Mr. Roker</persName>; and that ſhe
          <lb/>ſhould inhabit her own apartments at the
          <lb/>Hall, or any houſe on the eſtate which ſhe
          <lb/>might chooſe. He ended with ſome pro­
          <lb/>feſſions of perſonal regard to her, as well
          <lb/>on account of their long acquaintance, as
          <lb/>becauſe ſhe was the relation, and had been
          <lb/>the benefactreſs of his beloved <persName>Monimia</persName>.</p>
            <p>This letter being finiſhed, he again ſet

          <lb/>cealed himſelf in the hovel which the ſer­

            <p>Thus, in meditations more moral

          <lb/>which he gathered around him, and lean­
          <lb/>ing againſt the boards of the barn, that he
          <lb/>might not fail to hear when the abaſſadreſs
          <lb/>entered the out-houſe adjoining to it. About
          <lb/>ten o'clock, as he gueſſed by the time he
          <lb/>had been there, he heard a ruſtling among
          <lb/>the wood and refuſe of the hovel; and
          <lb/>eagerly liſtening, in expectation of being
          <lb/>called by his female <persName>Mercury</persName>, he heard a
          <lb/>deep ſigh, or rather groan, and a voice
          <lb/>very unlike a female voice, lamenting in
          <lb/>very bitter and ſomewhat coarſe terms the

          <lb/>ther into the barn, he heard this unwelcome
          <lb/>gueſt make a noiſe which he knew was
          <lb/>ſtriking a light, and, putting a candle into
          <lb/>a lantern, which he ſeemed to have hid,
          <lb/>he ſet it down by him, and began to eat
          <lb/>his miſerable ſupper, conſiſting of ſcraps

          <lb/>pelled to obey this unwelcome injunction,

          <lb/>and engaging by renewed preſents the

          <lb/>emiſſaries, he remounted his horſe, and
          <lb/>took the road to <placeName>Wincheſter</placeName>. He now
          <lb/>fell again into melancholy reflections:
          <lb/>every hour added to his deſpair about
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, and without her, life was not
          <lb/>in his opinion worth having. From theſe
          <lb/>thoughts a natural tranſition led him to
          <lb/>conſider the wonderful tenacity with which
          <lb/>thoſe beings clung to life, whoſe exiſtence
          <lb/>ſeemed to him only a ſeries of the moſt
          <lb/>terrible ſufferings:――beings, who expoſed
          <lb/>to all the miſeries of pain, poverty, ſick­
          <lb/>neſs, and famine; to pain unrelieved, and
          <lb/>the feebleneſs of age unaſſiſted, yet ſtill

          <lb/>now hardened by the froſt, hardly allowed
          <lb/>a footing to his horſe, recollected the haunt­
          <lb/>ing parties in the ſnow, which had amuſed
          <lb/>him in <placeName>America</placeName>; but the ſcene on each
          <lb/>ſide of him was very different. The ſcanty

          <lb/>after the ſevereſt weather, which had buried

          <lb/>of their cruel ſeparation. In this diſpoſi­
          <lb/>tion, trying to accuſtom himſelf to reflect
          <lb/>on a circumſtance which now diſtracted
          <lb/>him, he made a ſort of determination, that
          <lb/>if all his endeavours to find <persName>Monimia</persName> were
          <lb/>baffled, as they had hitherto been, he would
          <lb/>remain only to ſee the termination of the
          <lb/>ſuit relative to the <name>Rayland eſtate</name>, in hopes
          <lb/>of leaving his mother, brother, and ſiſters,

          <lb/>to wander alone over <placeName>Europe</placeName> and
          <placeName>America</placeName>.
          <lb/>While he perſued theſe contemplations,
          <lb/>the way became almoſt impaſſable; for a
          <lb/>ſmall current of water filtering through the
          <lb/>rocky bank, had ſpread itſelf over the road,
          <lb/>and formed a ſheet of ice, on which his
          <lb/>horſe was every moment in danger of fall­

          <lb/>to turn the ſhoes.――He had before diſ

          <lb/>horſe up the leaſt ſteep part of the hollow,
          <lb/>and then, ſtill leading it by the bridle, he
          <lb/>followed the foot-parth which led along its
          <lb/>edge.</p>
            <p>The tufts of trees and thick underwood
          <lb/>now became more frequent; and though it
          <lb/>was a fine, clear evening, the winter ſun,
          <lb/>almoſt ſunk beneath the horizon, lent only
          <lb/>pale and cold rays among the intevening
          <lb/>wood.――<persName>Orlando</persName> ſuppoſing, that if he
          were
          <lb/>benighted, he ſhould no longer diſtinguiſh
          <lb/>the path, quickened his pace; and the path
          <lb/>he followed, diverged a little from the
          <lb/>horſe road, brought him to a place where
          <lb/>the inequalities of the ground, half ſhaded
          <lb/>with bruſh-wood, ſhewed, that beneath it
          <lb/>were concealed more conſiderable frag­
          <lb/>ments of ruins, than what appeared above
          <lb/>among the trees, from whence the maſſes
          <lb/>of ſtone were ſo mantled with ivy, they
          <lb/>could hardly be diſtinguiſhed. The path
          <lb/>which <persName>Orlando</persName> continued to purſue, wound
          <lb/>among them, and led under broken arches

          <lb/>tacks of time and of violence, towards an
          <lb/>old gateway, whoſe form was yet entire.</p>
            <p>Every thing was perfectly ſtilla round;
          <lb/>even the robin, ſolitary ſongſter of the
          <lb/>frozen woods, had ceaſed his faint veſpers
          <lb/>to the ſetting ſun, and hardly a breath of
          <lb/>air agitated the leafleſs branches. This
          <lb/>dead ſilence was interrupted by no ſound,
          <lb/>but the ſlow progreſs of his horſe, as the
          <lb/>hollow ground beneath his feet ſounded
          <lb/>as if he trod on vaults. There was in the
          <lb/>ſcene, and in this dull pauſe of nature, a
          <lb/>ſolemnity not unpleaſing to <persName>Orlando</persName>, in his
          <lb/>preſent diſpoſition of mind.――Certain that
          <lb/>the path he was purſuing muſt lead to ſome
          <lb/>village or farm-houſe, and little apprehen­
          <lb/>ſive of the inconvenience that could in this
          <lb/>country befall a man accuſtomed to tra­
          <lb/>verſe the deſerts of <placeName>America</placeName>, he ſtopped
          a
          <lb/>moment or two, indulging a mournful re­
          <lb/>verie, before he began to remove, in or­
          <lb/>der to make a paſſage for his horſe, a kind
          <lb/>of bar, or rather broken gate, which, with

          <lb/>thorns, and a faggot or two piled under it,
          <lb/>paſſed from one ſide to the other of the
          <lb/>broken arch, and made here with an hedge,
          <lb/>that was carried among the ruins, a diviſion
          <lb/>of the foreſt, or perhaps one of its boun­
          <lb/>daries.</p>
            <p>As he meditated here, he heard, not far
          <lb/>from him, human voices, which ſeemed to
          <lb/>be thoſe of children; and, leaning over the
          <lb/>bar, to ſee if he could diſcern the perſons
          <lb/>who ſpoke, he obſerved a female figure
          <lb/>ſeated on a maſs of fallen ſtone, and appa­
          <lb/>rently waiting for two girls, one about nine,
          <lb/>the other ſeven years old, who were prat­
          <lb/>tling together, as they peeped about in
          <lb/>ſearch of ſomething among the fern-ſtacks
          <lb/>and low tufts of broom that were near.
          <lb/>The woman, whoſe face was turned towards
          <lb/>them ſeemed loſt in thought――Her ſtraw
          <lb/>bonnet was tied down cloſe to her face, and
          <lb/>ſhe was wrapped in a long black cloak; a
          <lb/>little baſket ſtood by her, and her appear­
          <lb/>and, as well as that of the children, was
          <lb/>ſuch as ſeemed to denote, that though

            <p>The voice rivited <persName>Orlando</persName> to the ſpot for

          <lb/>forward, and ſaw――<persName>Monimia</persName>!</p>
            <p>He repeated her name wildly, as if he
          <lb/>doubted whether he poſſeſſed his ſenſes;
          <lb/>and as he claſped her to his boſom, and
          <lb/>found it was indee dhis own <persName>Monimia</persName>, ſhe

          <lb/>frightened, and then amazed at the ſcene――
          <lb/>That <persName>Monimia</persName>, or, as they called her,
          <persName>Miſs
            <lb/>Moryſine</persName>, was now, and had been for ſome

          <lb/>ble retirement, a cottage among the woods,
          <lb/>fitted up and enlarged with two additional

            <lb/>troubleſome and impertinent intruſion of
            <lb/><persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>; and
            <persName>Selina</persName> has told
            <lb/>you ſince, that, as he carried his perſecu­
            <lb/>tions ſo far as to come into the houſe, and
            <lb/>endeavour to force his way into my room,
            <lb/>I was under the neceſſity of telling my
            <lb/>aunt how he found admittance, and of be­
            <lb/>traying a ſecret I had ſo many reaſons to
            <lb/>wiſh might never have been diſcovered.――
            <lb/>Alas! <persName>Orlando</persName>, how much did I not ſuffer

            <lb/>from the bitterneſs of her reproaches! ſuf­
            <lb/>ferings which were ſharpened by my being
            <lb/>compelled to acknowledge, that I had in
            <lb/>ſome meaſure deſerved them, by having
            <lb/>carried on a correſpondence contrary to
            <lb/>what I knew was my duty.――Indeed the
            <lb/>puniſhment I now underwent, from day to
            <lb/>day, ſeemed ſometimes much heavier than
            <lb/>the crime deſerved; eſpecially when my
            <lb/>aunt, to whom my moving was inconveni­
            <lb/>ent (though certainly in that great houſe,
            <lb/>there was room enough for me, without in­
            <lb/>terfering with her), began to make the diſ­
            <lb/>covery, I had thus been compelled to make,
            <lb/>an everlaſting theme of reproach to me;
            <lb/>to ſay, that ſuch a cunning, intriguing
            <lb/>creature was not fit to be in any houſe;
            <lb/>and to threaten me continually to ruin you,
            <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, with
            <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName>, by blowing
            <lb/>us up, as ſhe was pleaſed to term it. All
            <lb/>this I bore, however hard it was to bear,
            <lb/>with ſilence, and, I hope, with patience,
            <lb/>flattering myſelf, my dear friend! that the
            <lb/>anger we had perhaps mutually deſerved

            <lb/>would thus be exhauſted on me, and that
            <lb/>I alone ſhould be the victim, if a victim
            <lb/>were required: yet, when my cruel aunt,
            <lb/>unmoved by my reſignation and ſubmiſſion,
            <lb/>ſeemed ſo deſirous of getting rid of me,
            <lb/>that I believe ſhe would have been glad to
            <lb/>have ſold me to <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>; and
            <lb/>when ſhe inſiſted upon my conſenting to
            <lb/>marry him, though I do not believe he ever
            <lb/>intended it, and only made that a pretence
            <lb/>for getting me into his power; I own
            <lb/>there were moments, when, in abſolute
            <lb/>deſpair, I thought it would hardly have
            <lb/>been criminal to have put an end to a life
            <lb/>ſo very inſupportable; nor could I, I think,
            <lb/>have lived, if ſome of thoſe books you
            <lb/>taught me to read, and to underſtand, had
            <lb/>not inſtructed me, that it was impious to
            <lb/>murmur, or reſiſt the diſpenſations of Pro­
            <lb/>vidence, who knew beſt what we were able
            <lb/>to bear.――Perhaps too, the hope, the dear
            <lb/>hope of living in your affection, and of be­
            <lb/>ing beloved by you, however hard my lot,
            <lb/>lent me a portion of fortitude, for which,

            <lb/>ſurely, nobody ever had more occaſion:
            <lb/>for in proportion, <persName>Orlando</persName>, as
            <persName>Mrs. Len­
              <lb/>nard</persName> became attached to that odious
            <persName>Roker</persName>,
            <lb/>the little affection ſhe had ever ſhewn me
            <lb/>declined, and was changed into diſlike and
            <lb/>hatred.――She was ſometimes ſo much off
            <lb/>her guard, as to ſuffer her exceſſive and
            <lb/>rediculous attachment to him to diminiſh
            <lb/>her attention to her miſtreſs, and, on theſe
            <lb/>occaſions, I uſed to ſupply her place;――
            <lb/>yet then, if <persName>Mrs. Rayland</persName> ſeemed pleaſed
            <lb/>with my attendance, ſhe would quarrel with
            <lb/>me for attending, and ſay, that ſhe ſup­
            <lb/>poſed the next thing ſuch an artful ſlut
            <lb/>would think of, would be to ſupplant her
            <lb/>with her lady; and then again ſhe would
            <lb/>threaten to blow you up.――Indeed, I be­
            <lb/>lieve, that no ſituation could be leſs envia­
            <lb/>ble, than that of my poor aunt was at this
            <lb/>time; for though certainly, at her age, one
            <lb/>would have thought ſhe might have been
            <lb/>exempt from ſuffering much pain from
            <lb/>love, ſhe did really appear ſo tormented by
            <lb/>her exceſſive paſſion for <persName>Roker</persName>, and

            <lb/>fears of loſing him, that ſhe was an object
            <lb/>of pity.――If I was below with her lady,
            <lb/>while ſhe was with him, then ſhe was afraid
            <lb/>of my getting into favour with <persName>Mrs. Ray­
              <lb/>land</persName>; and if I was above, and he was in the
            <lb/>houſe, ſhe was in terror leſt ſo intriguing
            <lb/>a creature ſhould carry off her lover.
            <lb/>When I ſo firmly reſiſted all the inſidious
            <lb/>offers of <persName>Sir John Belgrave</persName>, ſhe doubted
            <lb/>whether this delectable <persName>Mr. Roker</persName> was not
            <lb/>the cauſe of it; and even when he hap­
            <lb/>pened to come into the room where I was,
            <lb/>though ſhe was preſent, ſhe turned pale
            <lb/>with jealouſy, and, I ſuppoſe, tormented
            <lb/>the man, who, that he bore it all with an
            <lb/>apparent increaſe of affection; and pre­
            <lb/>tending, in his turn, to be jealous, ſaid,

            <lb/>or that we might meet, and then ſhe was,
            <lb/>I really believe, out of her ſenſes. Very
            <lb/>unluckily for me, I came in one evening
            <lb/>later than uſual, breathleſs with my fooliſh

            <lb/>her to be in at tea-time, and he was not

            <lb/>where I had been; and I ſaid in the mill

            <lb/>moment, ſhe threw herſelf into a fit, as

              <lb/>him by the collar, with a ſudden jerk threw

              <lb/>The noiſe of all this made brought <persName>Mrs. New­

              <lb/>what was the matter? He anſwered, that ſome

              <lb/>His mother, in additional conſternation, then

          <lb/>as ſoon as they were married, and go from
          <lb/>thence to <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> found no difficulty in procuring
          <lb/>a veſſel to tranſport them  to <placeName>Guernſey</placeName>.――
          <lb/>Notwithſtanding the ſeaſon of the year, the
          <lb/>weather was mild, and the wind favourable.
          <lb/>Within ten days from their departure, <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName> brought back his wife to <persName>Mrs. Fle­

          <lb/>could divide them.</p>
            <p>They remained with their reſpectable
          <lb/>friend only two days. It was now time for

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> to be in <placeName>London</placeName>, and they haſten­
          <lb/>ed thither, too happy to reflect on what
          <lb/>was to become of them, and with no other
          <lb/>ſolicitude on their minds, than what aroſe
          <lb/>from the idea of their firſt meeting with
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>.――And this dwelt more on
          <lb/>the ſpirits of <persName>Orlando</persName>, than he choſe to
          <lb/>communicate to his wife.</p>
            <p>On their arrival in town, he ordered the
          <lb/>chaiſe to the chambers of his friend <persName>Carr</persName>,
          <lb/>as he would not abruptly introduce <persName>Moni­
          <lb/>mia</persName> to his mother. He went alone to pro­
          <lb/>cure a lodging in the neighbourhood of his
          <lb/>family; which being eaſily found, they
          <lb/>took poſſeſſion of it in the evening――as
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> required yet ſome time to prepare
          <lb/>himſelf for diſcloſing a ſecret, which he ſtill
          <lb/>feared, manage it how he would, might
          <lb/>give pain to his mother.</p>
            <p>About one o'clock, however, the following
          <lb/>morning, he went to <placeName>Howland-Street</placeName>. His
          <lb/>mother, who had been very uneaſy at his
          <lb/>long abſence, received him with even more
          <lb/>than her uſual affection; but her expreſ­

          <lb/>ſions of pleaſure at ſeeing him, were min­
          <lb/>gled with tears. All that had happened to
          <lb/>his brother, had come to her knowledge;
          <lb/>and to his exceſſive concern, he heard that
          <lb/><persName>Philip</persName>, after applying to his mother for
          <lb/>money, with which ſhe could not ſupply
          <lb/>him, had again diſappeared, and was, as
          <lb/>they had reaſon to believe, again impri­
          <lb/>ſoned.</p>
            <p>In beholding his mother under ſuch de­
          <lb/>preſſion of mind, he could not determine
          <lb/>to inform her of what might poſſibly add
          <lb/>to it; but inſtead of ſpeaking to her of
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, as he intended, he endeavoured
          <lb/>to appeaſe the agony of her mind about
          <lb/>Philip, whom he promiſed to find, and
          <lb/>gave her hopes, that they ſhould ſucceed in
          <lb/>the recovery of the <name>Rayland eſtate</name>. To
          <lb/><persName>Selina</persName> alone he communicated his recent
          <lb/>marriage; and found, with additional con­
          <lb/>cern, that ſhe dreaded the effect this intel­
          <lb/>ligence would have on her mother, who
          <lb/>was already overwhelmed with anxiety
          <lb/>for her eldeſt ſon, and whoſe maternal grief

          <lb/>had been lately awakened, by having heard
          <lb/>that her daughter <persName>Iſabella</persName> was certainly
          <lb/>living in one of the American iſlands with
          <lb/>her huſband, long after they had been
          <lb/>given over for loſt:――yet, as ſhe had never
          <lb/>heard from them, ſhe concluded, that her
          <lb/>daughter, if yet living, was totally eſtranged
          <lb/>from her family, or regardleſs of their diſ­
          <lb/>treſs; a reflection not leſs bitter than it was
          <lb/>to conſider her as dead. The doubt of 
          <lb/>what was really her fate, proved perhaps
          <lb/>more diſtreſſing than any certainty. With
          <lb/>all this, were <persName>Orlando's</persName> marriage to be diſ­
          <lb/>covered to her, while ſhe was continually
          <lb/>expreſſing her anxiety how he would him­
          <lb/>ſelf be ſupported, <persName>Selina</persName> dreaded the con­
          <lb/>ſequence of her uneaſineſs; and therefore
          <lb/>entreated <persName>Orlando</persName> to defer the diſcovery,
          <lb/>at leaſt for a few days, in hopes that ſome­
          <lb/>thing favourable might happen; while ſhe
          <lb/>herſelf expreſſed the warmeſt ſolicitude to
          <lb/>ſee and embrace <persName>Monimia</persName>, as her beloved
          <lb/>ſiſter; and they agreed that <persName>Orlando</persName> ſhould
          <lb/>find ſome pretence to take her the next

          <lb/>day out with him, and carry her to his
          <lb/>lodgings for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>With an heavy heart he now returned to
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, who anxiouſly expected him.――
          <lb/>A poor diſſembler, he could not conceal
          <lb/>from her the ſtate of his mind; but he lef
          <lb/>her to believe it was rather owing to the
          <lb/>new diſtreſs occaſioned by <persName>Philip's</persName> diſap­
          <lb/>pearance, than to any doubts as to her re­
          <lb/>ception by his mother. Her gentle and
          <lb/>ſoothing converſation was the only balm for
          <lb/>his wounded heart; and while he felt him­
          <lb/>ſelf unhappy, he conſidered how much leſs
          <lb/>ſo he was now, than when, in addition to
          <lb/>the calamities of his family, he had the loſs
          <lb/>of his <persName>Monimia</persName> to lament, and the dread of
          <lb/>all thoſe evils to which her deſolate ſtate
          <lb/>expoſed her.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had dined, he ſet out, in
          <lb/>purſuance of his promiſe to his mother, to
          <lb/>find <persName>Philip</persName>; but while <persName>Carr</persName> ſent his clerk,
          <lb/>and went himſelf to ſome of the places
          <lb/>where it was but too probably he was to be
          <lb/>found, <persName>Orlando</persName> himſelf viſited another;

          <lb/>but when they met at night at <persName>Carr's</persName> cham­
          <lb/>bers, all their enquiries were found equally
          <lb/>fruitleſs; and they agreed, that if this un­
          <lb/>happy young man was, as there was too
          <lb/>much reaſon to believe, in confinement,
          <lb/>he had taken precautions not to be diſco­
          <lb/>vered. With this unſatisfactory intelli­
          <lb/>gence, <persName>Orlando</persName>, late as it was, went back
          <lb/>to his mother; but, aſſuring her he would
          <lb/>never reſt till he had found out and re­
          <lb/>lieved his brother, he told her, that as he
          <lb/>muſt now be conſtantly engaged with <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Carr</persName> in arranging the buſineſs of the law­
          <lb/>ſuit, and muſt be at his chambers early in
          <lb/>a morning, he had taken a lodging near
          <lb/>him, the time of going ſo far as from <placeName>How­
            <lb/>land-ſtreet</placeName> to the inn of court being more
          <lb/>than he could now ſpare. This accounted
          <lb/>for his abſence tolerably well; yet his heart
          <lb/>ſmote him for this temporary deception,
          <lb/>which was however, conſidering his circum­
          <lb/>ſtances at this juncture, only a pious fraud.</p>
            <p>Another, another, and another day paſ­
          <lb/>ſed away without any news of <persName>Philip</persName>; and

          <lb/>to add to the vexation of <persName>Orlando</persName>, he found
          <lb/>new difficulties likely to ariſe in his ſuit.
          <lb/>Old <persName>Roker</persName>, to whom ſubordination of per­
          <lb/>jury was familiar, and every other infamous
          <lb/>device which an unprincipled villain could
          <lb/>be guilty of, had not only taken the uſual
          <lb/>method of gaining time by artificial delays,
          <lb/>but was, it was feared, putting it out of
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Roker's</persName> (<persName>Lennard's</persName>) power to give
          <lb/>her teſtimony againſt the will that had been
          <lb/>proved, by making her a lunatic; he was
          <lb/>infamous enough to have taken ſtill more
          <lb/>deciſive means of quieting both her con­
          <lb/>ſcience and her evidence, if they had not
          <lb/>been rendered leſs eligible by the circum­
          <lb/>ſtance of great part of her income having
          <lb/>been left her for her life only.</p>
            <p><persName>Carr</persName>, who had all the zeal of a young
          <lb/>man for his client, and was perfectly con­
          <lb/>vinced, from the ſubſtance of <persName>Mr. Walter­
            <lb/>ſon's</persName> report, that there had been another

          <lb/>therefore ſaw with anguiſh of mind his
          <lb/>own little fund dwindling away, without
          <lb/>any certainty that ſuch part of it as went to
          <lb/>the payment of law expences would ever be
          <lb/>repaid him: and the ſad idea of <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>in as great poverty as that from which he
          <lb/>had reſcued her, continually corroded his
          <lb/>heart; while ſhe, from his long delay in
          <lb/>preſenting her to his mother, and from the
          <lb/>knowledge ſhe had of his little fortune,
          <lb/>perceived but too clearly, in a depreſſion
          <lb/>of ſpirits which he could not always diſ­
          <lb/>giuſe, what were his fears. Theſe ſhe tried

            <lb/>ought to have recourſe to?</said>――<persName>Orlando</persName>,
          <lb/>who thought that all the world ought to 
          <lb/>be at the feet of a creature whoſe mind
          <lb/>ſeemed to him even more lovely than her

          <lb/>ever ſhe thus expreſſed herſelf, that ſhe by
          <lb/>degrees ceaſed to repeat it; but as he was
          <lb/>now very much out with <persName>Carr</persName>, ſhe con­
          <lb/>trived in his abſence to apply to a very con­
          <lb/>ſiderable linen warehouſe in the neighbour­
          <lb/>hood, the proprietors of which at firſt truſted
          <lb/>her with articles of ſmall value to make:
          <lb/>by degrees ſhe acquired their confidence;
          <lb/>and, by the neatneſs and punctuality of her
          <lb/>performance, entered ſoon into conſtant
          <lb/>employment.――<persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw her always
          <lb/>buſy; but he made no remarks on what

          <lb/>abled to add a little to the ſlender ſtock
          <lb/>on which depended their ſubſiſtence. Thus,
          <lb/>in continual combats with himſelf, whether
          <lb/>he ought not to acquaint his mother with
          <lb/>his ſituation, in fruitleſs enquiries after his
          <lb/>brother, and in hopes and fears about the
          <lb/>event of his ſuit, paſſed the firſt ſix weeks
          <lb/>of his marriage.――Term wa snow over, and
          <lb/>the diſcovery of the true will of <persName>Mrs. Ray­

            <p>Encouraged, however, by his friend

          <lb/>was more fondly attached as an huſband

            <p>His mother, who had been at firſt ſatiſ­

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, with an heart not much light­
          <lb/>ened by the tranſactions of the day, re­
          <lb/>turned to his lodgins to a late dinner.――
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName> was ill, a circumſtance that added
          <lb/>to the gloom that hung over him:――ſhe
          <lb/>made light of it however, and endeavoured
          <lb/>to reſtore to him that cheerfulneſs, of which,
          <lb/>ſhe obſerved with great uneaſineſs, he had
          <lb/>been ſome time deprived; but it is difficult
          <lb/>to communicate to others ſenſatgions we

          <lb/>tears were in her eyes――She aſſured him
          <lb/>ſhe ſuffered nothing; but he ſaw her pale
          <lb/>and languid, and now was confirmed in
          <lb/>what he had long fancied, that the air of
          <lb/><placeName>London</placeName> did not agree with her; and it was
          <lb/>with inexpreſſible anguiſh he reflected, that

          <lb/>health was neceſſary, he was deprived of
          <lb/>the means of procuring her country air,
          <lb/>which, as ſpring advanced, ſhe ſeemed to
          <lb/>languiſh for.――<placeName>London</placeName>, where ſhe had
          ne­
          <lb/>ver been before, was at firſt unpleaſant, and
          <lb/>now diſguſting to her; but ſhe never be­
          <lb/>trayed this but by accident, and wiſhed <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName> to believe that with him every placer
          <lb/>was to her a heaven.</p>
            <p>He now more ſeldom went to his mo­
          <lb/>ther's than he uſed to do; becauſe, ſince
          <lb/>her dialogue with <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>, all her
          <lb/>tenderneſs fo rhim did not prevent her
          <lb/>teaſing him with queſtions, and very ear­
          <lb/>neſtly preſſing him to return his uſual
          <lb/>apartment in her houſe. This ſomewhat
          <lb/>eſtranged him from his family: but in ab­

          <lb/>though he ſaw leſs of his mother and ſiſters
          <lb/>than he uſed to do, he was as fondly at­
          <lb/>tached to them as ever: and while he
          <lb/>thought he ſaw, in the conduct of his mo­

          <lb/>pain to obſerve, he imputed it all to the
          <lb/>influence of the unfeeling and mercenary
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>, and, in his moſt gloomy
          <lb/>moods, wiſhed that ſo unhappy a being as
          <lb/>he was had never been born. A thouſand
          <lb/>times he repented of his ever having left
          <lb/><name>Rayland Hall</name>, to which unfortunate ab­
          <lb/>ſence all his ſubſequent diſappointments
          <lb/>were owing; and ſometimes lamented,
          <lb/>though he could not repent, that he had
          <lb/>married his <persName>Monimia</persName>, without being able
          <lb/>to ſhielf her, as his wife, from the poverty
          <lb/>of her former lot.</p>
            <p>Nothing gave him more mortification,
          <lb/>than to find that his mother was not ſatiſ­
          <lb/>fied with his conduct in regard to <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Darby</persName>; and would not be perſuaded that
          <lb/>it was the affluence of his oppoſers, and not
          <lb/>his doubts about the cauſe, that prevented
          <lb/>his engaging in it. <persName>Mr. Woodford</persName>, taking
          <lb/>advantage of the faith his ſiſter repoſed in

          <lb/>to leave the management of the whole to
          <lb/>his uncle, and to withdraw it from <persName>Carr</persName>;
          <lb/>and wearied by theſe importunities, and by
          <lb/>the delays which the adverſe party ſeemed
          <lb/>determined ſtill to contrive, <persName>Orlando</persName> was
          <lb/>ſometimes hald tempted to give up the pur­
          <lb/>ſuit, and, with the little money he yet had
          <lb/>left, to retire to ſome remote village, where,
          <lb/>wholly unknown, he might work at any
          <lb/>certain, though laborious buſineſs, for the
          <lb/>ſupport of his wife and child:――but, when
          <lb/>he ſaw the tears that his mother ſhed in
          <lb/>ſpeaking to him of his brother <persName>Philip</persName>, who
          <lb/>had entirely deſerted his family, after hav­
          <lb/>ing, as far as he could, undone it, he could
          <lb/>not detemrine to plunge her into equal,

          <lb/>which he felt he ought to fulfil.</p>

          ſitting

          <lb/>put upon paper, when <persName>Carr</persName> came in, to
          <lb/>whom he careleſsly ſhewed it. <persName>Carr</persName>, who
          <lb/>had a taſte for poetry, deſired a copy of it;
          <lb/>to which <persName>Orlando</persName> replied, <said>that he was
            <lb/>too idle to copy it, but that he might have
            <lb/>the original, for he ſhould himſelf perhaps
            <lb/>never look at it again.</said> <persName>Carr</persName> put it into

            <p><persName>Carr</persName> had often told <persName>Orlando</persName>, as

          <lb/>attachment to literature did not prevent
          <lb/>her from taking all poſſible pains to con­
          <lb/>ceal: there was in her air, a conviction of
          <lb/>ſelf-conſequence, which predominated over
          <lb/>the tender languor ſhe affected――Indeed it
          <lb/>was towards the gentlemen only that this ſoft

          <lb/>and eſpecially thoſe who had any pretence

            <p>Though no longer young, ſhe believed

          <lb/>were irriſiſtible to all men of taſte.――They

          <lb/>with the figure and addreſs of <persName>Orlando</persName>;
          <lb/>and, amidſt the ſomething which was called
          <lb/>wit and literary converſation that now be­

          <lb/>him――enquired into his ſtudies, and his
          <lb/>taſte in poetry――beſought him to favour her
          <lb/>with ſome of his productions, and ſeemed

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, naturally of a gay temper, and
          <lb/>eaſily ſeizing the ridiculous, entered at once

          <lb/>of the houſe without noticing her gueſts.
          <lb/>After he had however paid her ſome very
          <lb/>extravagant compliments on her looks, and
          <lb/>received her anſwers, which were deſigned

          <lb/>took him by the arm, and begged he would
          <lb/>walk with him to the other end of the
          <lb/>room, where he told him, in a hurried way,

            <lb/>after a variety of diſtreſſes, and being afraid
            <lb/>of his creditors, and for other reaſons

          <lb/>where, in an attic room, very dirty and

          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>, and whoſe heart continually re­

          <lb/>guilty of towards his mother, concerted
          <lb/>with <persName>Selina</persName> the means of declaring both
          <lb/>his marriage, and the return of <persName>Iſabella</persName> to
          <lb/><placeName>London</placeName>. <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, on the point of
          <lb/>loſing one of her children, embraced, with
          <lb/>tranſport, the daughter ſhe had ſo long be­
          <lb/>lieved loſt; and though ſhe trembled for the

          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, and who mingled the pecuniary
          <lb/>favours which ſhe was obliged to owe him,
          <lb/>with admonitions and reproaches that de­
          <lb/>ſtroyed all their value, <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>
          <lb/>not only forgave <persName>Orlando</persName>, but ſeemed to
          <lb/>love him more fondly than ever. That
          <lb/>cruel want of money, which too often di­
          <lb/>vides families, and eſtranges even the child
          <lb/>from the parent, ſerved only to unite this
          <lb/>family more cloſely. The pride of <persName>War­
          <lb/>wick</persName> alone kept him at a greater diſtance
          <lb/>than the reſt; and unable, under his preſent
          <lb/>circumſtances, to appear as he once did,
          <lb/>he could not bear to appear at all before
          <lb/>thoſe, who had once ſeen him ſo different­

          <lb/>from the reſt, not only on account of his
          <lb/>coarſe jokes, but becauſe of his connection

          <lb/>eſcaping the unfeeling raillery or cold re­
          <lb/>monſtrances of her uncle, was, without

            <p>There is a degree of folly, and of vice,
          <lb/>which gradually diſſolves the tendereſt af­

          <lb/>companion of youth, and renders the ties
          <lb/>of blood the moſt galling and inſupport­
          <lb/>able chains. To this point of irreclaimable
          <lb/>miſconduct <persName>Philip Somerive</persName> had long ſince
          <lb/>arrived. He had too plainly evinced, that

          <lb/>always ſacrifice the welfare, and even the
          <lb/>ſubſiſtence of his family; yet, in his repent­
          <lb/>ance on the bed of pain and languor, his
          <lb/>mother forgot and forgave all ſhe had ſuf­
          <lb/>fered from him; and when he died, ſhe

          <lb/>fection, whoſe birth and infancy had once
          <lb/>formed her greateſt felicity.――In ſhedding
          <lb/>tears over an object once ſo beloved by
          <lb/>her huſband, ſhe ſeemed a ſecond time to
          <lb/>have loſt him; and the firſt ſubject to which
          <lb/>ſhe attended, was to have his remains de­
          <lb/>poſited with thoſe of his father, in the family
          <lb/>vault at <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In this <persName>Orlando</persName> determined that ſhe ſhould

          <lb/>to oppoſe this wiſh of his mother, in a way
          <lb/>ſo rude and ſavage, that after very high

            <p>He had then the additional difficulty 
          <lb/>of concealing this diſagreement from his
          <lb/>mother, and of finding the means to ſupply
          <lb/>that deficiency which this cruelty of his
          <lb/>uncle would create.――The little ſum left
          <lb/>of his commiſſion, after paying ſome late
          <lb/>expences of his brother's, and for his own
          <lb/>lodgings, was reduced within <measure>thirty pounds</measure>,
          <lb/>in whicch conſiſted his whole fortune. His
          <lb/>uncle, who had till now contributed yearly
          <lb/>to the ſupport of his mother and his ſiſters,
          <lb/>now proteſted that he would do no more.
          <lb/>From his eldeſt ſiſter married in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>,
          <lb/>who had a family of her own, very trifling
          <lb/>aſſiſtance only could be expected; and
          <lb/><persName>Warwick</persName> could not provide for his own
          <lb/>family. Thus <persName>Orlando</persName> ſaw, that on an
          <lb/>income of hardly an hundred a year, his
          <lb/>mother and his two unmarried ſiſters were
          <lb/>to live; and that <persName>Monimia</persName> and her family,
          <lb/>whom he could not think of ſuffering to
          <lb/>be any additional burthen to them, could
          <lb/>have no other dependance than on his ex­
          <lb/>ertions; yet into what way of life to enter,

          <lb/>or where to ſeek the means of providing
          <lb/>for them, he knew not.</p>
            <p>Sad were his reflections on the paſt,
          <lb/>on the preſent, and on the future, when
          <lb/>he ſet out with the melancholy pro­
          <lb/>ceſſion that was to convey the remains of
          <lb/>his deceaſed brother to the laſt abode of
          <lb/>the <name>Somerive family</name>; and little was the
          <lb/>correſpondence between his internal feel­
          <lb/>ings and the beauty of the ſeaſon, which
          <lb/>gave peculiar charms to the country
          <lb/>though which he paſſed.――The tears of
          <lb/>the family he had left, of which <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>was during his abſence to be a part, ſeemed
          <lb/>to have deprived him of the power of ſhed­
          <lb/>ing a tear; but with eyes that gloomily
          <lb/>ſurveyed the objects around him, without
          <lb/>knowing what he ſaw, he reached at the
          <lb/>cloſe of the ſecond day's journey <placeName>Weſt
          <lb/>Wolverton</placeName>; and at a little alehouſe, the
          <lb/>only one in the village, the funeral ſtopped
          <lb/>that night, while <persName>Orlando</persName> went out alone

            <p>It was a beautiful ſtill evening, towards
          <lb/>the end of May; but the ſenſes of the un­
          <lb/>happy <persName>Orlando</persName> were ſhut to all the plea­
          <lb/>ſures external objects could beſtow.――When
          <lb/>he had viſited the church, and ſpoken to
          <lb/>the curate, he walked back towards the
          <lb/>houſe once his father's. The graſs was
          <lb/>grown in the court, and half the windows
          <lb/>were bricked up: the greater part of the
          <lb/>ſhrubs in the garden were cut; and the
          <lb/>gates out of repair, and broken. All wore
          <lb/>an appearance of change and of deſolation,
          <lb/>even more deplorable, in the opinion of
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, than the ſpruce alterations, and
          <lb/>air of new born proſperity, which, on his
          <lb/>former viſit, he had remarked as the effect o
          <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Stockton's</persName> purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Pain, and even horrors, were grown fa­
          <lb/>miliar to <persName>Orlando</persName>; and he ſeemed to have
          <lb/>a gloomy ſatisfaction in the indulgence of
          <lb/>his melancholy. He opened, therefore,
          <lb/>the half-fallen gate, that led from a ſort of
          <lb/>lawn, that ſurrounded the houſe, to the
          <lb/>ſhrubbery and pleaſure ground, and entered

          <lb/>the walk which he had ſo often traverſed with
          <lb/>his father, and where he had taken his laſt
          <lb/>leave of him on his departure for <placeName>America</placeName>.
          <lb/>――The moon, not yet at its full, ſhed a
          <lb/>faint light on every object: he looked
          <lb/>along a ſort of viſta of ſhrubs, which ſeemed
          <lb/>to have been left merely becauſe they were
          <lb/>not yet wanted as firing; and the moon­
          <lb/>light, at the end of this dark avenue of
          <lb/>cypreſs and gloomy evergreens, ſeemed par­
          <lb/>tially to illuminate the walk, only to ſhew
          <lb/>him the ſpectre of departed happineſs. He
          <lb/>remembered with what pleaſure his father
          <lb/>uſed to watch the growth of theſe trees,
          <lb/>which he had planted himſelf; and with
          <lb/>what ſatisfaction he was accuſtomed to con­
          <lb/>ſider them, as improving for <persName>Philip</persName>.――Sad
          <lb/>reverſe!――The father, who thus fondly
          <lb/>planned future ſchemes of felicity for his
          <lb/>ſon, long ſince mouldered in the grave,
          <lb/>wither that ſon humſelf, after having been
          <lb/>but too acceſſary to the premature death of
          <lb/>this fond parent, was now, in the bloom of

          <lb/>life, precipitated by his own headlong
          <lb/>folly.</p>
            <p>A temper ſo ſanguine as that of <persName>Orlando</persName>,
          <lb/>poſſeſſes alſo that ſenſibility which arms
          <lb/>with redoubled poignancy the ſhafts of af­
          <lb/>fliction and diſappointment. He felt, with
          <lb/>cruel acuteneſs, all the calamities which a
          <lb/>few ſhort years had brought upon his fa­
          <lb/>mily:――all their hopes blaſted――there for­
          <lb/>tune gone――their name almoſt forgotten in
          <lb/>the country――and ſtrangers poſſeſſing their
          <lb/>habitations. He now remembered that he
          <lb/>uſed to think, that, were he once bleſſed
          <lb/>with <persName>Monimia</persName>, every other circumſtance of
          <lb/>life would be to him indifferent: yet ſhe
          <lb/>was now his――ſhe was more beloved, as his

          <lb/>and the ſweetneſs of her temper, the excel­
          <lb/>lence of her heart, the clearneſs of her
          <lb/>underſtanding, and her tender attachment
          <lb/>to him, rendered her infinitely dearer to
          <lb/>him, than that beauty which had firſt at­
          <lb/>tracted his early love. But, far from being

          <lb/>rendered indifferent to every other circum­
          <lb/>ſtance, he felt that much of his preſent
          <lb/>concern aroſe from the impoſſibility he
          <lb/>found of ſheltering this adored creature
          <lb/>from the evils of indigence; and that the
          <lb/>romantic theory, of ſacrificing every conſi­
          <lb/>deration to love, produced, in the practice,
          <lb/>only the painful conſciouſneſs of having
          <lb/>injured its object.</p>
            <p>It was late before the unhappy wanderer
          <lb/>returned to the place where he was to at­
          <lb/>tempt to ſleep; but the mournful ceremony
          <lb/>of the next day, added to the gloomy
          <lb/>thoughts he had been indulging, deprived
          <lb/>him of all inclination to repoſe; and as he
          <lb/>ſaw the ſun ariſe which was to witneſs the
          <lb/>interment of his brother――how different
          <lb/>appeared its light now, from what it uſed
          <lb/>to do, when from the ſame village, in the
          <lb/>houſe of his father, he beheld it over the
          <lb/>eaſtern hills, awakening him to hope and
          <lb/>health――to the ſociety of a happy cheerful
          <lb/>family――and to the proſpect of meeting his
          <lb/>little <persName>Monimia</persName>, then a child, who innocently

          <lb/>expreſſed the delight ſhe felt in ſeeing
          <lb/>him<unclear>!</unclear></p>
            <p>But to indulge theſe painful reflections
          <lb/>appeared to him unmanly, while they were
          <lb/>likely to diſable him from the exerciſe of
          <lb/>the melancholy duties before him. Theſe
          <lb/>at length over, he found himſelf, in deſpite
          <lb/>of all his philoſophy, ſo much depreſſed,
          <lb/>that he could not determine to return that
          <lb/>night towards <placeName>London</placeName>; but ſending away
          <lb/>the undertaker's people, and retaining for
          <lb/>himſelf the horſe on which one of them had
          <lb/>rode, he reſolved to paſs the reſt of the day
          <lb/>in gratifying the ſtrange inclination he had
          <lb/>long felt, to wander about <placeName>Rayland Park</placeName>,
          <lb/>to viſit the Hall, and take a laſt leave of
          <lb/>that ſcene of his early happineſs, the turret
          <lb/>once inhabited by <persName>Monimia</persName>.</p>
            <p>This plan would detain him from her
          <lb/>another day; but he felt an invincible in­
          <lb/>clination to make this farewel viſit, which
          <lb/>he knew <persName>Monimia</persName> herſelf would wiſh him
          <lb/>to indulge. Having therefore diſengaged
          <lb/>himſelf from the gloomy duties of the day,

          <lb/>and ſent a few lines to his mother and <persName>Mo­
          <lb/>nimia</persName>, to account for his abſence, if the
          <lb/>man who carried it ſhould arrive in town
          <lb/>before him, he ſet out towards evening for
          <lb/>the Hall, flattering himſelf that, as he was
          <lb/>now known, and made a better appearance
          <lb/>than on his former viſit, he ſhould without
          <lb/>difficulty obtain afmittance to the houſe.――
          <lb/>In this, however, he was miſtaken: he 
          <lb/>found many of the windows bricked up,
          <lb/>the œconomy of the preſent poſſeſſors not
          <lb/>allowing them to pay ſo heavy a window
          <lb/>tax: the old ſervants hall below was en­
          <lb/>tirely deprived of light; and hardly a veſ­
          <lb/>tige remained of inhabitants, in the graſs-
          <lb/>grown courts and ſilent deſerted offices.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, after waiting for ſome time at
          <lb/>the foor, before he could make any one
          <lb/>hear, ſaw at length the ſame ſturdy clown
          <lb/>he had before ſpoken to, who aſked him in
          <lb/>a ſurly tone his buſineſs.――<persName>Orlando</persName> replied,
          <lb/>that he deſired to be allowed to ſee the
          <lb/>houſe. The man anſwered, that he had 
          <lb/>poſitive orders from <persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName> to

          <lb/>ſhew the houſe to nobody; and he ſhut
          <lb/>the door in his face.</p>
            <p>Thus repulſed, <persName>Orlando</persName> only felt a more
          <lb/>determined reſolution to gratify himſelf by
          <lb/>a viſit to the library, the chapel, and the 
          <lb/>turret; and he went round the houſe with
          <lb/>an intention to enter without permiſſion by
          <lb/>the foor that opened near the former out of the
          <lb/>ſummer parlour――Here, however, he was
          <lb/>again diſappointed: this door, as well as the
          <lb/>windows in the ſame line with it, was nailed
          <lb/>up, and boarded on the inſide; and while
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> thus baffled was examining the
          <lb/>other wing of the houſe, to ſee if he could
          <lb/>not there obtain entrance, the man who
          <lb/>guarded it looked from a window above,
          <lb/>and told him, that if any body was ſeen 
          <lb/>about the houſe he ſhould fire at them, for
          <lb/>that <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">nobody had no
            buſineſs there.</said></p>
            <p>From the ſavage brutality of his manner,
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName> had little doubt but that he would
          <lb/>act as he ſaid; yet, far from fearing his
          <lb/>fire-arms, he told him that he would ſee
          <lb/>the houſe at all events, and that oppoſition

          <lb/>would only ſerve to give more trouble, but
          <lb/>not deter him from his purpoſe. He then
          <lb/>attempted to bribe this guardian of the
          <lb/>property of the church, and offered him a
          <lb/>handful of ſilver: but his anſwer was, that
          <lb/>he ſhould fetch his blunderbuſs.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> now thought that it would be
          <lb/>better to return to <placeName>Weſt Wolverton</placeName>, and to
          <lb/>write to a lawyer iun the neighbourhood,
          <lb/>employed by <persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName> in the ma­
          <lb/>nagement of the eſtate, requeſting leave to
          <lb/>ſee the houſe; though he foreſaw that it would
          <lb/>be difficult to make ſuch a man comprehend
          <lb/>the ſort of ſenſations that urged him to this
          <lb/>requeſt――and that it was poſſible he might
          <lb/>impute his deſire of viſiting the Hall to
          <lb/>motives that might make him refuſe his
          <lb/>permiſſion.――Reſolved however to try, he
          <lb/>returned ſlowly and diſconſolate through
          <lb/>the part; and obſerved, as he reached the
          <lb/>ſide of it next the lake, that in the copſe
          <lb/>that clothed the hill many of the large
          <lb/>trees were felled, and ſome others marked
          <lb/>for the axe.――His heart became more heavy

          <lb/>than before; and when he reached the
          <lb/>ſeat near the boat-houſe in the fir-wood,
          <lb/>which was now indeed broken down, he
          <lb/>reſted a moment againſt the old tree it
          <lb/>had once ſurrounded, to recover from the
          <lb/>almoſt inſupportable deſpondence which
          <lb/>oppreſſed him.</p>
            <p>Abſorbed in the moſt melancholy
          <lb/>thoughts, every object ſerved to increaſe
          <lb/>their bitterneſs――He liſtened to ſounds once
          <lb/>ſo pleaſing with anguiſh of heart border­
          <lb/>ing upon deſpair, and almoſt wiſhed that
          <lb/>he had been drowned in this water when
          <lb/>a boy, by the accident of falling from a
          <lb/>boat as he was fiſhing on the lake, from
          <lb/>whence his father's ſervant had with diffi­
          <lb/>culty ſaved him.</p>
            <p>In ſuch contemplations he remained for
          <lb/>ſome time, with his eyes fixed on the water,
          <lb/>when he ſaw reflected in its ſurface the
          <lb/>image of ſome object moving along its
          <lb/>bank.――The figure, from the gentle waving
          <lb/>of the water as it approached the ſhore;
          <lb/>was not diſtinct; and its motion ſo ſlow

          <lb/>and ſingular, that the curiouſity of <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>was ſomewhat awaked. As it came nearer
          <lb/>to him, therefore, he ſtepped forward, and
          <lb/>ſaw advancing with difficulty on his
          <lb/>crutches the old beggar whom he had met
          <lb/>in a bard in <placeName>Hampſhire</placeName> four months ſince,
          <lb/>when he waited for communication with
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Roker</persName>.</p>
            <p>However ſurpriſed <persName>Orlando</persName> was at the
          <lb/>appearance of this perſon, the man himſelf
          <lb/>ſeemed to have expected to meet him;
          <lb/>for, advancing towards him as ſpeedily as
          <lb/>his mutilated frame would allow, he ex­
          <lb/>claimed, <said>Ah! my dear maſter! well met:

            <p>
              <said>Have you been looking for me then,

            </p>
            <p>
              <said>Aye, marry have I――and many a
            <lb/>weary mile have my leg and my crutches
            <lb/>hopped after your honour――Why, mun, I've 
            <lb/>been up at <placeName>London</placeName> after you; and there at
            <lb/>the houſe where you give me a direction to,

            <lb/>get of him was telling me that you were
            <lb/>come down here――I knows this country
            <lb/>well enough; and ſo I e'en ſet off, and partly

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, not gueſſing why this wander­

          <lb/>was about, however, to aſk what he could
          <lb/>do for him, when the old man, putting on

            <lb/>from <persName>Madam Roker</persName>――A power of trouble,
            <lb/>and many a cold night's waiting I had to

          <lb/><persName>Dr. Hollybourn</persName>; and he determined, late

          <lb/>He ſet forward, therefore, attended by
          <lb/><persName>Dawſon</persName>, two other young men of the ſame

          <lb/>the perſons who were to execute the war­
          <lb/>rant. It was midnight when they arrived
          <lb/>at the Hall――All was profoundly ſilent
          <lb/>around it, and it had no longer the appear­
          <lb/>ance of an inhabited houſe. The ſum­
          <lb/>mons, however loud, was unanſwered. As
          <lb/>the men rapped violently at the old door
          <lb/>of the ſervant's hall, the ſullen ſounds mur­
          <lb/>mured through the empty courts, and to
          <lb/>their call only hollow echoes were re­
          <lb/>turned. Theſe attempts to gain admittance
          <lb/>were repeated again and again without
          <lb/>effect, and they began to conclude, that
          <lb/>there was nobody within the houſe; but at

            <p>Upon hearing there was  a

          <lb/>gaged in the ſame ſort of buſineſs as that
          <lb/>which uſed to be carried on by <persName>Pattenſon</persName>
          <lb/>and Company, imagined immediately that
          <lb/>he had been informed againſt: but as there
          <lb/>was no remedy, he came down with fear
          <lb/>and trembling to open the door; and it was
          <lb/>a great relief to him to learn, that it was
          <lb/>only for a paper, which might occaſion the

          <lb/>of his effects that the intended ſearch was

          <lb/>the place indicated by the letter of <persName>Mrs.

          <lb/>and traverſed the long dark paſſages that
          <lb/>led towards the apartment in queſtion, <persName>Or­
            <lb/>lando</persName> could not, amid the anxiety of ſuch
          <lb/>a moment, help fancying, that the ſcene
          <lb/>reſembled one of thoſe ſo often met with in
          <lb/>old romances and fairy tales, where the

          <lb/>viſible drawer, where a hand or an head is
          <lb/>found ſwimming in blood, which it is his
          <lb/>buſineſs to reſtore to the inchanted owner.
          <lb/>With a beating heart, however, he ſaw the
          <lb/>picture of <persName>Lady Alithea</persName> removed, and
          <lb/>the ſliding board appears. On entering
          <lb/>the cloſet, the tin box, covered with a
          <lb/>green cloth, was diſcovered. The key
          <lb/>which <persName>Orlando</persName> poſſeſſed opened it, and the
          <lb/>caſket was within it; which he unlocked, in
          <lb/>preſence of all the perſons preſent, and ſaw
          <lb/>the important paper, exactly as it had been
          <lb/>deſcribed by <persName>Mrs. Roker</persName>.</p>
            <p>He now debated whether he ſhould open
          <lb/>it; but at length, with the advice of his
          <lb/>friend <persName>Dawſon</persName>, determined not to do ſo
          <lb/>till his arrival in <placeName>London</placeName>. Replacing every
          <lb/>thing elſe as it was found, and ſecuring the
          <lb/>cloſet and the room that led to it, he now
          <lb/>haſtened to reward the perſons who had at­

          <lb/>two children of <persName>Iſabella</persName>, who were playing
          <lb/>on the carpet.――She received him with that
          <lb/>degree of tranſport which ſhewed itſelf in

          <lb/>(which he had repreſented as the moſt ab­

          <lb/>ſtances of cruelty had inflicted; and had

            <p><persName>Orlando</persName>, who felt that ſome precaution
          <lb/>was neceſſary, in revealing to <persName>Monimia</persName> the
          <lb/>fortunate reverſe that now preſented itſelf,
          <lb/>was conſidering how to begin this propi­
          <lb/>tious diſcovery, when his mother, who ea­
          <lb/>gery expected him, having learned from
          <lb/>the ſervants that he was arrived, ſent down
          <lb/><persName>Selina</persName> to beg to ſee him.</p>
            <p>She put back the curtain as he came into

          <lb/>particulars ſhe expected, which however
          <lb/>ſhe had not courage to aſk, filled her heart
          <lb/>with bitterneſs, and her eyes with tears.</p>

          <lb/>extreme emotion the hand ſhe gave him――
          <lb/>He thanked her, after a moment's ſilence,
          <lb/>for her goodneſs to <persName>Monimia</persName> during the
          <lb/>few days of his abſence; and entreated her
          <lb/>to be in better ſpirits. He then gradually
          <lb/>diſcovered to her, by a ſhort and clear re­
          <lb/>lation of what had happened, the aſſurance
          <lb/>he now had, which the tranſactions of that
          <lb/>evening would, he hoped, confirm, of a
          <lb/>ſpeedy change in their circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The heart of <persName>Mrs. Somerive</persName>, ſo long

          <lb/>were likely to be at once reſcued from the
          <lb/>indigence which impended over them, and
          <lb/>ſecured in affluence and proſperity, could
          <lb/>not be heard with calmneſs. At length
          <lb/>both herſelf and her ſon acquired compo­
          <lb/>ſure enough to conſider of the proper ſteps
          <lb/>to be taken. Every perſon intereſted was

          <lb/>had taken into their hands, but to refund
          <lb/>the rents and the payments for timber;
          <lb/>which operation went to the poor Doctor's

          <lb/>out againſt her a commiſſion of lunacy. It
          <lb/>was ſuperſeded on the application of <persName>Or­
          <lb/>lando</persName>, who himſelf immediately conducted
          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Roker</persName> to <name>Rayland Hall</name>; where he
          put
          <lb/>her in poſſeſſion of the apartments ſhe had
          <lb/>formerly occupied; and employed her to
          <lb/>ſuperintend, as ſhe was ſtill active and
          <lb/>alert, the workmen whom he directed to
          <lb/>repair and re-furniſh the houſe, and the
          <lb/>ſervants whom he hired to prepare it for
          <lb/>the reception of its lovely miſtreſs. He
          <lb/>forbore to purſue <persName>Roker</persName> himſelf, as he
          <lb/>might have done; having no pleaſure in
          <lb/>revenge, and being rather ſolicitous to give
          <lb/>to thoſe he loved future tranquillity, than
          <lb/>to avenge on others thoſe paſt misfortunes,
          <lb/>which perhaps ſerved only to make him
          <lb/>more ſenſible of his preſent felicity.</p>
            <p>Fortune, as if weary of the long perſecu­
          <lb/>tions the <name>Somerive family</name> had experienced,
          <lb/>ſeemed now reſolved to make them amends

          <lb/>by ſhowering her favours upon every branch
          <lb/>of it. <persName>Warwick</persName> had hardly rejoiced a week
          <lb/>in the good fortune of <persName>Orlando</persName>, when he
          <lb/>received a ſummons to attend <persName>General
          <lb/>Tracy</persName>; who, quite exhauſted by infirmity,
          <lb/>ſaw the end of his life approaching, and ſa­
          <lb/>crificed his reſentment, which time had al­
          <lb/>ready conſiderably weakened. He was not,
          <lb/>however, yet able to ſee <persName>Iſabella</persName>; but his
          <lb/>pride had been alarmed by the accounts
          <lb/>he had received of <persName>Warwick's</persName> diſtreſſed
          cir­
          <lb/>cumſtances, and above all, of his having a
          <lb/>play coming forward at one of the theaters;
          <lb/>which, though it was to paſs as the work of
          <lb/>an unknown young author, with a ſuppo­
          <lb/>ſititious name, was well known to be, and
          <lb/>publicly ſpoken of as his. That <emph>his</emph>
          <lb/>nephew――that the nephew of an Earl ſhould
          <lb/>become an author and write for ſupport,
          <lb/>was ſo diſtreſſing to the haughty ſpirit of
          <lb/>the old ſoldier, that though he ſaw many
          <lb/>examples of the ſame thing in people of
          <lb/>equal rank, he could not bear it; and the
          <lb/>very means his brother's family took to
          <lb/>irritate him againſt <persName>Warwick</persName> by informing

          <lb/>him of this circumſtance, contributed more
          <lb/>than any thing elſe to the reſolution he
          <lb/>formed of ſeeing his nephew, and reſtoring
          <lb/>him to his favour. <persName>Warwick</persName> immediately
          <lb/>agreed to withdraw his play. His uncle
          <lb/>burnt the will by which he had been diſin­
          <lb/>herited, and died about five months after­
          <lb/>wards, bequeathing to his two boys by
          <lb/><persName>Iſabella</persName>, all his landed eſtates, after their
          <lb/>father, who was to enjou them, together
          <lb/>with his great perſonal property, for his
          <lb/>life.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the happy <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>had conducted his lovely wife, his mother
          <lb/>and his ſiſters, to <name>Rayland-Hall</name>; where,
          <lb/>without ſpoiling that look of venerable an­
          <lb/>tiquity for which it was ſo remarkable, he
          <lb/>collected within it every comfort and every
          <lb/>elegance of modern life. With what grate­
          <lb/>ful tranſports did he now walk with <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>over the park, and talk with her of their early
          <lb/>pleaſures and of their ſevere ſubſequent ſuf­
          <lb/>ferings! and how ſenſible did theſe retroſpects
          <lb/>render them both of their preſent happineſs!</p>

          <lb/>diſputed poſſeſſion of his eſtate, before
          <lb/>he preſented to each of his ſiſters <measure>five
            <lb/>thouſand pounds</measure>; and, to add to his power
          <lb/>of gratifying his mother, it happened that
          <lb/>very ſoon after his arrival at <name>Rayland Hall</name>
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Stockton</persName> dies, the victim of that in­
          <lb/>temperance which exorbitant wealth and
          <lb/>very little underſtanding had led him into.
          <lb/>As he had no children, his very large pro­
          <lb/>perty was divided among diſtant relations,
          <lb/>his joint-heirs; <name>Carloraine Caſte</name> was ſold,
          <lb/>pulled down by the purchaſer, and the park
          <lb/>converted into farms; and in this diviſion
          <lb/>of property, the houſe and eſtate at <placeName>Weſt
            <lb/>Wolverton</placeName>, formerly belonging to the <name>Some­
          <lb/>rive family</name>, were to be ſold alſo. This
          <lb/>his paternal houſe had been inhabited by
          <lb/>farmers, under tenants of <persName>Stockton</persName>, when
          <lb/><persName>Orlando's</persName> laſt melancholy viſit was paid to
          <lb/>it. He now purchaſed it; and putting it
          <lb/>as nearly as he could into the ſame ſtate as
          <lb/>it was at the death of his father, he preſented
          <lb/>it to his mother with the eſtate around it;
          <lb/>and thither ſhe went to reſide with her two
          <lb/>youngeſt daughters, though they all occa­

          <lb/>ſionally paid viſits to the Hall, particularly
          <lb/><persName>Selina</persName>, of whom <persName>Orlando</persName> and
          his <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>were equally fond.</p>
            <p>Incapable of ingratitude, or of forgetting
          <lb/>for a moment thoſe to whom he had once 
          <lb/>been obliged, <persName>Orlando</persName> was no ſooner happy
          <lb/>in his reſtored fortune, than he thought of
          <lb/>the widoe of his military friend <persName>Fleming</persName>.
          <lb/>To <persName>Fleming</persName> himſelf he owed it, that he
          <lb/>exiſted at all;――to his widow, that an ex­
          <lb/>iſtence ſo preſerved, had not been rendered
          <lb/>a curſe by the eſtrangement or loſs of
          <lb/><persName>Monimia</persName>.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt uſes therefore that he made
          <lb/>of his aſſured proſperity, was, to remove
          <lb/>from this reſpectable protectreſs of his be­
          <lb/>loved <persName>Monimia</persName>, the mortifications and in­
          <lb/>conveniencies of very narrow circumſtances.
          <lb/>He wrote to her, entreating to ſee her at
          <lb/>the Hall with her children, and that ſhe
          <lb/>would ſtay there at leaſt till after the acceſ­
          <lb/>ſion of happineſs he was to expect in the
          <lb/>autumn. Towards the middle of Sep­

          <lb/><persName>Monimia's</persName> gallant young friend the ſailor,
          <lb/>to whom ſhe owed her providential intro­
          <lb/>duction to <persName>Mrs. Fleming</persName>, unexpectedly
          <lb/>made his appearance. He returned from a
          <lb/>very ſucceſsful cruize; he was made a
          <lb/>lieutenant, and had obtained leave of ab­
          <lb/>ſence for ten days, to comfort with theſe
          <lb/>tidings the heart of his widowed mother;
          <lb/>when, not finding her at her uſual habitation
          <lb/>in the <placeName>New Foreſt</placeName>, he had followed her to
          <lb/><name>Rayland Hall</name>, where he was a moſt wel­
          <lb/>come gueſt.</p>
            <p>This young man, who was in diſpoſition
          <lb/>and in figure the exact repreſentative of
          <lb/>his father, could not long be inſenſible of
          <lb/>the charms of the gentle <persName>Selina</persName>; and he
          <lb/>ſpoke to <persName>Orlando</persName> of the affection he had
          <lb/>conceived for her, with his natural ſincerity.
          <lb/><persName>Orlando</persName>, who never felt the value of what
          <lb/>he poſſeſſed, ſo much as when it enabled
          <lb/>him to contribute to the happineſs of his
          <lb/>friends, ſeized with avidity an offer which
          <lb/>ſeemed ſo likely to conſtitute that of his
          <lb/>beloved ſiſter; and he had the happineſs in
          <lb/>a few days of diſcovering that the old ſea
          <lb/>officer, <persName>Fleming's</persName> relation and patron, was
          <lb/>ſo well pleaſed with his gallant behaviour
          <lb/>in the engagement he had lately been in,
          <lb/>that he had determined to make him his
          <lb/>heir, and moſt readily conſented to make a

          <lb/>the fortune <persName>Orlando</persName> had given his ſiſter;
          <lb/>and it was ſettled that <persName>Selina</persName> and <persName>Lieutenant
          <lb/>Fleming</persName> ſhould in a few months be united.</p>
            <p><persName>Orlando</persName> was very ſoon after made com­
          <lb/>pletely happy by the birth of a ſon, to
          <lb/>whom he gave his own name, and who ſeem­
          <lb/>ed to render his charming mother yet more
          <lb/>dear to all around her. Every ſubſequent
          <lb/>hour of the lives of <persName>Orlando</persName> and his <persName>Monimia</persName>
          <lb/>was marked by ſome act of beneficence;
          <lb/>and happy in themſelves and in their con­
          <lb/>ections, their gratitude to Heaven for the
          <lb/>extenſive bleſſings they enjoyed, was ſhewn
          <lb/>in contributing to the cheerfulneſs of all
          <lb/>around them.</p>
            <p>In the number of thoſe, who felt the ſun­
          <lb/>ſhine of their proſperity, and prayed for its
          <lb/>continuance, no individual was more ſincere
          <lb/>in his joy, or more fervent in repeated ex­
          <lb/>preſſions of it, than the uſeful old military
          <lb/>mendicant, whoſe ſingular ſervices <persName>Orlando</persName>
          <lb/>rewarded by making him the tenant for life
          <lb/>of a neat and comfortable lodge in his

          <lb/>never paſſed through his own gate without
