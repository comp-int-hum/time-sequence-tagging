<lb/>double Force on poor <persName>Eovaai</persName>, by having
<lb/>none near to comfort her, or bear a part in
<lb/>this Affright: She call'd to her Attendants,
<lb/>who were in another Alley in the Garden;
<lb/>but they, no leſs terrified than herſelf, ei­

<lb/>and ſhe was expos'd alone, and without any

        <p><hi>At</hi> length the Elements, as having

<lb/>Vapours diſpers'd; the blue Screne again
<lb/>appear'd; and the bright Planet of the
<lb/>Univerſe returned to gild the Hills: Nature
<lb/>ſeem'd now recover'd, and ſmil'd in all her

<lb/>her Kingdom, acquainted them, with Tears,
<lb/>of the Accident had befallen her; and en­
<lb/>treated their Advice how to behave, that the
<lb/>Woes denounced againſt her by the laſt
<lb/>Words of <persName>Eojaeu</persName>, might be averted.</p>
        <p><hi>But</hi> how great a Change did the Reci­

<lb/>She immediately perceived the Influence ſhe

<lb/>a general Diſcontent diffuſed itſelf through­

<lb/>all the Love and Reverence with which ſhe
<lb/>had been treated, was now no more; and
<lb/>whereſoever ſhe turn'd her Eyes, ſhe met with
<lb/>nothing but upbraiding Looks, or cold and
<lb/>inforced Civilities. The Conſequence of this
<lb/>ſad Alternative were ſecret Plots, or open
<lb/>Rebellions againſt her Government: <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>
<lb/>became the Scene of Civil War, Father a­

<lb/>they endeavoured to cultivate his Mind with
<lb/>all poſſible Improvements. And, to that
<lb/>end, put him under the Tuition of a vir­

<lb/>of too arrogant and impatient a Spirit to
<lb/>endure Controul, or go through the tedious
<lb/>and gradual Forms by which Youth ordina­
<lb/>rily arrive at Knowledge: He therefore ſet
<lb/>himſelf to the Study of the worſt Sort of
<lb/>Magic, renounced the Powers of Goodneſs,
<lb/>and devoted all his Faculties to the ſervice
<lb/>of the <name>Ypres</name>; by whoſe aſſiſtance, he be­
<lb/>came, in a ſhort time, ſo expert in the per­

<lb/>ting in practice the moſt difficult Enchant­
<lb/>ments. As he was extremely amorous, and
<lb/>had ſo little in him to inſpire the tender Paſ­

<mw type="catch">to</mw>
<pb n="19"/>
<milestone n="B10r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">19</mw>
<lb/>to transform himſelf into the reverſe of what 
<lb/>he was: Not that he had Power to change
<lb/>the Work of Nature, or make any real Al­
<lb/>teration in his Face or Shape, but to caſt
<lb/>ſuch a Deluſion before the Eyes of all who
<lb/>ſaw him, that he appeared to them ſuch as
<lb/>he wiſhed to be, a moſt comely and grace­
<lb/>ful Man.</p>
        <p><hi>With</hi> this Advantage, join'd to the
<lb/>moſt ſoothing and inſinuating Behaviour,
<lb/>he came to Court, and, by his Artifices,
<lb/>ſo wound himſelf into the Favour of ſome

<lb/>he diſcharged ſo well, that he was ſoon pro­
<lb/>moted to a better, and at length to thoſe of 
<lb/>the higheſt Truſt and Honour in the King­
<lb/>dom. But that which was moſt remarkable
<lb/>in him, and very much contributed to en­
<lb/>dear him to all Sorts of People, was that
<lb/>his Elevation did not ſeem to have made
<lb/>the leaſt Change in his Sentiments. His
<lb/>natural Pride, his Luſt, his exorbitant Am­
<lb/>bition were diſguiſed under the Appearance
<lb/>of Sweetneſs of Diſpoſition, Chaſtity, and
<lb/>even more Condeſcenſion, than was conſi­
<lb/>ſtent with the Rank he then poſſeſt. By this
<lb/>Behaviour, he render'd himſelf ſo far from

<lb/>Diſcerning ſaw not into his Deſigns, till he
<lb/>found means to accompliſh them, to the al­
<lb/>moſt total Ruin of both King and People.</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> Places he held, giving him fre­

<lb/>Penetration, ſuch as his, to diſcover what
<lb/>Failings had harbour in the Royal Breaſt;
<lb/>and finding a little Vanity in Dreſs was moſt
<lb/>predominant, was continually inventing new
<lb/>Faſhions and communicating them to him
<lb/>for his Approbation. Among other gay
<lb/>Ornaments, <persName>Oeros</persName> was particularly fond of
<lb/>Feathers; ſeveral of which he always wore
<lb/>either on his Breaſt, or Shoulders, or about
<lb/>the Hilt of his Dagger; nay, he would

<lb/><persName>Ochihatou</persName> ſeeing this, by his <anchor xml:id="a015" corresp="#N015" rend="pre(*)"/><emph>Æriel</emph> Agents,
<lb/>procured one pluck'd from the Phoenix
<lb/>Wing, and having dipt it in a pernicious Li­

<lb/>the Charm, that <persName>Oeros</persName> had no ſooner put

<lb/>than a ſudden Infatuation ſeized his ſacred

<lb/>gy; nor had he Eyes or Ears for any thing
<lb/>that was not preſented to him by the En­
<lb/>chanter; ſo that he became, in effect, no

        <p><hi>Having</hi> thus attain'd an abſolute

<lb/>After which, all who were eminent for

<lb/>out of their Employments, whether Civil or
<lb/>Military, diſcharged from their Attendance
<lb/>at Court, and their Places filled up with
<lb/>Wretches, whom natural Baſeneſs, or oc­

<lb/>to his Intereſt. He next proceeded to ſeize
<lb/>the publick Treaſure into his own Hands,
<lb/>which he converted not to Works of Juſtice

<lb/>of the Kingdom <anchor xml:id="a017" corresp="#N017" rend="pre(*)"/>, but in building ſtately

<lb/>with Juſtice, Clemency, Magnanimity, and

<lb/>Oppreſſor. The poor <name>Hypotofans</name>,

<lb/>ſome Foreigners, ſome Natives, but all under
<lb/>the Command of Chiefs, who were entirely
<lb/>his Creatures, and were diſperſed through
<lb/>every part of the Kingdom, in order to awe
<lb/>the People into Submiſſion. Beſides theſe,
<lb/>he had a kind of Civil Army, compoſed
<lb/>of the loweſt and moſt profligate of Man­
<lb/>kind; they were call'd <anchor xml:id="a020" corresp="#N020" rend="pre(*)"/>and employ'd in

<lb/>the military Forces, to whom they were
<lb/>little inferiour in Number. But this exe­
<lb/>crable Stateſman, thinking himſelf not ſuf­
<lb/>ficiently ſecured by impoveriſhing and en­
<lb/>ſlaving a People, who, till this dreadful
<lb/>Æra, had boaſted of more Wealth and Li­
<lb/>berty than any Nation in the World, took
<lb/>Meaſures alſo to corrupt their Morals, and
<lb/>to render all kinds of Vice ſo univerſal,
<lb/>that his own might paſs unremark'd. To
<lb/>this end, he choſe the <emph>Hiahs</emph>, or Chief
<lb/>Prieſts, out of different Sectaries, of which
<lb/>at that time there were many in <placeName>Hypotofa</placeName>. 
<lb/>Theſe held publick Diſputations concerning
<lb/>ſome nice Points in Divinity; and each ex­
<lb/>claiming virulently againſt the Tenets of
<lb/>the other, ſo puzzled the Underſtanding of
<lb/>the weaker ſort, that many of them began
<lb/>to think, there was no Neceſſity of ob­
<lb/>ſerving any Rules of Devotion, and that all
<lb/>Religion was an Artifice, invented only by
<lb/>a Set of Men, to hold an Authority over
<lb/>the Soul. This brought every thing ſacred
<lb/>into Contempt; Men openly deſpis'd the

<lb/>and no longer invok'd the Protection of the

of
<lb/>enjoying a Princeſs of ſuch uncommon Per­

<lb/>him to look on every thing he wiſhed as

<lb/>whoſe Nearneſs of Blood and Conformity
<lb/>of Principles made entirely his own, and
<lb/>took a Journey to <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>, where he
imme­
<lb/>diately liſted himſelf among the Adorers of

<lb/>under the Protection of the divine <persName>Aiou</persName>, all
<lb/>his Enchantments were of no Efficacy, to
<lb/>delude the Eyes, or enſnare the Reaſon of
<lb/>any there. So that appearing in his real De­
<lb/>formity of Body, his Talents of Wit and

<lb/>juſt to preſerve him from Contempt; and
<lb/>he returned to <placeName>Hypotofa</placeName>, curſing Nature,

<lb/>Diſappointment. But his Rage was conver­

        <p><hi>Amidst</hi> the Calamities, in which

it

        <p><hi>All</hi> the time ſhe was undreſſing, theſe

<lb/>contemptible. She now, for the firſt time,
<lb/>conſidered the Perfections of her Perſon:

<lb/>and, from this moment, aſſumed an innate

<lb/>ſudden Conſciouſneſs of her own Beauty had
<lb/>inſpired, was now, perhaps, of more ſervice
<lb/>to her than all the grave Leſſons of Virtue

<lb/>Perplexities, and, at laſt, Deſpair. This
<lb/>Conſideration made her vigorouſly repel his

        <p><hi>Here</hi> ſhe concluded, and turned
<lb/>from him with a Look which ſhewed ſhe
<lb/>meant much more than ſhe was able to

<lb/>ſhe was ſpeaking, the Force of her juſt
<lb/>Reproaches had ſtruck him to the Soul:
<lb/>'tis poſſible, that in this moment he felt
<lb/>ſomething like Remorſe, but wanting
<lb/>Virtue to repent, was ſoon emboldned by
<lb/>the Fierceneſs of <persName>Tygrinonniple</persName>. <said xml:id="sp47">You uſe

	    <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName> given to
<lb/>you for a Slave; but I have that will
<lb/>bend her ſtubborn Heart.</said>  In ſpeaking
<lb/>theſe laſt Words, ſhe made a Sign to the
<lb/>Guards, who, having received Orders be­
<lb/>fore in what manner they ſhould behave,
<lb/>immediately ſeized on the unhappy Prin­
<lb/>ceſs, and carried her to a Dungeon, which
<lb/>had no other Light than juſt enough to
<lb/>ſhew the Horror of it.  There was ſhe
<lb/>ſtript of all her Regal Ornaments, and
<lb/>in their ſtead her delicate Limbs loaded
<lb/>with maſſy and corroſive Fetters. What
<lb/>Suſtenance ſhe received was Scraps from
<lb/>the Table of her cruel Perſecutors, brought
<lb/>to her by the Hands of Men, whoſe
<lb/>very Aſpect was ſufficient to ſtrike Ter­
<lb/>ror in any Heart leſs reſolute than her's;
<lb/>but ſhe appeared ſo far from being daunt­
<lb/>ed, that even in this deplorable Situation
<lb/>the Majeſty of her Deportment inſpired
<lb/>thoſe, who had the Care of her, with a
<lb/>Reverence, which rendered them ſcarce
<lb/>capable of executing the Commands of
<mw type="catch">their</mw><pb n="59"/><milestone n="D6r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">59</mw>
<lb/>their unrelenting Miſtreſs. The truth
<lb/>is, <persName>Yamatalallabec</persName> ſo took up all her
<lb/>Thoughts, that ſhe had no leiſure to
<lb/>reflect on any Calamities which related
<lb/>immediately to herſelf: for him alone ſhe
<lb/>trembled; for him alone ſhe offer'd up
<lb/>her Vows; and the Dangers to which
<lb/>ſhe knew he muſt neceſſarily be expoſed,
<lb/>were all the Ideas of her waking or her ſleep­
<lb/>ing Hours. It is a Tradition credited by
<lb/>many, that the Conſtancy and Patience
<lb/>with which ſhe ſupported this miſerable
<lb/>Bondage, gave more pain to <persName>Tygrinon­
<lb/>niple</persName> and <persName>Broſcomin</persName>, than their
moſt ſtu­
<lb/>died Malice could inflict on her. How­
<lb/>ever that be, perceiving all their Seve­
<lb/>rities were unavailing, they had recourſe
<lb/>to other Means. They removed her from
<lb/>that loathſome Priſon to a handſome A­
<lb/>partment in the Palace, they placed Wo­
<lb/>men about her for Attendants; the
<lb/>Guards waited at an humble Diſtance,
<lb/>nothing but Liberty was denied her.
<lb/><persName>Tygrinonniple</persName> ſent Compliments to her
be­
<lb/>fitting one Princeſs to another; and <persName>Broſ­
<lb/>comin</persName> viſited her with all the Obſequi­
<lb/>ouſneſs of the moſt reſpectful Lover. But
<lb/>her Soul, which had ſo magnanimouſly
<lb/>ſtood the Shocks of Cruelty, was alſo
<lb/>too well guarded againſt the Inſinuations
<lb/>of Flattery, for this ſudden Change in

<lb/>their Behaviour, to work any Alteration
<lb/>in her Sentiments. She looked on their
<lb/>Inſults and Civilities with a like Indiffe­
<lb/>rence, and ſcorning to imitate them in
<lb/>Diſſimulation, declared by all her Words
<lb/>and Actions, that ſhe was ſtill the ſame,
<lb/>and ever would be ſo.</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> natural Haughtineſs of
<persName>Tygri­
<lb/>nonniple</persName>, and the Impatience of
<persName>Broſcomin</persName>,
<lb/>to ſee himſelf confirmed on the Throne
<lb/>of <placeName>Ginkſy</placeName>, would ſuffer neither of them
<lb/>to remain long in this Uncertainty; and
<lb/>the Meſſages of the one, nor the perſonal
<lb/>Addreſſes of the other, having been able
<lb/>to draw no Anſwer from the Mouth of
<lb/><persName>Yximilla</persName> ſuitable to their purpoſe, they
<lb/>reſolved to put an end to the Affair by
<lb/>other means.</p>
        <p><hi>They</hi> gave Orders that the chief

<lb/>prized at ſight of them; but ſuſpecting,
<lb/>that there was ſome fatal Meaning in this

<lb/>for the Event. <said xml:id="sp49">Princeſs</said>, ſaid

<lb/>dragg'd than led up to the Altar, where
<lb/>ſtood the Chief Prieſt ready to receive her
<lb/>at the Head of his venerable Band. At
<lb/>ſight of him a Dawn of Hope began to
<lb/>beam once more upon her: That holy
<lb/>Man had been Witneſs of her Contract
<lb/>with <persName>Yamatalallabec</persName>, had always encou­
<lb/>raged her to keep it unviolated, and had te­
<lb/>ſtified himſelf a thouſand ways one of the
<lb/>greateſt Admirers of that Prince's Vir­
<lb/>tues. As ſhe had a long Experience of
<lb/>his Principles, and knew he had an entire
<lb/>Command over the Inferior Officiates at
<lb/>the Altar, ſhe imagined he neither would
<lb/>perform the dreadful Ceremony of giving
<lb/>her to <persName>Broſcomin</persName>, himſelf, nor ſuffer
them
<lb/>to do it; and as ſoon as ſhe came near
<mw type="catch">enough</mw><pb n="64"/><milestone n="D8v" unit="sig"/>

<lb/>enough to be heard by him; <said xml:id="sp60">Father</said>,

        <p><hi>Thus</hi> with ſtreaming Eyes, and

<lb/>ſo much reſolved as he had ever ſeemed:
<lb/>But, alas! ſhe too ſoon found what wicked

<lb/>and ſad Example of human Frailty. This
<lb/>ſaint-like Man, this Herald of the Gods,
<lb/>this Dictator to the Souls of a whole

<lb/>worſe Treatment, had aſſured <persName>Tygrinon­
<lb/>niple</persName> and <persName>Broſcomin</persName> of his Readineſs to
<lb/>perform whatever they enjoin'd; and as
<lb/>he expected no leſs from the Courage and
<lb/>Conſtancy of <persName>Yximilla</persName>, than what ſhe now
<lb/>expreſſed, was prepared with Arguments
<lb/>for his Excuſe: He told her, that he had
<lb/>received a Mandate from above;—That
<lb/>it was the Will of the Celeſtial World,
<lb/><persName>Broſcomin</persName> ſhould be King, and by no o­
<lb/>ther Method of proceeding <placeName>Ginkſy</placeName> could
<lb/>be reſtored to Peace. He added, no
<lb/>Man had a more true Regard for the

<lb/>labec</persName> than himſelf, but muſt ſubmit to
<lb/>the ſupreme Beings, who had revealed to
<lb/>him in Viſions their Decrees in favour of
<lb/>the other; and therefore he deſired ſhe
<lb/>would conform her Sentiments accordingly,
<lb/>and not attempt any Diſturbance of the
<lb/>Sacred Rites. He might have ſpared this
<lb/>laſt Remonſtrance; for <persName>Yximilla</persName>
perceiv­

<lb/>of the Abſence of her Senſes, pronounc'd
<lb/>the myſtic Words which indiſſolubly uni­

<lb/>Their Heads were ſhadowed with the ſa­

<lb/>bed upon their Hands, and all the Solem­
<lb/>nities of Marriage nigh perform'd before
<lb/>this unhappy Queen return'd to a Condi­
<lb/>tion of knowing what had happened;
<lb/>and when ſhe did, in vain were all Pro­
<lb/>teſts, her Cries, or Imprecations. She
<lb/>was born back to the Palace in the ſame
<lb/>manner ſhe had been brought thence,
<lb/>and put into Bed; where, in ſpite of all
<lb/>her Oppoſition, ſhe became the raviſhed
<lb/>Bride of the triumphant <persName>Broſcomin</persName>.</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> Hardſhips all this while

infe­

<lb/>ſuch as to ſupport with Patience and For­

<lb/>Variety of Climates and of Dangers.
<lb/>Sometimes, thro' trackleſs Deſarts, he
<lb/>made his painful Marches; ſometimes, in

<lb/>moſt inveterate Enemies; now climbing
<lb/>Hills of Ice, then panting, and almoſt

<lb/>as a Brother and a King, eſtabliſhed a
<lb/>Court for him, and omitted nothing which
<lb/>he thought might be any kind of Conſo­

        <p><hi>There</hi> was he, from day to day,

<lb/>wholly devoted to the Will of the Gods.
<lb/>But it was remarkable, that what not all

<lb/>Millions of glittering Atoms, ſuch as

        <p><hi>What</hi> more dreadful than this
<lb/>Solitude can Imagination figure out! No
<lb/>Mark of any Footſtep, no Path to direct
<lb/>the forlorn Princeſs in her uncertain Pil­
<lb/>grimage, no graſſy Bank on which ſhe
<lb/>might repoſe, nor Tree to ſhelter her
<lb/>from the rude Winds, or more injurious
<lb/>Sun, but all around a Scene of Deſola­
<lb/>tion. She expected no leſs than to periſh,
<lb/>nor indeed was there the leaſt Appearance
<lb/>ſhe ſhould do otherwiſe; yet did ſhe wan­
<lb/>der on for ſeveral Hours, tho' altogether
<lb/>unſuſtain'd by Hope; ſometimes falling
<lb/>thro' Faintneſs, and at every Step her
<lb/>tender and delicate Feet ſmearing with
<lb/>Blood the ſharp and flinty Way. At
<lb/>laſt overcome by Hunger, and Thirſt,
<lb/>Pain, and Wearineſs, Nature could no
<lb/>more; and the Soul of this fair and
<lb/>bewildered Traveller was juſt about to
<lb/>yield up all its Faculties, when caſting
<lb/>her almoſt dying Eyes a little towards
<lb/>the Right, ſhe imagined ſomewhat like
<lb/>a Building preſented itſelf to view, but
<lb/>at ſo great a diſtance, that ſhe could not

<lb/>however ſo much renewed her Strength,
<lb/>that ſhe was enabled to advance that

<lb/>that ſhe had not been flatter'd with a

<lb/>vain Conjecture. She ſaw a ſpacious
<lb/>Caſtle, ancient, but not ruinated, built
<lb/>all of Stone, and ſeemed no leſs durable
<lb/>than the Rock on which it was ſituated.
<lb/>No Painting, Gilding, or carv'd Work,
<lb/>adorn'd this Structure, erected for Uſe
<lb/>not Oſtentation; yet had in this plain
<lb/>Magnificence ſomething which ſhamed
<lb/>the pompous Geugaws invented by Luxury
<lb/>and Pride. <persName>Eovaai</persName> found ſo much dif­
<lb/>ficulty in climbing the ſteep Aſcent, that
<lb/>ſhe began to fear ſhe ſhould be obliged
<lb/>to paſs the Night, which now drew on,
<lb/>only with the Conſolation of knowing
<lb/>herſelf near to a Place of Reſt, without
<lb/>being able to partake any of the Bene­
<lb/>fits of it. But Time and Patience aſſiſt­
<lb/>ing her Endeavours, at length ſhe gain'd
<lb/>the Summit, from whoſe commanding
<lb/>Height, ſhe had a full Proſpect of the
<lb/>direful Vale beneath; and having in a
<lb/>ſhort Ejaculation acknowledg'd her De­
<lb/>liverance from all the Dangers of it,
<lb/>turned her Sight on a more pleaſing View.
<lb/>On a huge Oak, which grew juſt before
<lb/>the Caſtle Gate, ſhe ſaw a Silver Trum­
<lb/>pet hang, and beneath it a Tablet of the 
<lb/>ſame Metal, on which was engraved in
<lb/>large Capitals theſe Words:

<lb/><hi rend="case(allcaps)align(center)">Who would fly corruption,

<lb/>Here the Remembrance of thoſe abomi­
<lb/>nable Principles ſhe had ſo readily im­
<lb/>bibed from the Mouth of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, and
<lb/>from the Practice of which, ſhe had ra­
<lb/>ther been terrified than perſuaded, drew
<lb/>Tears from her Eyes. She thought the
<lb/>Task impoſed on Human Kind, by the
<lb/>Supreme Powers, was too ſevere: <said xml:id="sp83">O

<lb/>cry'd ſhe, <said xml:id="sp84">can nothing but our Torments
<lb/>be acceptable to <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Heaven</placeName>? Why muſt
<lb/>our Pains alone be Virtue, and all our
<lb/>Pleaſures Vice?</said> But theſe prophane Ex­
<lb/>poſtulations laſted not long; they were
<lb/>but the Dictates of perverted Nature,
<lb/>and Reaſon aſſiſting the Leſſons of her
<lb/>Youth, enabled her to look up to Joys
<lb/>more noble and refined, than can be
<lb/>found in the utmoſt Gratification of the
<lb/>Senſes. Being now reſolved to fly Cor­
<lb/>ruption, and have an Abhorrence for
<lb/>Vice, ſhe took Courage to ſound the
<lb/>Trumpet; on which the Gate was im­
<lb/>mediately opened, and ſhe received into
<lb/>a ſpacious Hall, adorn'd with Statues and

<lb/>Attempt, immortal Men, true Sons of

<lb/>with a Wreath of Laurel, but none en­

<lb/>teſtifying ſome Surprize, a Servant who
<lb/>had been explaining to her the different
<lb/>Hieroglyphicks engraven on the Pedeſ­
<lb/>tals, told her with a Smile, that it was

<lb/>the Pride of <emph>Crowns</emph>, not wear them.
<lb/>Theſe Words to one who was a Queen

<lb/><persName>Glaza</persName> not only rid his Dominions of ſo
for­

<lb/>into <placeName>Tolzag</placeName>, ſubdued many fine Provinces,

<lb/>an entire Victory over the <name>Bitzians</name>, and
<lb/>brought alſo that Monarch in triumph to

ſenſible
<lb/>of the Injuſtice of their Cauſe, expected
<lb/>no leſs than the moſt ſevere Treatment;
<lb/>but our generous Princes made them ſee,
<lb/>that Hoſpitality, and a Readineſs in for­
<lb/>giving Offences, were Virtues in which,

<lb/>all other Nations in the World; exacting
<lb/>no other Ranſom for their Liberty and for­

<lb/>of this Kingdom; and, from the other, a
<lb/>formal Reſignation of ſome of thoſe Ci­

<lb/>vice to our Commerce. Thus were all
<lb/>the Acquiſitions of theſe Conqueſts turned
<lb/>to the advantage of the Subjects, while
<lb/>our glorious Sovereigns contented them­

<lb/>which the Power and Will of doing good

        <p><hi>The</hi> Character given to the Princeſs
<lb/>of <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>, of this excellent King and
<lb/>Queen, was ſo conformable to what <persName>Eo­

<lb/>to be, that it drew Tears from her Eyes;
<lb/>but the Gentleman repelled thoſe regret­
<lb/>ful Meditations ſhe was about to fall into,
<lb/>by obliging her to turn her eyes on an­
<lb/>other ſcepter'd Hero, not far diſtant from
<lb/>the former. He ſeem'd in that Bloom of
<lb/>Life, which, one may ſay, is but juſt ar­
<lb/>rived at Maturity; yet, with the Fire of
<lb/>Youth, was mingled all the Wiſdom of
<lb/>Old-Age; fierce, but yet ſweet: So ad­
<lb/>mirably were the commanding and be­
<lb/>ſeeching Air united in every graceful Fea­

<lb/>ture, as render'd him awefully lovely,
<lb/>and delightfully auſtere. As ſcorning Eaſe
<lb/>he ſtood, not ſat upon a Throne: In one
<lb/>extended Hand he held a Sword of more
<lb/>than common Size; in the other, a Scep­
<lb/>ter ornamented with Doves, the Emblems
<lb/>of ſoft Peace. On either ſide was erected
<lb/>an Adamantine Pillar reaching to the Ceil­
<lb/>ing, on which were engraven the Hiſtory
<lb/>of his Battles, and his Sieges, the many
<lb/>Dangers he had eſcaped, and the Victories
<lb/>he had gained. But becauſe it wou'd have
<lb/>taken up too much time for <persName>Eovaai</persName>, to
<lb/>have examined every Particular of theſe
<lb/>curious Hieroglyphicks, the Gentleman
<lb/>continued to ſatisfy her Curioſity in as brief
<lb/>a manner as he could. <said xml:id="sp91">This</said>, ſaid he, <said xml:id="sp92">is

<lb/>left a Pattern for Poſterity, more eaſily
<lb/>admired than imitated. The whole Bu­
<lb/>ſineſs of his glorious but ſhort Life, was
<lb/>to render his People happy at home, and
<lb/>reverenced abroad: With a Handful of
<lb/>Men, in compariſon of the Number of
<lb/>his Enemies, he over-run one of the moſt
	    <lb/>potent Empires of the <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName>, annex'd the

<lb/>Work of as many Ages.</said> <said xml:id="sp93">Oh! how

<lb/>tended a Right to the Crown; the reigning

<lb/>and Miniſter, who regarded more their pri­
<lb/>vate Intereſt than the Publick-Good, and
<lb/>were ſuſpected to live in a more than beco­
<lb/>ming Intimacy: By this means the royal Au­
<lb/>thority fell into contempt; the Noblemen
<lb/>ſet themſelves up for Heads of different
<lb/>Factions, the Populace liſted under their
<lb/>ſeveral Banners; and, while domeſtick
<lb/>Jarrs took up the Minds of all, foreign
<lb/>Acquiſitions were no longer ſupported,

<lb/>brought her back to thoſe Principles from
<lb/>which the Deluſions of <persName>Ochihatou</persName> had made
<lb/>her ſwerve; and, at the ſame time, eſta­
<lb/>bliſh'd ſo perfect a Harmony in her mind,
<lb/>that ſhe ſcarce felt any Remains of the
<lb/>Fatigues ſhe had undergone. So great is
<lb/>the Power of Wiſdom over a Soul capable
<lb/>of taſting its Joys, that while ſhe heard
<lb/>him ſpeak, ſhe forgot all Cauſes of In­
<lb/>quietude, and cou'd have liſtned to him,
<lb/>with an Infinity of Pleaſure, a much
<lb/>longer time, if he had not reminded her,
<lb/>that it was proper for her to allow Nature

        <p><hi>The</hi> Adventures which had befallen

<lb/>to apprehend, give her half that Anxiety,
<lb/>as the Shame of having abandon'd her
<lb/>ſelf, tho' but for a few moments, to Plea­
<lb/>ſures ſo contrary to the Modeſty of her
<lb/>Sex, and ſo much beneath the Dignity
<lb/>both of her Birth and Underſtanding:
<lb/>but as ſhe cou'd not think how near ſhe
<lb/>was to being loſt, without remembring
<lb/>ſhe was not wholly ſo, the Diſquiets oc­
<lb/>caſion'd by the one, were eaſily diſperſed
<lb/>by the ſweet Contentment which the other
<lb/>afforded; and ſhe ſunk, by degrees, into

<lb/>ſhou'd be the direct Oppoſites to each o­

no­
<lb/>thing was to be ſeen but exceſſive Gran­

<lb/>and Luxury and Poverty were things

<lb/>'Tis true, the Deſire of Riches ſeem'd the

<lb/>but then, they ſought not the Gratifica­

<lb/>others laboured for. Thus every Indivi­

<lb/>that of the Publick; and all no leſs una­
<lb/>nimous than vigorous in the common
<lb/>Cauſe, they ſo well knew how to profit
<lb/>by the Sloth or Timidity of other Na­

<lb/>even to the fartheſt Parts of the habitable

<lb/>As to the firſt it is meerly viſionary;

<lb/>No, I can eaſily prove the contrary. Is
<lb/>not the Power of conferring all Titles,
<lb/>Honours, and Badges of Diſtinction, en­

        <p><hi>As</hi> ſhe was in this ſad Situation,
a
<lb/>Monkey which was faſtned by a Chain
<lb/>to one Corner of the Room, and was be­
<lb/>fore unnoticed by her, leap'd ſuddenly
<lb/>againſt the Wall, and having pulled down
<lb/>a <anchor xml:id="a071" corresp="#N071" rend="pre(*)"/>Tablet, came and preſented it to
her
<lb/>between its Paws. The Oddneſs of this 
<lb/>Action made her a little recover the
<lb/>Power of Reflection, and perceiving the
<lb/>Creature pointed to ſome Words engra­
<lb/>ven on it, and at the ſame time put itſelf
<lb/>into a Poſture more expreſſively beſeech­
<lb/>ing, than could be accounted for, in an
<lb/>Animal void of Reaſon; ſhe could not
<lb/>help believing there was ſome extraordi­

<lb/>Accident; and examining the Characters,

<lb/>and endeavouring, if poſſible, to com­

<lb/>three times over; which ſhe had no ſooner
<lb/>done, than, to her inexpreſſible Amaze­
<lb/>ment, ſhe ſaw before her, inſtead of the
<lb/>Monkey, a Woman, of a very graceful
<lb/>Appearance, tho' pretty far advanced in
<lb/>Years. This ſudden and ſtrange Tranſ­
<lb/>formation deprived her for a Moment
<lb/>of the uſe of more than half her Facul­
<lb/>ties; ſhe was all Eyes, and thoſe were
<lb/>fixed rather in a ſtupid than enquiring
<lb/>State; which the other perceiving, <said xml:id="sp132">Let

<lb/>the World<choice><sic/><corr>␣</corr></choice>itſelf, and by my Mother's, from
<lb/>a Branch of the Blood Royal of
<placeName>Aſſadid</placeName>.
<lb/>It was in that Court where I firſt ſaw
<lb/>Light, where I was bred in all the gay
<lb/>Delights of Life; and where I might ſtill
<lb/>have dwelt in Pomp and Honour, had I
<mw type="catch">either</mw><pb n="138"/><milestone n="G9v" unit="sig"/>
<mw rend="align(left)" type="pageNum">138</mw>
<lb/>either ſooner, or not at all, experienced
<lb/>a Paſſion, which has no Medium in its
<lb/>Conſequences, and never fails to render
<lb/>the Perſon poſſeſt of it extremely happy
<lb/>or extremely miſerable. As I never could
<lb/>boaſt an extraordinary Beauty, ſo I wanted
<lb/>not enough of the Agreeable to make me
<lb/>very much admired. My Youth, beſides
<lb/>that Chearfulneſs which is almoſt inſepa­
<lb/>rable from it, was accompanied with a
<lb/>certain Air; which I have been told,
<lb/>even by thoſe leaſt concern'd to pleaſe me,
<lb/>had ſomething in it more attractive than
<lb/>the moſt dazling Whiteneſs of Skin, or
<lb/>Regularity of Features. However it
<lb/>was, no Lady about Court was treated
<lb/>with more Reſpect and Obſequiouſneſs
<lb/>by her Lovers, or had a more numerous
<lb/>Train of them. Had they been fewer,
<lb/>and their Devoirs leſs flattering, perhaps
<lb/>I had not been the Wretch I am, but my
<lb/>Vanity was ſwell'd till it overwhelm'd
<lb/>my Reaſon: I began to fancy myſelf
<lb/>born only to be adored, and that I me­
<lb/>rited more than all Mankind could pay.
<lb/>I could not think of parting with my
<lb/>Power over ſo many Slaves for any Con­
<lb/>ſideration; wholly untouch'd by any ſoft
<lb/>Emotion, in the pain I gave them con­
<lb/>ſiſted my chief Pleaſure; and never re­
<lb/>flecting that every Day ſtole from me
<mw type="catch">ſomething</mw><pb n="139"/><milestone n="G10r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">139</mw>
<lb/>ſomething of my Charms, that a terrible
<lb/>Decay would ſoon enſue, and all my
<lb/>Triumphs wither with my Bloom; I
<lb/>looked on all the Overtures of Marriage
<lb/>made me by my Friends, as ſo many In­
<lb/>dignities to my Beauty's Prerogative; and 
<lb/>declared myſelf ſo great an Enemy to that
<lb/>State, that in time they forbore preſſing
<lb/>me. I was two and twenty when I en­
<lb/>tered myſelf among the Number of thoſe
<lb/>Virgins who attended the Princeſs <persName>Syl­
<lb/>lalippe</persName>, then an Infant of five Years old;
<lb/>and tho' I had frequent Hints from my
<lb/>Companions of the Diſparity of my Age
<lb/>with theirs, none of them exceeding ſix­
<lb/>teen or ſeventeen, I <anchor xml:id="a072" corresp="#N072" rend="pre(*)"/>took all
they ſaid
<lb/>as the Effects of Envy for my ſuperior
<lb/>Perfections; and tho' I hated them for
<lb/>it, was far from being mortified myſelf.
<lb/>Thus did I ſuffer Years after Years to roll
<lb/>away without one ſerious Thought, nor
<lb/>would be prevailed upon to quit my Poſt
<mw type="catch">of</mw><pb n="140"/><milestone n="G10v" unit="sig"/>
<mw rend="align(left)" type="pageNum">140</mw>
<lb/>of Maid of Honour, till by remaining
<lb/>in it I became the Deriſion of the whole
<lb/>Court; and the Queen herſelf, in pity of
<lb/>my Weakneſs, obliged me to exchange
<lb/>it for firſt Woman of the Bedchamber,
<lb/>the Princeſs being now arrived at an Age
<lb/>to have her Houſhold ſettled, in a man­
<lb/>ner befitting the Heireſs of Empire, ſhe
<lb/>being the only Child; and indeed it was
<lb/>done with a Splendour not at all infe­
<lb/>riour to that of her Royal Parents. To
<lb/>expreſs the Charms of that young Beauty
<lb/>would be impoſſible; ſo I ſhall only ſay,
<lb/>none but thoſe you are Miſtreſs of could
<lb/>come in any Competition with them;
<lb/>nor were thoſe of her Mind leſs to be
<lb/>admired. She had all the Softneſs of our
<lb/>Sex, without any of the Affectation;
<lb/>Wit, unaccompanied by Vanity; and
<lb/>Virtue, without Pride. She beheld half
	    <lb/>the Princes of the <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName> dying at her Feet,
<lb/>with a Pity excited by the Generoſity of
<lb/>her Nature, but entirely free from that
<lb/>Senſibility of their Paſſion, which each
<lb/>endeavour'd to inſpire. As ſhe had no
<lb/>Averſion to Marriage, ſo ſhe yet diſco­
<lb/>vered not the leaſt Inclination to it; and
<lb/>the King and Queen, who loved her with
<lb/>the Tenderneſs ſo many amiable Quali­
<lb/>ties merited from them, would not urge
<lb/>her overmuch upon a Theme they found 
<mw type="catch">not</mw><pb n="141"/><milestone n="G11r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">141</mw>
<lb/>not pleaſing to her. But at length the
<lb/>fatal Moment arrived, which was to con­
<lb/>vince both her and the unfortunate <persName>Ata­
<lb/>madoul</persName>, that Love, by being long re­
<lb/>pulſed, triumphs but the more. <persName>Ochihatou</persName>
<lb/>came to <placeName>Aſſadid</placeName>, and had the Boldneſs
<lb/>to declare his Pretenſions to my Princeſs:
<lb/>the Gracefulneſs of his Perſon, the en­
<lb/>gaging Manner of his Addreſs, his Wit,
<lb/>his Gallantry, and perhaps his Science,
<lb/>had ſo powerful an Effect, that he no
<lb/>ſooner came, than conquer'd; her Heart
<lb/>that had withſtood the Aſſaults of ſo
<lb/>many Sovereign Princes, yielded to the
<lb/>firſt Summons of a Man no way her equal;
<lb/>and as ſhe was of a Humour averſe to all
<lb/>kinds of Deceit, ſhe endeavoured not to
<lb/>diſguiſe the Tenderneſs he had inſpired her
<lb/>with, but gave him all the Proofs of it
<lb/>that Modeſty would permit. Their Ma­
<lb/>jeſties, however, were ſo highly offended
<lb/>at his Preſumption, that they forbad him
<lb/>the Court and Kingdom, and ſtrictly en­
<lb/>join'd the Princeſs to hold no farther
<lb/>Communication with him, either by Let­
<lb/>ters or Meſſages. She was too dutiful
<lb/>a Daughter to do any thing contrary to
<lb/>their Will, and reſolved a perfect Obe­
<lb/>dience to this Command, tho' much the
<lb/>ſevereſt ſhe had ever received. The Ago­
<lb/>nies ſhe endured in the Conflict, between
<mw type="catch">Virtue</mw><pb n="142"/><milestone n="G11v" unit="sig"/>
<mw rend="align(left)" type="pageNum">142</mw>
<lb/>Virtue and Inclination, were ſo violent,
<lb/>that to behold them, would have drawn
<lb/>Tears from any Eyes, but thoſe of a
<lb/>Rival; but I muſt confeſs my Cruelty in
<lb/>this Point, I loved <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, had envied
<lb/>her the Conqueſt of his Heart, and felt
<lb/>the extremeſt Satisfaction in finding there
<lb/>was a Bar, which I knew would be in­
<lb/>diſſoluble, put between the Completion of
<lb/>their mutual Deſires. As the Gratification
<lb/>this gave my Malice was all I could hope;
<lb/>ſo, for ſome moments, 'twas all I wiſh'd:
<lb/>But alas! the burning Paſſion, for I can
<lb/>call it no other, with which I was in­
<lb/>flamed, ſoon reminded me, that Revenge
<lb/>afforded but an imperfect Bliſs. I
<lb/>found, I could not live without the
<lb/>Sight of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, and as he was ob­
<lb/>liged to quit <placeName>Aſſadid</placeName> for ever, the
Pain
<lb/>my beautiful Rival ſuſtained, wou'd
<lb/>but ſerve to ſhew my own Miſery in
<lb/>the ſtronger Colours, who languiſhed
<lb/>in the ſame Calamity, without the Con­
<lb/>ſolation of being pitied, or even thought
<lb/>on by the dear Author of our common
<lb/>Woes. Reflections, ſuch as theſe, put
<lb/>me on racking my Invention how to make
<lb/>the Diſappointment of their Loves ſub­
<lb/>ſervient to my own Aim; and <persName>Syllalippe</persName>,
<lb/>honouring me with a perfect Confidence,
<lb/>I perſuaded her, that neither Duty nor

<lb/>Reaſon demanded ſhe ſhou'd be ſo far un­
<lb/>grateful to the Paſſion of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, as
<lb/>to ſuffer him to depart, without letting
<lb/>him know at leaſt, that ſhe bore an equal
<lb/>Share in his Misfortune. Overcome by
<lb/>the Arguments induſtrious Love inſpired
<lb/>me with, ſhe at length conſented I ſhou'd
<lb/>go to him in her Name, and ſay every
<lb/>thing I thought proper for his Conſola­
<lb/>tion. I cannot ſay, that I flatter'd my
<lb/>ſelf with any thing further in this Viſit,
<lb/>than the Pleaſure of ſeeing him again,
<lb/>and talking to him; my Vanity had re­
<lb/>ceived ſo many Mortifications of later
<lb/>Years, that I cou'd not hope he wou'd
<lb/>turn his Addreſſes to me, ſince diſappoin­
<lb/>ted in them to my Princeſs: yet did I
<lb/>ſpare nothing that day, which I thought
<lb/>might contribute to the rendring me a­
<lb/>greeable; but alas! his Behaviour to me
<lb/>ſoon convinced me, the Errand on which
<lb/>I came, was all that recommended me
<lb/>to his Civilities. He expreſſed ſo much
<lb/>Deſpair, at the Thoughts of never ſeeing
<lb/><persName>Syllalippe</persName> more, that I was ready to burſt
<lb/>with ſpite; and the violent Emotions of
<lb/>my Heart making a viſible Alteration in
<lb/>my Countenance, he, little ſuſpicious of
<lb/>the real Motive, imagined it proceeded
<lb/>only from my Compaſſion.</said> <said xml:id="sp139">Kind

<lb/>him my Interceſſion, join'd with her ex­

<lb/>her Duty and Allegiance; that ſhe con­

come
<lb/>into the Palace Garden when it grew
<lb/>dark; where, if he cou'd provide any
<lb/>means for her eſcape, ſhe wou'd put her
<lb/>ſelf under his direction, for her whole fu­

<lb/>ved theſe Tidings is not to be expreſs'd;
<lb/>he called me the Preſerver of his Life, the

	    <lb/>wiſh'd on <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName>; and tho' he never wants
<lb/>Words to declare his Meaning in the moſt

<lb/>Tongue flow with ſuch harmonious Elo­

<lb/>I did; and perceiving me at a diſtance,
<lb/>ran to me, catch'd me in his Arms,
<lb/>preſs'd me to his Boſom with an Ardor
<lb/>which ſhew'd the Vehemence of his Paſ­
<lb/>ſion; I trembling, between the Extaſy
<lb/>his Careſſes gave me, and the Fears of
<lb/>being diſcover'd, had now little the Power
<lb/>of making uſe of any Artifice; yet the
<lb/>Confuſion I was in, appeared ſo like what
<lb/>might be expected from the Modeſty of
<lb/>the real <persName>Syllalippe</persName>, that perhaps it was of

<mw type="catch">for</mw><pb n="149"/><milestone n="H3r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">149</mw>
<lb/>for Congratulations, he utter'd ſome my­

<lb/>ſeem'd made of one entire Emrald,
<lb/>and drawn by ſix wing'd Horſes, imme­
<lb/>diately preſented it ſelf before us: We
<lb/>went into it, and were no ſooner ſeated,
<lb/>than our aerial Steeds bore us far above
<lb/>the Tops of the moſt lofty Turrets. Not
<lb/>Thought it ſelf was quicker than our
<lb/>Flight; my Head was giddy with the Ra­
<lb/>pidity; but he, more accuſtomed to ſuch
<lb/>Ætherial Voyages, ſhewed not the leaſt
<lb/>Alteration, but continued kiſſing and em­
<lb/>bracing me, with Tranſports ſuch as
<lb/>leaves me no room to doubt, he wou'd
<lb/>have proceeded, even in that hurrying
<lb/>moment of our Paſſage, to the laſt Gra­

<lb/>been deterr'd by the knowledge that the

<lb/>from the Shock I believed muſt attend
<lb/>the firſt Diſcovery of this Diſappoint­

<lb/>that when he ſhou'd conſider there was no

<lb/>Love; I fell upon my knees, I kiſs'd his

<lb/>tions had made in my Heart, in the moſt
<lb/>tender and moſt paſſionate Terms, and
<lb/>begged he would rather <emph>kill</emph> than <emph>hate</emph> me
<lb/>for what I had done. The Extremity of
<lb/>his Rage not permitting him to ſpeak, I
<lb/>had full Opportunity to ſay every thing
<lb/>that I thought might move him to Com­

<lb/>the ſtruggling Paſſion, which I believe
<lb/>wou'd elſe have choak'd him, vented it

<lb/>confounded with the horrid Proſpect, ſhe
<lb/>put her Glaſs again into her Pocket, and
<lb/>bleſs'd the Darkneſs which defended her

<lb/>With theſe Words, he took a little Wand

<lb/>ſtruck her on the Head, ſhe immediately
<lb/>became a huge grey Rat; and as if fear­
<lb/>ful of ſomething yet worſe than this Tranſ­

<lb/>ing, by that ſubmiſſive Poſture, to avert

<lb/>from her, he muttered ſome Words in a
<lb/>very low Voice, tho' had he ſpoke much
<lb/>higher, they would have been wholly
<lb/>unintelligible to the Princeſs; which
<lb/>ended, he took her in his Arms, and bore
<lb/>her down a Pair of Stairs which led into
<lb/>the Garden. A large Machine, in form
<lb/>like a Lanthorn, and ſeemed made of
<lb/>Cryſtal, ſtood at the Entrance of one of
<lb/>the Walks, into which having thrown
<lb/>her, with the Air rather of a Tyrant
<lb/>than a Lover, he went in himſelf, and
<lb/>the ſame Inſtant an inviſible Hand lifted
<lb/>them up in Air, and they went with the
<lb/>Rapidity of Lightning many thouſand
<lb/>Leagues above all the Globes viſible to
<lb/>mortal Sight. <persName>Eovaai</persName> had been ſo ter­
<lb/>rified with what ſhe had ſeen happen to
<lb/>the unfortunate <persName>Atamadoul</persName>, that ſhe had
<lb/>ſuffered herſelf to be put into this en­
<lb/>chanted Lanthorn, without making the 
<lb/>leaſt Reſiſtance, and was but now begin­
<lb/>ning to reflect on the Miſeries that threat­
<lb/>ned her, thus entirely ſubjected to the
<lb/>Will of the Enchanter, when all at once
<lb/>they deſcended, and the Vehicle which
<lb/>had conveyed them in a moment vaniſh'd.
<lb/><persName>Ochihatou</persName> all the time of their Paſſage
had
<lb/>not once opened his Mouth, nor even caſt
<lb/>his Eyes on the Princeſs of <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>, but

<mw rend="align(left)" type="pageNum">166</mw>
<lb/>portant Thought. The horrid Gloom,
<lb/>which ſtill ſat on his Brow, encreaſed the
<lb/>Apprehenſions of his fair Companion;
<lb/>and tho' at firſt ſhe was glad to find her­
<lb/>ſelf once more on <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName>, yet when ſhe
<lb/>look'd round and ſaw no Proſpect of
<lb/>Relief from the Force he was at liberty
<lb/>to uſe her with, ſhe fell into a kind of in­
<lb/>ward Agony, which no Words are able
<lb/>to deſcribe. His Meditations at preſent
<lb/>were however employed on very diffe­
<lb/>rent Subjects from that her Fears ſug­
<lb/>geſted: his amorous Inclinations receded
<lb/>to thoſe of his Ambition and Revenge.
<lb/>――The Recovery of his loſt State, and
<lb/>turning the Miſchief intended againſt him
<lb/>on the Heads of his Enemies, were the
<lb/>Deſigns he was now forming; and when
<lb/>he had brought them, as he imagined, to
<lb/>ſome Maturity, <said xml:id="sp188">Princeſs</said>,
	  ſaid<choice><sic>,</sic><corr/></choice> he, <said xml:id="sp189">I will

<lb/>Whether <persName>Eovaai</persName> really gave any Credit
<lb/>or not to the Promiſe he made her of re­
<lb/>gulating his Conduct, it certainly be­
<lb/>hoved her, in the preſent Situation, to
<lb/>ſeem as if ſhe did; and rejoiced to find
<lb/>that there was a Neceſſity at leaſt for his

<lb/>have on her, anſwered him in terms which
<lb/>gave him no reaſon to apprehend either

<lb/>ſurrounded my Palace, broke down the

<lb/>of that Stateſman, who, knowing what

        <p><hi>Early</hi> the next Morning, he ſent

<lb/>look on his Deſires of ſetting her on her
<lb/>Throne, before his own Re-eſtabliſhment,
<lb/>as the higheſt Teſtimony of an unfeign'd
<lb/>Affection and Reſpect. She imagined
<lb/>indeed, that he was not without ſome
<lb/>intereſted Deſigns, both on her Perſon
<lb/>and Kingdom; but then ſhe thought ſhe
<lb/>ſhould be much more ſecure from any

<lb/>She thought it therefore much better to

        <p><hi>Here</hi> followed a long Debate:
<lb/><persName>Eovaai</persName> could not think of being naked,

<lb/>one thing off, and then another; <persName>Ochi­
<lb/>hatou</persName> urging her all the time to be more
<lb/>ſpeedy, by crying out, <said xml:id="sp212">Dear Princeſs,
<lb/>the happy Moment is almoſt elaps'd.</said> At

<lb/>but the Shell, which had contain'd the

<lb/>and tho' ſhe thought it of no Value, the

        <p><hi>Having</hi> thus done what was re­

<lb/>ſpoke ſome Words altogether unintelligible
<lb/>to her, and at the ſame time ſtruck her
<lb/>on the Forehead with his magic Wand;
<lb/>on which, ſhe immediately became the
<lb/>moſt beautiful white Pigeon that ever was

        <p><hi>Full</hi> many a League thro' Air the

<lb/>Moment――tho' nothing could be more
<lb/>terrible to her than the Thoughts of ſuch
<lb/>a Transformation; tho' ſhe doubted not
<lb/>but he would really inflict it on her,
<lb/>yet ſhe reſolved to hazard every thing,
<lb/>endure every thing, rather than conſent
<lb/>to ſacrifice her Chaſtity to the Enchan­
<lb/>ter's Will. The Diſtraction of her Thoughts
<lb/>keeping her from making any Anſwer 
<lb/>to his laſt Words, he inferr'd from her
<lb/>Silence, that tho' ſhe could not bring
<lb/>herſelf to tell him ſhe would be devoted
<lb/>to him, ſhe had at leaſt given over all
<lb/>Reſiſtance; and abating ſomewhat of his
<lb/>late Auſterity, he again approach'd her,
<lb/>and taking her tenderly in his Arms, en­
<lb/>deavour'd to diſſipate her Tremblings
<lb/>with repeated Vows of making her Queen
<lb/>of <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>, as ſoon as, by having
poſſeſt
<lb/>her, he could aſſure himſelf ſhe would

ſpeaking theſe
<lb/>Words, ſhe ſeemed inſpir'd by the Power
<lb/>to whom they were addreſs'd, ſhe ſprung
<lb/>a ſecond time from the Arms of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>,
<lb/>in ſpite of his ſuperior Strength; and ſee­
<lb/>ing the dreadful Wand, the Inſtrument
<lb/>of his Miſchiefs, lying on the Graſs, ſhe
<lb/>ran to it, ſnatch'd it up, and broke it
<lb/>in ſunder before his Face. The Sudden­
<lb/>neſs with which ſhe did this Action, left
<lb/><persName>Ochihatou</persName> not the Power of preventing
<lb/>it; and he ſaw himſelf undone, before he

        <p><hi>The</hi> Moment
<persName>Eovaai</persName> had broke the

<lb/>horrible repeated after him. What other wiſe
<lb/>indeed could be expected from him? He had
	  <lb/>renounced <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Heaven</placeName> and all the Powers of 
<lb/>Goodneſs: his Crimes had render'd him
	  <lb/>deteſtable to <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Earth</placeName>; and the <name>Ypres</name>, who
<lb/>for his Ruin had become his Servants,
<lb/>now deſerted him; the magick Wand
<lb/>broken, his Spells no longer were of
<lb/>uſe; and all his Skill in Necromancy but
<lb/>made him know how much accurſed he
<lb/>was. He who ſo lately could command
<lb/>the Elements, convert the Moon to
<lb/>Blood, and even annoy the Celeſtial <name>Ge­

<lb/>with. <persName>Eovaai</persName>, of all created Beings,
<lb/>ſeemed only in his power, and on her he
<lb/>reſolved to inflict all the Torments he
<lb/>was able. That poor Princeſs had hoped
<lb/>to conceal herſelf from his Fury in a
<lb/>little Thicket; but he preſently diſcover'd,
<lb/>and dragg'd her forth, then tied her up
<lb/>by her delicate Hair on one of the Boughs
<lb/>of a ſpreading Tree, where, as ſhe was
<lb/>hanging, he got Bundles of ſtinging Net­
<lb/>tles, and ſharp-pointed Thorns, with
<lb/>which he intended to ſcourge and tear
<lb/>her tender Fleſh, till Death ſhould eaſe
<lb/>her Anguiſh: but even of this Miſchief,

<lb/>was ſtretch'd for beginning the Execution
<lb/>of his barbarous Purpoſe, a young Man,
<lb/>richly habited, and of a moſt majeſtic
<lb/>Form, ruſh'd forth from the inner Part

<lb/>was ſurprized at the nervous Gripe, but

<lb/>of my own and Country's Wrongs.</said> As
<lb/>he ſpoke this, he haſtily plucked off a
<lb/>Gold and Crimſon Belt, with which he
<lb/>was girded, and bound the vainly ſtrug­

<lb/>was ſpeaking, he gently untwiſted her

<lb/>his Shoulders an azure-colour'd Robe em­

<lb/>the bluſhing Charmer. The firſt Uſe ſhe

<lb/>her to riſe, received ſuch Teſtimonies of
<lb/>her Gratitude, as made him ſee it was a

<lb/>had the good Fortune to preſerve.</p>
        <p>Many Compliments had not paſs'd be­

<lb/>Nobility, who expreſs'd the extremeſt Joy
<lb/>at ſeeing the gallant Stranger ſafe, hav­
<lb/>ing been ſeparated from him in the late

<lb/>that <persName>Eovaai</persName>, who very well knew them, and
<lb/>their Quality, was at a loſs to gueſs of
<lb/>what Rank he muſt be, to whom they
<lb/>paid ſuch Homage. Being unwilling to
<lb/>reveal herſelf till more aſcertained how
<lb/>Affairs went in <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>, ſhe drew part of
<lb/>the Robe over her Face, while her Pro­
<lb/>tector was informing the Company in
<lb/>what manner he found her. The Rela­
<lb/>tion of this Adventure made every one
<lb/>turn with Eyes of Horror on <persName>Ochihatou</persName>,
<lb/>whoſe Character in the World yet they
<lb/>knew not, nor did the Deliverer of <persName>Eo­
<lb/>vaai</persName> acquaint them; contenting himſelf
<lb/>with ſaying, he would hereafter divulge
<lb/>a Secret concerning himſelf, as well as
<lb/>that Captive Villain, which would amaze
<lb/>them all. He then gave Orders, that he
<lb/>ſhould be tied with Cords to a Horſe's
<lb/>Tail, and in that manner dragg'd to
<lb/>Priſon, till he had conſider'd of his Ex­
<lb/>ecution.</p>
        <p><hi>But</hi> the unavailing Rage of
<persName>Ochi­
<lb/>hatou</persName> being now converted into the moſt
<lb/>horrible Deſpair, he no ſooner found him­
<lb/>ſelf looſed from the Tree, than before the
<lb/><name>Ijaveons</name> could faſten the Cords about him,
<lb/>in order to carry him, as they were
<lb/>commanded, he broke from the Hands
<lb/>which held him, and running furiouſly

<lb/>againſt a knotted Oak, daſh'd out his

        <p><hi>Thus</hi> ended the Life of this per­

<lb/><persName>Eovaai</persName>, who could not think herſelf ſafe
<lb/>while he was yet in Being; but her De­

<lb/>little Uneaſineſs, that he had thus eſcaped
<lb/>the Puniſhment of his Crimes, for the

<lb/>unequal. He ſeemed however entirely
	  <lb/>ſubmitted to the Will of <placeName rend="slant(upright)">Heaven</placeName>, and
<lb/>having commanded that the Chariots,
<lb/>which attended them, ſhould be drawn

        <p><hi>This</hi> Diſcourſe, meant for a

<lb/>Heart of <persName>Eovaai</persName>; it ſeem'd to confirm
<lb/>what ſhe before believed, that he was
<lb/>King of <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>; but ſhe made no ſhew
<lb/>of Diſcontent, and when they arrived at
<lb/>her own Palace, where he bid her wel­
<lb/>come with the utmoſt Gallantry and Po­
<lb/>liteneſs, ſcarce could ſhe refrain from
<lb/>burſting into Tears; and finding herſelf
<lb/>unable to return his Civilities in the man­
<lb/>ner ſhe fancied he would expect, pretended
<lb/>a ſudden Illneſs came over her Spi­

<lb/>bed.</p>
        <p><hi>The</hi> late Fatigue and Terror he was
<lb/>Witneſs ſhe had endured, made this Re­
<lb/>queſt not ſeem ſtrange to him. Women-
<lb/>Attendants were therefore immediately
<lb/>called, and ſhe was by them uſhered into
<lb/>a very rich Apartment, where ſhe had
<lb/>enough to exerciſe her utmoſt Wit to
<lb/>keep herſelf from their Knowledge. She
<lb/>was obliged to feign a Weakneſs in her
<lb/>Eyes, which would not bear the Light,
<lb/>to make them darken the Rooms ſo far
<lb/>as not to render her Features diſcover­
<lb/>able; and as they all of them had waited

<lb/>than ſhe was compell'd to do, and that in

        <p><hi>Being</hi> left to her Repoſe, a

<lb/>Thought againſt the Invader of her Right,
<lb/>without being guilty of Ingratitude to

<lb/>of Perplexity.――She knew not what
<lb/>ſhe ought to do; but found too well for
<lb/>her Peace of Mind what ſhe muſt do:――
<lb/>She felt ſhe loved, and loved to that de­
<lb/>gree, that to live without him would be a
<lb/>Miſery greater than in all her Sufferings
<lb/>ſhe had ever before had any notion of.
<lb/>The firſt moment ſhe beheld him, ſhe
<lb/>wiſhed he might be of a Rank that might
<lb/>not diſgrace her Choice in making him
<lb/>King of <placeName>Ijaveo</placeName>; but as ſhe now believed
<lb/>him already ſo, the Pride of Blood and
<lb/>conſcious Title made her diſdain the
<lb/>Thought of reigning with him, if even,
<lb/>to ſanctify his Claim, he ſhould make
<lb/>her that Offer, when who ſhe was ſhould

        <p><hi>The</hi> various Agitations of her

<lb/>had they known her for <persName>Eovaai</persName>; but
<lb/>ſhe continuing reſolute to conceal herſelf
<lb/>for a while, refuſed to riſe, and deſired
<lb/>they would leave the Chamber. When

<lb/>at length appear'd, and ſhe calling her

<lb/>Preſerver of her whole People alſo, to

<lb/>Impatient now to ſee him, ſhe immediate­

<lb/>had only time to command <persName>Emoe</persName>, as ſhe

        <p><hi>The</hi> Meeting of this illuſtrious Pair
<lb/>had ſomething in it very peculiar: They

<lb/>traordinary Emotions which hurried thro'
<lb/>their Souls, (as they afterwards confeſs'd)
<lb/>kept both in a profound Silence. At

<lb/>in ſuch a Perplexity of Mind, as may
<lb/>more eaſily be conceived than repreſented;
<lb/>it ſeem'd extremely ſtrange to her, that
<lb/>he ſhould abandon a People by whom he
<lb/>was ſo much eſteem'd, and who had given
<lb/>into his hands the ſole Reins of Power;
<lb/>eſpecially when ſhe remembred, that the
<lb/>Day before he ſeemed to be far from hav­
<lb/>ing any ſuch Deſign; this ſudden Reſo­
<lb/>lution ſhe therefore thought muſt proceed
<lb/>from as ſudden an Excitement; ―― ſhe
<lb/>found he was not married, and the Eyes
<lb/>with which he had regarded her both at
<lb/>the time of his delivering her from the
<lb/>Rage of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, and in this Mor­
<lb/>ning's Viſit, made her think it not impoſ­
<lb/>ſible he might have found ſomething in
<lb/>her worthy of the moſt violent Paſſion;
<lb/>and that imagining ſhe was not of a Birth
<lb/>which might juſtify his Choice, he had
<lb/>no other way of expelling her Idea, but
<lb/>by Abſence. She was the more confirm'd
<lb/>in this Opinion, when <persName>Emoe</persName>, who returned
<lb/>as ſoon as he was gone, told her he had
<lb/>never been obſerved to treat any Lady of

<lb/>many Days, before <persName>Hoban</persName>, for ſo he was

<lb/>quainted me with the whole black Deſign

<lb/>It was therefore agreed between us, that I

<lb/>is really <persName>Adelhu</persName>, into that of
<persName>Ihoya</persName>, by
<lb/>long and painful Journeys I at laſt arrived
<lb/>in the Kingdom of <placeName>Narzada</placeName>, juſt at the
<lb/>time when <persName>Hyalard</persName> was about to ſet out
<lb/>on an Expedition againſt the Provinces of
<lb/><placeName>Tacty</placeName> and <placeName>Benla</placeName>. The
natural Propenſity
<lb/>I ever had to martial Exploits, induced
<lb/>me to liſt my ſelf under the Banners of
<lb/>this young Prince: Our Arms obtain'd a
<lb/>Conqueſt, indeed, but too eaſily; for moſt
<lb/>of the Cities and great Towns, having, as
<lb/>they imagin'd, been ſeverely dealt with
<lb/>by their former Sovereigns, ſurrendered
<lb/>themſelves gladly to one who promiſed
<lb/>them many Liberties and Immunities they
<lb/>before had been debarred from: but they
<lb/>ſoon found, that where a People conſents
<lb/>to a Change of Government, for the ſake
<lb/>of Freedom, the Perſon to whom they
<lb/>ſubmit takes but the more care to rivet
<lb/>their Chains the faſter. <persName>Hyalard</persName> had been
<lb/>educated in the Principles of arbitrary
<lb/>Sway, and no ſooner was made a King,
<lb/>than he began to exerciſe his Authority
<lb/>in the ſame manner his Father did in <placeName>Nar­
<lb/>zada</placeName>. Nothing now was to be ſeen but
<lb/>Pride, Luxury and Oppreſſion among the

<lb/>made me grow weary of that Court.――
<lb/>I took my leave of the new King, and
<lb/>travelled into <placeName>Habull</placeName>, where I was yet
<lb/>more mortified; <persName>Oudeſcar</persName>, the King
<lb/>thereof, had been compelled to make
<lb/>Peace with the <name>Fayolians</name>, very much to
<lb/>his Prejudice, merely on the account that
<lb/><placeName>Hypotofa</placeName>, his ancient Ally, had ſeen
his
<lb/>Provinces laid waſte, his Armies routed,
<lb/>and himſelf diſtreſs'd beyond meaſure;
<lb/>yet, ſent no Forces to his Aid, nor ſeem'd
<lb/>any otherwiſe concern'd, than to offer
<lb/>a fruitleſs Mediation. I every day heard
<lb/>my Royal Father ſpoken of, in Terms
<lb/>which ſtabb'd me to the Heart.—They
<lb/>ſaid he was in his Dotage, a ſecond time
<lb/>a Child, and under the Tutorage of
<lb/>one of the meaneſt Wretches in the
<lb/>Kingdom, meaning <persName>Ochihatou</persName>; that
<lb/>there was neither Honour, Wiſdom,
<lb/>Faith nor Courage, left in <placeName>Hypotofa</placeName>, and
<lb/>ſeemed to hint, that, at a proper time,
<lb/>the Affront offered to <placeName>Habull</placeName> ſhould be
<lb/>returned with Intereſt. Unable to ſup­
<lb/>port this Inſolence, and far from a Con­
<lb/>dition to reſent it as I ought, I went to
<lb/><placeName>Fayoul</placeName>; not doubting but I ſhould
<emph>there</emph>
<lb/>hear only Praiſes of the Moderation ob­
<lb/>ſerved by <persName>Oeros</persName> in this nice Conjuncture:
<lb/>but, on the contrary, they only laugh'd

<lb/>with his moſt cruel Enemies to invade
<lb/><placeName>Hypotofa</placeName>, which by the Degeneracy of

<lb/>Conqueſt. I wrote ſeveral Letters, as

<lb/>diſcovered, to ſome whom I knew were
<lb/>ſtill ſollicitous for their Country's Wel­
<lb/>fare, but fear they were intercepted by
<lb/>the Vigilance of <persName>Ochihatou</persName>, who was more
