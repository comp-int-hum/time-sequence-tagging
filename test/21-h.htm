      The Wolf And The Lamb
    </h2>
    <p>
      WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay
      violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the
      Wolf&rsquo;s right to eat him. He thus addressed him: &ldquo;Sirrah, last year you
      grossly insulted me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of
      voice, &ldquo;I was not then born.&rdquo; Then said the Wolf, &ldquo;You feed in my
      pasture.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, good sir,&rdquo; replied the Lamb, &ldquo;I have not yet tasted grass.&rdquo;
       Again said the Wolf, &ldquo;You drink of my well.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; exclaimed the Lamb, &ldquo;I
      never yet drank water, for as yet my mother&rsquo;s milk is both food and drink
      to me.&rdquo; Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, &ldquo;Well! I
      won&rsquo;t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my
      imputations.&rdquo; The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

      The Bat And The Weasels
    </h2>
    <p>
      A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be
      spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the
      enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a
      mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the
      ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to
      eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat
      assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time
      escaped.

      AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and,
      desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food
      they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied, &ldquo;The dew.&rdquo;
       The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time
      died of hunger.

      repay your kindness.&rdquo; The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly
      after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by
      strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and
      gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting
      to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is
      possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.&rdquo;

      A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met a
      friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that
      they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses
      would be lessened. The Fuller replied, &ldquo;The arrangement is impossible as

    <p>
      A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among
      themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he
      determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion;
      and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks.
      When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them
      in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all
      their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot,
      took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons&rsquo;
      hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these
      words: &ldquo;My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other,
      you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies;
      but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as
      these sticks.&rdquo;

      could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general
      assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a
      universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid,
      the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in
      perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, &ldquo;Oh, how I have longed to see this
      day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of
      the strong.&rdquo; And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.

      Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that

      his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain,
      he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an
      excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the
      rock he said: &ldquo;O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not
      dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.&rdquo;

      A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.
      After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only
      discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in
      sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not long
      afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion
      feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his
      hands to heaven, and said: &ldquo;Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the
      Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me;
      but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a
      full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own

      A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food
      by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and lying
      down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness should be
      publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to
      his den, where the Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus
      disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the
      Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance, and
      asked him how he was. &ldquo;I am very middling,&rdquo; replied the Lion, &ldquo;but why do
      you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo;
       said the Fox. &ldquo;I notice that there are many prints of feet entering your
      cave, but I see no trace of any returning.&rdquo;

    <p>
      A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was
      left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other
      Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his
      master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing
      him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do
      in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens
      from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with
      the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his
      cords and halter, and galloped into his master&rsquo;s house, kicking up his
      heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He
      next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he
      broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then
      attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The servants,
      hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master,
      quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and
      clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to
      death, thus lamented: &ldquo;I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not
      have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle
      all the day like that useless little Lapdog!&rdquo;

    <p>
      A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. Thereafter,
      feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was
      exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless
      was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation. He
      assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their
      tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but
      that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great
      inconvenience. One of them interrupting him said, &ldquo;If you had not yourself
      lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us.&rdquo;

      A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women at
      the same time. One of them was young, and the other well advanced in
      years. The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than
      herself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out some
      portion of his black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not wishing to
      become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray
      hair she could find. Thus it came to pass that between them both he very
      soon found that he had not a hair left on his head.

    <p>
      AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to
      heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses:
      that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of
      money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing. This
      agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to
      her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her
      property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he healed her
      and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman, when she recovered her
      sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give him nothing. The
      Physician insisted on his claim, and, as she still refused, summoned her
      before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: &ldquo;This
      man here speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a
      sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued blind, I was
      to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed. I on the contrary
      affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in
      my house various chattels and valuable goods: but now, though he swears I
      am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.&rdquo;

      him. He next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and she again

      of still greater value. At last he was caught in the very act, and having
      his hands bound behind him, was led away to the place of public execution.
      His Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in sorrow,
      whereupon the young man said, &ldquo;I wish to say something to my Mother in her
      ear.&rdquo; She came close to him, and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth
      and bit it off. The Mother upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he
      replied, &ldquo;Ah! if you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you
      that lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus led
      to a disgraceful death.&rdquo;

      A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an

      water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse
      tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his
      friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their
      food. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived,
      until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the Mouse
      with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about,
      as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by
      the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the
      foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his
      talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the
      Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.

      your life is still in peril.&rdquo; At that moment the master himself entered,

      A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the Sea very
      calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view to commerce. He
      sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of dates, and set sail. But a
      very great tempest came on, and the ship being in danger of sinking, he
      threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely escaped with his life in
      the empty ship. Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed
      the unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, &ldquo;It is again
      in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet.&rdquo;

      AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion, desperate

      when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice the Lion, it is said, has a

      could. The Ass, observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock
      summoned courage to attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose.
      He had run no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and
      tore him to pieces.

    </h2>
    <p>
      THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in which
      much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The Mice thought
      that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set
      apart from the general army to command them, and that they were exposed to
      dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that
      were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as
      well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they
      might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops,
      regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army
      disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging
      the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that
      they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the
      battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as
      fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able to get in
      on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by
      the Weasels.

      nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead
      of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought
      with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle thus came to an end
      amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.

      resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design, she
      climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, &ldquo;Destruction is preparing for

      digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall
      seize our families as food for her young.&rdquo; Having thus frightened the
      Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said,
      &ldquo;Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you go out with your
      litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your
      little pigs.&rdquo; Having instilled these fears into the Sow, she went and
      pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree. When night came she
      went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens,
      but feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day.
      Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches,
      and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave.
      And thus they both, along with their families, perished from hunger, and
      afforded ample provision for the Cat and her kittens.

      handsome coat and sitting before his door. The Thief sat down beside him

      do you howl so fearfully?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said the Thief, &ldquo;but first
      let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces. I know
      not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of
      howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any other
      cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually
      turn into a wolf and attack men.&rdquo; With this speech he commenced a second
      fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. The
      Innkeeper, hearing his tale and believing what he said, became greatly
      alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. The Thief laid
      hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, &ldquo;Pray wait, sir, and
      hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn
      into a wolf.&rdquo; At the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a
      terrible howl. The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left
      his new coat in the Thief&rsquo;s hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn
      for safety. The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to

      abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own table. Grateful
      for these favors, the animals determined to repay him to the best of their
      ability. For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them,
      and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly
      characterized himself. The Horse chose his earliest years and gave them
      his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth impetuous, headstrong,
      and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion. The Ox took under his
      patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is
      fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to
      husband his resources. The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore
      the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,
      tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who
      do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.

      The Apes and the Two Travelers
    </h2>
    <p>
      TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing but
      lies, were traveling together and by chance came to the land of Apes. One
      of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded them to be
      seized and brought before him, that he might know what was said of him
      among men. He ordered at the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a
      long row on his right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed
      for him, as was the custom among men. After these preparations he
      signified that the two men should be brought before him, and greeted them
      with this salutation: &ldquo;What sort of a king do I seem to you to be, O
      strangers?&rdquo; The Lying Traveler replied, &ldquo;You seem to me a most mighty
      king.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what is your estimate of those you see around me?&rdquo; &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he
      made answer, &ldquo;are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be
      ambassadors and leaders of armies.&rdquo; The Ape and all his court, gratified
      with the lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer.
      On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, &ldquo;If so great a reward be
      given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my
      custom, I tell the truth?&rdquo; The Ape quickly turned to him. &ldquo;And pray how do
      I and these my friends around me seem to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou art,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
      most excellent Ape, and all these thy companions after thy example are
      excellent Apes too.&rdquo; The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these
      truths, gave him over to the teeth and claws of his companions.

      The Wolf and the Shepherd
    </h2>
    <p>
      A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to
      injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him,
      as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements. But when
      the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and did not make
      the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as
      a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and
      when occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely
      in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the
      sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the Shepherd
      returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: &ldquo;I have been rightly
      served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?&rdquo;

      ripeness. He said, &ldquo;I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with
      as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.&rdquo; The Lark on

      SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them to be very
      heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a large
      catch. When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but few
      fish: the nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were beyond
      measure cast down so much at the disappointment which had befallen them,
      but because they had formed such very different expectations. One of their

      be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced, should next have

      than the wings of the Birds themselves. The Birds gave no credence to
      these warning words, but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said
      that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words were true, they
      wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds. Hence
      it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things, while
      she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.

    <p>
      ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share
      which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason of
      their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted
      themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their
      persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be
      associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could not live
      together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble
      law might be laid down for their future protection. Jupiter granted their
      request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in
      company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one enter the
      habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound, for they come not
      one by one, but in troops, and by no means singly: while the Goods proceed
      from Jupiter, and are given, not alike to all, but singly, and separately;
      and one by one to those who are able to discern them.

      ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by Jupiter, the

      of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect
      work. They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision.
      Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault
      with all. He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the
      horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike.
      He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart
      of man on the outside, that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil
      disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief. And, lastly,
      he inveighed against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in
      the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove
      if a neighbor proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate
      faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from
      the mansions of Olympus.

      the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young. Not long
      after they had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being in want of
      provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was out, seized
      upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her brood. The Fox on
      her return, discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the
      death of her young than for her inability to avenge them. A just
      retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While hovering near an
      altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat, she suddenly
      seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a burning cinder,
      to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame, and the
      eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted in their nest and
      dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the
      Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up.

      by a stratagem. &ldquo;Since I cannot sleep,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;on account of your song
      which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself
      in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me. If you do not dislike
      it, come to me and we will drink it together.&rdquo; The Grasshopper, who was
      thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly flew up. The
      Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death.

      The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that
      sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten
      his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a
      second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the
      tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw
      down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.

      The Buffoon and the Countryman
    </h2>
    <p>
      A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and
      gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who
      invented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers
      contended for the prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the
      populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment which
      had never been brought out on any stage before. This report being spread
      about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. The
      Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus or
      confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence.
      He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of
      a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had
      a porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When
      that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded
      him with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd, observing all
      that has passed, said, &ldquo;So help me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that
      trick!&rdquo; and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next
      day, though in a much more natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd
      assembled in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very
      generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the
      Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers appeared on
      the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as
      on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. Next the
      Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig
      beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the
      audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig
      to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the Buffoon
      had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to
      be kicked out of the theater. On this the rustic produced the little pig
      from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the greatness of
      their mistake. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this shows what sort of judges you
      are.&rdquo;

      Bramble to save himself. Having pricked and grievously torn the soles of
      his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her for
      assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself. The Bramble,
      interrupting him, said, &ldquo;But you really must have been out of your senses
      to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon
      others.&rdquo;

      The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain the

      AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in
      company with a Kite. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Kite, &ldquo;do I see you with such a
      rueful look?&rdquo; &ldquo;I seek,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;a mate suitable for me, and am not
      able to find one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; returned the Kite, &ldquo;I am much stronger than
      you are.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your
      plunder?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my
      talons.&rdquo; The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate.
      Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, &ldquo;Fly off and bring me back the
      ostrich you promised me.&rdquo; The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought
      back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it had
      lain about the fields. &ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; said the Eagle, &ldquo;the faithful
      fulfillment of your promise to me?&rdquo; The Kite replied, &ldquo;That I might attain
      your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however
      much I knew that I must fail in the performance.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      LIFE OF AESOP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Life and History of Æsop is involved, like that of Homer, the most
      famous of Greek poets, in much obscurity. Sardis, the capital of Lydia;
      Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient colony in Thrace; and
      Cotiaeum, the chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend for the
      distinction of being the birthplace of Aesop. Although the honor thus
      claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet
      there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as
      established facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. He is,
      by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the year
      620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave. He was owned by two masters
      in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon, the latter
      of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning and wit. One of
      the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of Greece, was the
      permission to take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, like
      the philosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times, raised
      himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a position of high
      renown. In his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed, he travelled
      through many countries, and among others came to Sardis, the capital of
      the famous king of Lydia, the great patron, in that day, of learning and
      of learned men. He met at the court of Croesus with Solon, Thales, and
      other sages, and is related so to have pleased his royal master, by the
      part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers, that he
      applied to him an expression which has since passed into a proverb,
      &ldquo;&#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#8001;
      &#934;&#961;&#8059;&#958;.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Phrygian has spoken better
      than all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was
      employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of
      State. In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different
      petty republics of Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth, and at
      another in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his wise
      fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the administration
      of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus. One of these
      ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus, was the
      occasion of his death. Having been sent to Delphi with a large sum of gold
      for distribution among the citizens, he was so provoked at their
      covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and sent it back to his
      master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment, accused him of impiety,
      and, in spite of his sacred character as ambassador, executed him as a
      public criminal. This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged. The citizens
      of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities, until they made a
      public reparation of their crime; and, &ldquo;The blood of Aesop&rdquo; became a
      well-known adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong would
      not pass unpunished. Neither did the great fabulist lack posthumous
      honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at Athens, the work of
      Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek sculptors. Phaedrus thus
      immortalizes the event:
    </p>

<p class="poem">
     Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici,<br />
     Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi:<br />
     Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam;<br />
     Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.
</p>
    <p>
      These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of
      certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. They were
      first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent perusal of
      ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard Bachet de Mezeriac, who
      declined the honor of being tutor to Louis XIII of France, from his desire
      to devote himself exclusively to literature. He published his Life of
      Aesop, Anno Domini 1632. The later investigations of a host of English and
      German scholars have added very little to the facts given by M. Mezeriac.
      The substantial truth of his statements has been confirmed by later
      criticism and inquiry. It remains to state, that prior to this publication
      of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop was from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a
      monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an embassy to Venice by the
      Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who wrote in the early part of
      the fourteenth century. His life was prefixed to all the early editions of
      these fables, and was republished as late as 1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as
      the introduction to his edition of Aesop. This life by Planudes contains,
      however, so small an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of
      the grotesque deformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying
      legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally condemned as
      false, puerile, and unauthentic.<a href="#linknote-101"
       name="linknoteref-101" id="linknoteref-101"><small> 101</small></a> It is
      given up in the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the
      slightest credit. G.F.T.

    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular modes of
      conveying instruction. Each is distinguished by its own special
      characteristics. The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story
      either founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and not
      necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson. The Parable
      is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey a hidden and
      secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and
      which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer, or reader.
      The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from both of these. It
      will contain, like the Tale, a short but real narrative; it will seek,
      like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning, and that not so much by the
      use of language, as by the skilful introduction of fictitious characters;
      and yet unlike to either Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as
      its high prerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of
      instruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim,
      social duty, or political truth. The true Fable, if it rise to its high
      requirements, ever aims at one great end and purpose representation of
      human motive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals
      its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with
      speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the
      wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice
      without perceiving the presence of the adviser. Thus the superiority of
      the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of
      view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader is
      led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf
      of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation
      excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy. The true fabulist,
      therefore, discharges a most important function. He is neither a narrator,
      nor an allegorist. He is a great teacher, a corrector of morals, a censor
      of vice, and a commender of virtue. In this consists the superiority of
      the Fable over the Tale or the Parable. The fabulist is to create a laugh,
      but yet, under a merry guise, to convey instruction. Phaedrus, the great
      imitator of Aesop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true
      office of the writer of fables.
    </p>

<p class="poem">
     Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet,<br />
     Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.
</p>
    <p>
      The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and
      accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. &ldquo;The fable,&rdquo;
       says Professor K. O. Mueller, &ldquo;originated in Greece in an intentional
      travestie of human affairs. The &lsquo;ainos,&rsquo; as its name denotes, is an
      admonition, or rather a reproof veiled, either from fear of an excess of
      frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an
      occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and
      authentic account of the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same."<a
      href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><small> 1</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1) the
      narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a careful
      maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious personages
      introduced into it. The narration should relate to one simple action,
      consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a multiplicity of
      details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances. The moral or lesson
      should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven with, and so necessarily
      dependent on, the narration, that every reader should be compelled to give
      to it the same undeniable interpretation. The introduction of the animals
      or fictitious characters should be marked with an unexceptionable care and
      attention to their natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to
      them by universal popular consent. The Fox should be always cunning, the
      Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse
      proud, and the Ass patient. Many of these fables are characterized by the
      strictest observance of these rules. They are occupied with one short
      narrative, from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is
      intimately associated. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the simple manner,&rdquo; says Dodsley,<a
      href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small> 2</small></a>
      &ldquo;in which the morals of Aesop are interwoven with his fables that
      distinguishes him, and gives him the preference over all other
      mythologists. His &lsquo;Mountain delivered of a Mouse,&rsquo; produces the moral of
      his fable in ridicule of pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops
      her cheese, lets fall, as it were by accident, the strongest admonition
      against the power of flattery. There is no need of a separate sentence to
      explain it; no possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too
      often see of accumulated reflections."<a href="#linknote-3"
       name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small> 3</small></a> An equal
      amount of praise is due for the consistency with which the characters of
      the animals, fictitiously introduced, are marked. While they are made to
      depict the motives and passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree,
      their own special features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage,
      of generosity or rapacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all the
      fables in this collection. Many of them lack that unity of design, that
      close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice in the
      introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and excellency of
      true Aesopian fable. This inferiority of some to others is sufficiently
      accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of these fables.
      The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of Aesop. Many are
      obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he lived. Thus,
      the fable of the &ldquo;Hawk and the Nightingale&rdquo; is related by Hesiod;<a
      href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small> 4</small></a>
      the &ldquo;Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own Feathers,&rdquo; by
      Aeschylus;<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>
      5</small></a> the &ldquo;Fox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,&rdquo; by Archilochus.<a
      href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small> 6</small></a>
      Many of them again are of later origin, and are to be traced to the monks
      of the middle ages: and yet this collection, though thus made up of fables
      both earlier and later than the era of Aesop, rightfully bears his name,
      because he composed so large a number (all framed in the same mould, and
      conformed to the same fashion, and stamped with the same lineaments,
      image, and superscription) as to secure to himself the right to be
      considered the father of Greek fables, and the founder of this class of
      writing, which has ever since borne his name, and has secured for him,
      through all succeeding ages, the position of the first of moralists.<a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small> 7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and for a long
time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition. Socrates is
mentioned by Plato<a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small> 8</small></a>
as having employed his time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacred
ship from Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning some of
these fables into verse, but he thus versified only such as he remembered.
Demetrius Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to have
made the first collection of these fables. Phaedrus, a slave by birth or by
subsequent misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a freedman,
imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the commencement of the
Christian era. Aphthonius, a rhetorician of Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatise
on, and converted into Latin prose, some of these fables. This translation is
the more worthy of notice, as it illustrates a custom of common use, both in
these and in later times. The rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed to
give the Fables of Aesop as an exercise to their scholars, not only inviting
them to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practice and to perfect
themselves thereby in style and rules of grammar, by making for themselves new
and various versions of the fables. Ausonius,<a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small> 9</small></a>
the friend of the Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in the
Western Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse, which Julianus
Titianus, a contemporary writer of no great name, translated into prose.
Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius, put some of these fables into Latin
elegiacs, which are given by Nevelet (in a book we shall refer to hereafter),
and are occasionally incorporated with the editions of Phaedrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables of
      Aesop. During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an
      eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at the
      commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors were
      the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an Asiatic
      court, that we next find honors paid to the name and memory of Aesop.
      Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a collection of
      about a hundred and fifty of these fables. Little is known of his history.
      Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in his monastery. He took
      an active part in public affairs. In 1327 A.D. he was sent on a diplomatic
      mission to Venice by the Emperor Andronicus the Elder. This brought him
      into immediate contact with the Western Patriarch, whose interests he
      henceforth advocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and
      persecution from the rulers of the Eastern Church. Planudes has been
      exposed to a two-fold accusation. He is charged on the one hand with
      having had before him a copy of Babrias (to whom we shall have occasion to
      refer at greater length in the end of this Preface), and to have had the
      bad taste &ldquo;to transpose,&rdquo; or to turn his poetical version into prose: and
      he is asserted, on the other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Aesop
      at all, but to have himself invented and made the fables which he palmed
      off under the name of the famous Greek fabulist. The truth lies between
      these two extremes. Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have
      inserted some that were current in his day; but there is an abundance of
      unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with
      the veritable fables of Aesop, although the versions he had access to were
      probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and
      disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers. His
      collection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source or
      foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the direct
      channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop to their
      high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked for
      in the West rather than in the East. The calamities gradually thickening
      round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D.
      combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning in
      Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest in
      the Fables of Aesop is closely identified. These fables, indeed, were
      among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted attention.
      They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and the ancient classic
      authors, in the minds of the great students of that day. Lorenzo Valla,
      one of the most famous promoters of Italian learning, not only translated
      into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the Histories of Herodotus and
      Thucydides, but also the Fables of Aesop.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended
      circulation by the agency of the printing press. Bonus Accursius, as early
      as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by Planudes,
      which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into English, and
      printed at his press in West-minster Abbey, 1485.<a href="#linknote-10"
       name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small> 10</small></a> It must
      be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent traces
      of its influence on these fables,<a href="#linknote-11"
       name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small> 11</small></a> by
      causing the interpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which
      were so frequently introduced into the public discourses of the great
      preachers of those days, and of which specimens are yet to be found in the
      extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette.<a
      href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><small> 12</small></a>
      The publication of this era which most probably has influenced these
      fables, is the &ldquo;Liber Facetiarum,"<a href="#linknote-13"
       name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13"><small> 13</small></a> a book
      consisting of a hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio
      Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from which the two fables of the
      &ldquo;Miller, his Son, and the Ass,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fox and the Woodcutter,&rdquo; are
      undoubtedly selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany, and
      their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to them by
      the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them as vehicles
      for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the Romish
      ecclesiastics. The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an active
      part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found time, amidst
      his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the students in the
      university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor. Martin Luther
      translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by Melancthon to complete
      the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the celebrated Lutheran theologian, and
      librarian to Frederick I, king of Prussia, mentions that the great
      Reformer valued the Fables of Aesop next after the Holy Scriptures. In
      1546 A.D. the second printed edition of the collection of the Fables made
      by Planudes, was issued from the printing-press of Robert Stephens, in
      which were inserted some additional fables from a MS. in the Bibliotheque
      du Roy at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables of
      Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the early
      part of the seventeenth century. In the year 1610, a learned Swiss, Isaac
      Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of these fables, in
      a work entitled &ldquo;Mythologia Aesopica.&rdquo; This was a noble effort to do honor
      to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect collection of Aesopian
      fables ever yet published. It consisted, in addition to the collection of
      fables given by Planudes and reprinted in the various earlier editions, of
      one hundred and thirty-six new fables (never before published) from MSS.
      in the Library of the Vatican, of forty fables attributed to Aphthonius,
      and of forty-three from Babrias. It also contained the Latin versions of
      the same fables by Phaedrus, Avienus, and other authors. This volume of
      Nevelet forms a complete &ldquo;Corpus Fabularum Aesopicarum;&rdquo; and to his labors
      Aesop owes his restoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists
      and great teachers of mankind. During the interval of three centuries
      which has elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet&rsquo;s, no
      book, with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider
      circulation than Aesop&rsquo;s Fables. They have been translated into the
      greater number of the languages both of Europe and of the East, and have
      been read, and will be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen,
      Mohammedan, and Christian. They are, at the present time, not only
      engrafted into the literature of the civilized world, but are familiar as
      household words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the
      inhabitants of all countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This collection of Nevelet&rsquo;s is the great culminating point in the history
      of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian Fables. It is
      remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea, which
      has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of
      circumstances. Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named Babrias
      would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of Aesopian
      Fables. This intimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries, the
      knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a full
      understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with the
      writings that bear his name.
    </p>
    <p>
The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might not unfitly
be enumerated among the curiosities of literature. He is generally supposed to
have been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the Ionic Colonies, but the exact
period in which he lived and wrote is yet unsettled. He is placed, by one
critic,<a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
as far back as the institution of the Achaian League, B.C. 250; by another as
late as the Emperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him a
contemporary with Phaedrus in the time of Augustus. At whatever time he wrote
his version of Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirely
disappeared, and to have been lost sight of. His name is mentioned by Avienus;
by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of the eleventh century, who gives
in his lexicon several isolated verses of his version of the fables; and by
John Tzetzes, a grammarian and poet of Constantinople, who lived during the
latter half of the twelfth century. Nevelet, in the preface to the volume which
we have described, points out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the work
of Aesop, as they contain a reference in two places to &ldquo;Holy
monks,&rdquo; and give a verse from the Epistle of St. James as an
&ldquo;Epimith&rdquo; to one of the fables, and suggests Babrias as their
author. Francis Vavassor,<a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
a learned French jesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, and
produced further proofs from internal evidence, from the use of the word
Piraeus in describing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not given till
two hundred years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern words,
that many of these fables must have been at least committed to writing
posterior to the time of Aesop, and more boldly suggests Babrias as their
author or collector.<a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
These various references to Babrias induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at the close
of the seventeenth century, to examine more minutely the existing versions of
Aesop&rsquo;s Fables, and he maintained that many of them could, with a slight
change of words, be resolved into the Scazonic<a href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
iambics, in which Babrias is known to have written: and, with a greater freedom
than the evidence then justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim
to the exclusive authorship of these fables. Such a seemingly extravagant
theory, thus roundly asserted, excited much opposition. Dr. Bentley<a href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
met with an able antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford, the Hon.
Mr. Charles Boyle,<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
afterwards Earl of Orrery. Their letters and disputations on this subject,
enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning, will ever bear a
conspicuous place in the literary history of the seventeenth century. The
arguments of Dr. Bentley were yet further defended a few years later by Mr.
Thomas Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions that
he might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. Mr.
Tyrwhitt published, A.D. 1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a collection of
his fables in choliambic meter found in a MS. in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford. Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian, contributed further testimony to
the correctness of the supposition that Babrias had made a veritable collection
of fables by printing from a MS. contained in the Vatican library several
fables never before published. In the year 1844, however, new and unexpected
light was thrown upon this subject. A veritable copy of Babrias was found in a
manner as singular as were the MSS. of Quinctilian&rsquo;s Institutes, and of
Cicero&rsquo;s Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St. Gall A.D. 1416. M.
Menoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction to
King Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a commission to search for ancient
MSS., and in carrying out his instructions he found a MS. at the convent of St.
Laura, on Mount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and
wished-for choliambic version of Babrias. This MS. was found to be divided into
two books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five, and the other
ninety-five fables. This discovery attracted very general attention, not only
as confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures so boldly made by a long
chain of critics, but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures tending
to establish the reputation, and to confirm the antiquity and authenticity of
the great mass of Aesopian Fable. The Fables thus recovered were soon
published. They found a most worthy editor in the late distinguished Sir George
Cornewall Lewis, and a translator equally qualified for his task, in the
Reverend James Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, and
himself a relation of their English editor. Thus, after an eclipse of many
centuries, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable collector of
veritable Aesopian Fables.

      no doubt, in the first instance, a primary and private interpretation. On
      the first occasion of their being composed they were intended to refer to
      some passing event, or to some individual acts of wrong-doing. Thus, the
      fables of the &ldquo;Eagle and the Fox&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Fox and Monkey&rdquo; are supposed
      to have been written by Archilochus, to avenge the injuries done him by
      Lycambes. So also the fables of the &ldquo;Swollen Fox&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Frogs asking
      a King&rdquo; were spoken by Aesop for the immediate purpose of reconciling the
      inhabitants of Samos and Athens to their respective rulers, Periander and
      Pisistratus; while the fable of the &ldquo;Horse and Stag&rdquo; was composed to
      caution the inhabitants of Himera against granting a bodyguard to
      Phalaris. In a similar manner, the fable from Phaedrus, the &ldquo;Marriage of
      the Sun,&rdquo; is supposed to have reference to the contemplated union of
      Livia, the daughter of Drusus, with Sejanus the favourite, and minister of
      Trajan. These fables, however, though thus originating in special events,
      and designed at first to meet special circumstances, are so admirably
      constructed as to be fraught with lessons of general utility, and of
      universal application.]

      been not entirely unknown to the mediaeval scholars. There are two
      celebrated works which might by some be classed amongst works of this
      description. The one is the &ldquo;Speculum Sapientiae,&rdquo; attributed to St.
      Cyril, Archbishop of Jerusalem, but of a considerably later origin, and
      existing only in Latin. It is divided into four books, and consists of
      long conversations conducted by fictitious characters under the figures
      the beasts of the field and forest, and aimed at the rebuke of particular
      classes of men, the boastful, the proud, the luxurious, the wrathful,
      &amp;c. None of the stories are precisely those of Aesop, and none have
      the concinnity, terseness, and unmistakable deduction of the lesson
      intended to be taught by the fable, so conspicuous in the great Greek
      fabulist. The exact title of the book is this: &ldquo;Speculum Sapientiae, B.
      Cyrilli Episcopi: alias quadripartitus apologeticus vocatus, in cujus
      quidem proverbiis omnis et totius sapientiae speculum claret et feliciter
      incipit.&rdquo; The other is a larger work in two volumes, published in the
      fourteenth century by Caesar Heisterbach, a Cistercian monk, under the
      title of &ldquo;Dialogus Miraculorum,&rdquo; reprinted in 1851. This work consists of
      conversations in which many stories are interwoven on all kinds of
      subjects. It has no correspondence with the pure Aesopian fable.]

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
