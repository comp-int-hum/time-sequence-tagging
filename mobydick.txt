Yes, these eyes are windows, and this\n      body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn\u2019t stop up the chinks and\n      the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it\u2019s\n      too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the\n      copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor\n      Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,\n      and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both\n      ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not\n      keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his\n      red silken wrapper\u2014(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What\n      a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights!

Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\n      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\n      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of\n      much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\n      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\n      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,\n      might not be altogether unwarranted.\n    ", "1": "\n      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\n      black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three\n      blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.

I then glanced\n      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no\n      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,\n      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not\n      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown\n      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman\u2019s bag, containing the\n      harpooneer\u2019s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.

I can compare it to nothing\n      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags\n      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.\n      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in\n      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer\n      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in\n      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a\n      hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as\n      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\n      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw\n      such a sight in my life.

I then took off my coat, and thought a\n      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half\n      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the\n      harpooneer\u2019s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I\n      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then\n      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care\n      of heaven.\n    ", "53": "\n      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there\n      is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a\n      long time.

But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\n      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\n      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of\n      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness\n      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in\n      unlacing the bag\u2019s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round\u2014when,\n      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,\n      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking\n      squares. Yes, it\u2019s just as I thought, he\u2019s a terrible bedfellow; he\u2019s been\n      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But\n      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I\n      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred\n      to me. I remembered a story of a white man\u2014a whaleman too\u2014who,\n      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that\n      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with\n      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s only his\n      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make\n      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\n      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it\n      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of\n      a hot sun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the\n      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\u2014a ghastly\n      thing enough\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n      hat\u2014a new beaver hat\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh\n      surprise. There was no hair on his head\u2014none to speak of at least\u2014nothing\n      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head\n      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\n      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than\n      ever I bolted a dinner.\n    ", "55": "\n      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it\n      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\n      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance\n      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded\n      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was\n      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.\n      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to\n      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed\n      inexplicable in him.\n    ", "56": "\n      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his\n      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with\n      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark\n      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years\u2019 War, and just escaped\n      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were\n      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of\n      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage\n      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in\n      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too\u2014perhaps\n      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine\u2014heavens!\n      look at that tomahawk!\n    ", "57": "\n      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\n      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\n      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\n      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a\n      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days\u2019 old Congo baby.\n      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black\n      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that\n      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished\n      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed\n      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and\n      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,\n      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n    ", "58": "\n      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill\n      at ease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top\n      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a\n      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and\n      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\n      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\n      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it\n      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry\n      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics\n      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who\n      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or\n      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,\n      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a\n      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n    ", "59": "\n      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him\n      now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and\n      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before\n      the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been\n      bound.\n    ", "60": "\n      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\n      instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\n      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was\n      extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang\n      into bed with me.

The Counterpane. ": {"0": "\n      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\u2019s arm thrown\n      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought\n      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little\n      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all\n      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of\n      which were of one precise shade\u2014owing I suppose to his keeping his\n      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly\n      rolled up at various times\u2014this same arm of his, I say, looked for\n      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly\n      lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from\n      the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n      sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging\n      me.\n    ", "1": "\n      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\n      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other\u2014I\n      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep\n      do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all\n      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,\u2014my mother\n      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though\n      it was only two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day\n      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help\n      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,\n      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a\n      bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n    ", "2": "\n      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of\n      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in\n      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the\n      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse\u2014at\n      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,\n      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,\n      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my\n      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an\n      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of\n      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay\n      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,\n      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen\n      into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it\u2014half\n      steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was\n      now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through\n      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,\n      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand\n      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled\n      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag\n      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single\n      inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness\n      at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly\n      remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost\n      myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very\n      hour, I often puzzle myself with it.\n    ", "3": "\n      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\u2019s pagan arm\n      thrown round me. But at length all the past night\u2019s events soberly\n      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the\n      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm\u2014unlock his\n      bridegroom clasp\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\n      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to\n      rouse him\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then\n      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly\n      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the\n      tomahawk sleeping by the savage\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced\n      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in\n      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the\n      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling,\n      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all\n      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff\n      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of\n      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I\n      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon\n      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed\n      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it\n      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain\n      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would\n      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is\n      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate\n      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially\n      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he\n      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of\n      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette\n      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\n      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways\n      were well worth unusual regarding.\n    ", "4": "\n      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\n      by the by, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his\n      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\n      movement was to crush himself\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\u2014under\n      the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\n      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\n      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage\u2014neither\n      caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his\n      outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not\n      yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree\n      civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at\n      all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have\n      dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with\n      his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n      creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to\n      boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones\u2014probably not made to\n      order either\u2014rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of\n      a bitter cold morning.\n    ", "5": "\n      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into\n      the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg\n      made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged\n      him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\n      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied,\n      and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any\n      Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement,\n      contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and\n      hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\n      the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering\n      his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and\n      behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long\n      wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n      striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n      scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is\n      using Rogers\u2019s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the\n      less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of\n      a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are\n      always kept.\n    ", "6": "\n      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\n      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\n      harpoon like a marshal\u2019s baton.\n    ", "7": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 5.

": {"0": "\n      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\n      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\n      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\n      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was\n      the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a\n      very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,\n      but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the\n      time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy\n      old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering\n      youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain\n      mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping\n      forth even beneath February\u2019s snow. No one having previously heard his\n      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\n      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities\n      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he\n      entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come\n      in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and\n      his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with\n      the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and\n      overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an\n      adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the\n      pulpit.\n    ", "1": "\n      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,\n      seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it\n      seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit\n      without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those\n      used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain\n      had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for\n      this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a\n      mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel\n      it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the\n      foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of\n      the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the\n      steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n    ", "2": "\n      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\n      swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,\n      so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the\n      pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these\n      joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared\n      to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and\n      stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,\n      till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little\n      Quebec.\n    ", "3": "\n      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,\n      that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of\n      the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;\n      furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.

Yet\n      what depths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\n      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the\n      fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods\n      surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;\n      sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But what is this lesson\n      that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a\n      lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the\n      living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story\n      of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift\n      punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of\n      Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was\n      in his wilful disobedience of the command of God\u2014never mind now what\n      that command was, or how conveyed\u2014which he found a hard command. But\n      all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember\n      that\u2014and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.\n      And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this\n      disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\n    ", "6": "\n      \u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,\n      by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry\n      him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this\n      earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\u2019s bound\n      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By\n      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\n      That\u2019s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is\n      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed\n      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\n      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast\n      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two\n      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of\n      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee\n      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of\n      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;\n      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the\n      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been\n      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,\n      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he\u2019s a fugitive! no\n      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\u2014no friends accompany\n      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\n      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he\n      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\n      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\u2019s evil eye.\n      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in\n      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the\n      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,\n      one whispers to the other\u2014\u201cJack, he\u2019s robbed a widow;\u201d or, \u201cJoe, do\n      you mark him; he\u2019s a bigamist;\u201d or, \u201cHarry lad, I guess he\u2019s the adulterer\n      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers\n      from Sodom.\u201d Another runs to read the bill that\u2019s stuck against the spile\n      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold\n      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of\n      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\n      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands\n      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his\n      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself\n      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of\n      it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,\n      they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.\n    ", "7": "\n      \u201c\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out\n      his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Oh! how that harmless\n      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But\n      he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,\n      sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man\n      now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than\n      he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the next coming tide,\u2019 at\n      last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon\n      enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s\n      another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \u2018I\u2019ll\n      sail with ye,\u2019\u2014he says,\u2014\u2018the passage money how much is that?\u2014I\u2019ll\n      pay now.\u2019 For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing\n      not to be overlooked in this history, \u2018that he paid the fare thereof\u2019 ere\n      the craft did sail.

In this\n      world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a\n      passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So\n      Jonah\u2019s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\u2019s purse, ere he judge\n      him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it\u2019s assented to.\n      Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time\n      resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah\n      fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.\n      He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he\n      mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. \u2018Point out my state-room,\n      Sir,\u2019 says Jonah now, \u2018I\u2019m travel-weary; I need sleep.\u2019 \u2018Thou lookest like\n      it,\u2019 says the Captain, \u2018there\u2019s thy room.\u2019 Jonah enters, and would lock\n      the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling\n      there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about\n      the doors of convicts\u2019 cells being never allowed to be locked within. All\n      dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds\n      the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\n      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath\n      the ship\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that\n      stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his\n      bowels\u2019 wards.\n    ", "9": "\n      \u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates\n      in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the\n      weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in\n      slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the\n      room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious\n      the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens\n      Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and\n      this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.\n      But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,\n      the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in\n      me!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\n      soul are all in crookedness!\u2019\n    ", "10": "\n      \u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\n      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\n      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as\n      one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,\n      praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the\n      whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who\n      bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there\u2019s naught to\n      staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah\u2019s prodigy of\n      ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n    ", "11": "\n      \u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\n      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\n      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!\n      the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked\n      burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when\n      the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars\n      are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are\n      yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\u2019s\n      head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees\n      no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little\n      hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with\n      open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone\n      down into the sides of the ship\u2014a berth in the cabin as I have taken\n      it, and was fast asleep.

Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy\n      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning\n      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face\n      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the\n      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again\n      towards the tormented deep.\n    ", "12": "\n      \u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.

Aye,\n      well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to\n      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\n      appalled, but still are pitiful.

But\n      all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised\n      invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of\n      Jonah.\n    ", "14": "\n      \u201cAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when\n      instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,\n      as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He\n      goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he\n      scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws\n      awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many\n      white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the\n      fish\u2019s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For\n      sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He\n      feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance\n      to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and\n      pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is\n      true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\n      punishment.

He was\n      sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and\n      in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of\n      his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling\n      away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\n    ", "1": "\n      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to\n      the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began\n      counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page\u2014as\n      I fancied\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving\n      utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then\n      begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each\n      time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by\n      such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment\n      at the multitude of pages was excited.\n    ", "2": "\n      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously\n      marred about the face\u2014at least to my taste\u2014his countenance yet\n      had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide\n      the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces\n      of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and\n      bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.\n      And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,\n      which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man\n      who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too,\n      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and\n      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I\n      will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was\n      phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded\n      me of General Washington\u2019s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It\n      had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows,\n      which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly\n      wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\n    ", "3": "\n      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\n      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,\n      never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared\n      wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.\n      Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,\n      and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me\n      upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very\n      strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly\n      how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm\n      self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed\n      also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\n      other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no\n      desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as\n      mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost\n      sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the\n      way of Cape Horn, that is\u2014which was the only way he could get there\u2014thrown\n      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;\n      and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;\n      content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this\n      was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there\n      was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we\n      mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I\n      hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I\n      conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have \u201cbroken his\n      digester.\u201d\n     ", "4": "\n      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild\n      stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only\n      glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the\n      casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm\n      booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange\n      feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened\n      hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had\n      redeemed it.

I\u2019ll\n      try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but\n      hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs\n      and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little\n      noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last\n      night\u2019s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be\n      bedfellows.

In a countryman, this sudden flame\n      of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much\n      distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.\n    ", "7": "\n      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\n      together.

I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by\n      pouring them into my trowsers\u2019 pockets. I let them stay. He then went\n      about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper\n      fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for\n      me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a\n      moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\n    ", "8": "\n      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\n      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\n      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\n      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth\u2014pagans\n      and all included\u2014can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of\n      black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?\u2014to do the will of God\u2014that\n      is worship. And what is the will of God?\u2014to do to my fellow man what\n      I would have my fellow man to do to me\u2014that is the will of God. Now,\n      Queequeg is my fellow man.

The more so, I say, because\n      truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for\n      there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by\n      contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are\n      all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be\n      said to be comfortable any more.

For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be\n      furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the\n      rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but\n      the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.\n      Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic\n      crystal.\n    ", "2": "\n      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\n      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by\n      day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\n      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\n      being in bed.

Nor did I\n      at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to\n      strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a\n      strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,\n      that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed\n      the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love\n      once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have\n      Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such\n      serene household joy then.

His\n      father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the\n      maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable\n      warriors.

But this fine young savage\u2014this sea Prince of\n      Wales, never saw the Captain\u2019s cabin. They put him down among the sailors,\n      and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the\n      shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if\n      thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored\n      countrymen. For at bottom\u2014so he told me\u2014he was actuated by a\n      profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make\n      his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better\n      than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him\n      that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\n      so, than all his father\u2019s heathens.

To this, in substance, he replied,\n      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular\n      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried\n      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In\n      short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers\u2019\n      meadows armed with their own scythes\u2014though in no wise obliged to\n      furnish them\u2014even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons,\n      preferred his own harpoon.\n    ", "2": "\n      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\n      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.

Sideways leaning,\n      we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall\n      masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this\n      reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some\n      time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\n      lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so\n      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\n      whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by\n      their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all\n      verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind\n      his back. I thought the bumpkin\u2019s hour of doom was come.

The poor fellow\n      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were\n      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed\n      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking\n      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into\n      splinters.

The schooner was run into the wind, and\n      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to\n      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.

Shooting himself\n      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant\u2019s glance\n      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and\n      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking\n      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked\n      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored.

All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\n      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm\n      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons\n      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly\n      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her\n      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one\n      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary\n      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the\n      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\n      craft, but somehow a most melancholy!

It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;\n      consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the\n      middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their\n      broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually\n      sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where\n      the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\n      Pottowottamie Sachem\u2019s head.

He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over\n      with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout\n      interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.\n    ", "6": "\n      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the\n      elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and\n      heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there\n      was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles\n      interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual\n      sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;\u2014for\n      this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.

For some of these same Quakers are the\n      most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting\n      Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n    ", "42": "\n      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\n      names\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\u2014and in\n      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\n      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\n      of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\n      peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\n      Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\n      unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\n      and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many\n      long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations\n      never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and\n      independently; receiving all nature\u2019s sweet or savage impressions fresh\n      from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,\n      but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous\n      lofty language\u2014that man makes one in a whole nation\u2019s census\u2014a\n      mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.

But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,\n      but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only\n      results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual\n      circumstances.\n    ", "43": "\n      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\n      unlike Captain Peleg\u2014who cared not a rush for what are called\n      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\n      veriest of all trifles\u2014Captain Bildad had not only been originally\n      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\n      his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\n      creatures, round the Horn\u2014all that had not moved this native born\n      Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.\n      Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\n      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\n      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\n      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\n      to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\n      upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\n      days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n      not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\n      had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man\u2019s\n      religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world\n      pays dividends.

For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\n      certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,\n      though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity\n      of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate,\n      to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel\n      completely nervous, till you could clutch something\u2014a hammer or a\n      marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind\n      what.

Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth\n      the ship\u2019s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at\n      a little table.

And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay,\n      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty\n      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my\n      three years\u2019 beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\n    ", "54": "\n      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n      fortune\u2014and so it was, a very poor way indeed.

Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\n      would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\n      been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\n    ", "55": "\n      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\n      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\n      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the\n      other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole\n      management of the ship\u2019s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what\n      the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping\n      hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home\n      there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside.

Transported to the Indies, his live blood would\n      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general\n      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is\n      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried\n      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,\n      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed\n      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the\n      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight\n      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with\n      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck\n      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as\n      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his\n      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.

Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if\n      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his\n      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend\n      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him\n      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted\n      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in\n      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. \u201cI will have no man in my\n      boat,\u201d said Starbuck, \u201cwho is not afraid of a whale.\u201d By this, he seemed\n      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which\n      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\n      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\n    ", "1": "\n      \u201cAye, aye,\u201d said Stubb, the second mate, \u201cStarbuck, there, is as careful a\n      man as you\u2019ll find anywhere in this fishery.\u201d But we shall ere long see\n      what that word \u201ccareful\u201d precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or\n      almost any other whale hunter.\n    ", "2": "\n      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;\n      but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally\n      practical occasions.

Wherefore he had\n      no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in\n      fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him.

He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part\n      of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When\n      close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his\n      unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.\n      He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the\n      most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the\n      jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there\n      is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\n      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable\n      dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of\n      the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something\n      which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\n    ", "1": "\n      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing\n      man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of\n      grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to\n      bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have\n      been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of\n      the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected\n      him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept\n      a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy\n      reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in\n      succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then\n      loading them again to be in readiness anew.

A\n      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who\n      somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and\n      hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor\n      with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to\n      all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and\n      mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible\n      danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous\n      whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,\n      requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time\n      and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious\n      fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he\n      followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years\u2019 voyage round\n      Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a\n      carpenter\u2019s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind\n      may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made\n      to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the\n      Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square\n      timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of\n      many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship\n      against the icy concussions of those battering seas.\n    ", "4": "\n      Now these three mates\u2014Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous\n      men.

In the fishery, they\n      usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego\u2019s long, lean,\n      sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes\u2014for an\n      Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering\n      expression\u2014all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the\n      unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the\n      great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests\n      of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\n      woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;\n      the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of\n      the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would\n      almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,\n      and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\n      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate\u2019s squire.\n    ", "8": "\n      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread\u2014an Ahasuerus to behold.\n      Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors\n      called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards\n      to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\n      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere\n      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most\n      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of\n      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of\n      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\n      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his\n      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white\n      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a\n      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the\n      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the\n      residue of the Pequod\u2019s company, be it said, that at the present day not\n      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the\n      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the\n      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as\n      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the\n      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and\n      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American\n      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously\n      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to\n      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to\n      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like\n      manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the\n      Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the\n      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no\n      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly\n      all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging\n      the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate\n      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these\n      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the\n      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to\n      lay the world\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of\n      them ever come back. Black Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he\n      went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall\n      ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,\n      when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in\n      with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,\n      hailed a hero there!\n    ", "9": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 28. Ahab. ": {"0": "\n      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen\n      of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,\n      and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the\n      only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin\n      with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but\n      commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,\n      though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now\n      sacred retreat of the cabin.\n    ", "1": "\n      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed\n      aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\n      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,\n      became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by\n      the ragged Elijah\u2019s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,\n      with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly\n      could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile\n      at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.\n      But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness\u2014to call it so\u2014which\n      I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed\n      against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the\n      harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,\n      heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies\n      which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I\n      ascribed this\u2014and rightly ascribed it\u2014to the fierce uniqueness\n      of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so\n      abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief\n      officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to\n      allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness\n      in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers\n      and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and\n      they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape\n      man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a\n      space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from\n      it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we\n      sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\n      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and\n      gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship\n      was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and\n      melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the\n      forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,\n      foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab\n      stood upon his quarter-deck.\n    ", "2": "\n      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the\n      fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or\n      taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole\n      high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\n      unalterable mould, like Cellini\u2019s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from\n      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny\n      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a\n      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular\n      seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the\n      upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single\n      twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off\n      into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether\n      that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\n      desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,\n      throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by\n      the mates. But once Tashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the\n      crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old\n      did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\n      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild\n      hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an\n      old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had\n      never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old\n      sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old\n      Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor\n      seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should\n      be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might hardly come to pass, so he\n      muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,\n      would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\n    ", "3": "\n      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid\n      brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted\n      that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric\n      white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that\n      this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the\n      sperm whale\u2019s jaw. \u201cAye, he was dismasted off Japan,\u201d said the old\n      Gay-Head Indian once; \u201cbut like his dismasted craft, he shipped another\n      mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of \u2019em.\u201d\n     ", "4": "\n      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\n      the Pequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there\n      was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His\n      bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;\n      Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship\u2019s\n      ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a\n      determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,\n      forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\n      officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and\n      expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness\n      of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody\n      stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the\n      nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\n    ", "5": "\n      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But\n      after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing\n      in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily\n      walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a\n      little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the\n      ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the\n      sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that\n      he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,\n      or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary\n      there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not\n      regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision\n      the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,\n      out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for\n      that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his\n      brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves\n      upon.\n    ", "6": "\n      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,\n      holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.\n      For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to\n      the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most\n      thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to\n      welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little\n      respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did\n      he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would\n      have soon flowered out in a smile.\n    ", "7": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 29.

The warmly\n      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as\n      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up\u2014flaked up, with\n      rose-water snow.

But all\n      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and\n      potencies to the outward world.

And then, presto!\n      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it.

Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be\n      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\n    ", "14": "\n      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from\n      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the\n      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with\n      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the\n      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this\n      ground-plan of Cetology.

(Sperm Whale).\u2014This whale, among the\n      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,\n      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the\n      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,\n      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of\n      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far\n      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that\n      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,\n      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I\n      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries\n      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper\n      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the\n      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly\n      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known\n      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that\n      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale\n      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,\n      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but\n      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the\n      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in\n      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its\n      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its\n      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the\n      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from\n      which this spermaceti was really derived.\n    ", "21": "\n      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).\u2014In one respect this is\n      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted\n      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and\n      the oil specially known as \u201cwhale oil,\u201d an inferior article in commerce.\n      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the\n      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the\n      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity\n      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What\n      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It\n      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of\n      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the\n      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two\n      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic\n      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in\n      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\u2019 West Coast, and various\n      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\n    ", "22": "\n      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\n      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in\n      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\n      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\n      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\n      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The\n      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to\n      elucidating the sperm whale.\n    ", "23": "\n      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).\u2014Under this head I reckon a\n      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\n      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\n      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\n      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in\n      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\n      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips\n      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\n      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\n      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three\n      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of\n      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the\n      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,\n      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is\n      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this\n      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it\n      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat\n      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that\n      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He\n      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going\n      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most\n      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\n      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power\n      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this\n      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing\n      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his\n      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a\n      theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with\n      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be\n      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed\n      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\n      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\u2019s names for a few sorts.\n    ", "24": "\n      In connection with this appellative of \u201cWhalebone whales,\u201d it is of great\n      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient\n      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to\n      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his\n      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts\n      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a\n      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,\n      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,\n      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\n      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard\n      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential\n      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a\n      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale\n      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the\n      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above\n      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular\n      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an\n      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed\n      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has\n      split.\n    ", "25": "\n      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,\n      in his anatomy\u2014there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right\n      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland\n      whale\u2019s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by\n      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And\n      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you\n      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the\n      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?\n      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal\n      volume, and boldly sort them that way.

He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might\n      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for\n      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has\n      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable.

I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because\n      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena\n      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\n      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\n      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\n      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\n      all latitudes.

When not more\n      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena\n      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment\u2014as\n      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by\n      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their\n      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of\n      thirty gallons of oil.\n    ", "34": "\n      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.\u2014Another\n      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar\n      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some\n      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some\n      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn\n      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little\n      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,\n      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the\n      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn\n      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used\n      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell\n      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of\n      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for\n      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it\n      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you\n      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,\n      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale\u2014however\n      that may be\u2014it would certainly be very convenient to him for a\n      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked\n      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious\n      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated\n      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\n      sea-unicorn\u2019s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\n      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.

": {"0": "\n      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as\n      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from\n      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of\n      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n    ", "1": "\n      The large importance attached to the harpooneer\u2019s vocation is evinced by\n      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more\n      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now\n      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the\n      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time\n      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain\u2019s\n      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the\n      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the\n      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland\n      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch\n      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At\n      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of\n      the captain\u2019s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good\n      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important\n      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a\n      whaling ground) the command of the ship\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the\n      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live\n      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as\n      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded\n      as their social equal.\n    ", "2": "\n      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this\u2014the\n      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen\n      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in\n      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part\n      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain\u2019s cabin,\n      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.\n    ", "3": "\n      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of\n      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the\n      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or\n      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common\n      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;\n      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous\n      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an\n      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,\n      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the\n      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.\n      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\n      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any\n      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore\n      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n    ", "4": "\n      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given\n      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever\n      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man\n      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and\n      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected\n      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,\n      whether of condescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain\n      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the\n      sea.\n    ", "5": "\n      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those\n      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally\n      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were\n      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,\n      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those\n      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible\n      dictatorship. For be a man\u2019s intellectual superiority what it will, it can\n      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without\n      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in\n      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps\n      God\u2019s true princes of the Empire from the world\u2019s hustings; and leaves the\n      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous\n      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of\n      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead\n      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when\n      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances\n      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the\n      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire\n      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before\n      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\n      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever\n      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now\n      alluded to.\n    ", "6": "\n      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness\n      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must\n      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;\n      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied\n      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at\n      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied\n      air!\n    ", "7": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table. ": {"0": "\n      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread\n      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,\n      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of\n      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,\n      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part\n      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would\n      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching\n      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,\n      unexhilarated voice, saying, \u201cDinner, Mr. Starbuck,\u201d disappears into the\n      cabin.\n    ", "1": "\n      When the last echo of his sultan\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck, the\n      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck\n      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a\n      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,\n      \u201cDinner, Mr. Stubb,\u201d and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges\n      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see\n      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes\n      up the old burden, and with a rapid \u201cDinner, Mr. Flask,\u201d follows after his\n      predecessors.\n    ", "2": "\n      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts\n      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he\n      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the\n      Grand Turk\u2019s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up\n      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as\n      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by\n      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway\n      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,\n      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\u2019s presence, in the character of\n      Abjectus, or the Slave.\n    ", "3": "\n      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some\n      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly\n      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers\n      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander\u2019s\n      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and\n      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is\n      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?\n      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been\n      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have\n      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and\n      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited\n      guests, that man\u2019s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence\n      for the time; that man\u2019s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar\u2019s, for\n      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has\n      tasted what it is to be C\u00e6sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which\n      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the\n      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive\n      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n    ", "4": "\n      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on\n      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential\n      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were\n      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk\n      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all\n      fastened upon the old man\u2019s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.\n      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment\n      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the\n      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the\n      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck\u2019s plate towards\n      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it\n      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\n      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\n      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the\n      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these\n      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at\n      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a\n      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the\n      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\n      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his\n      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\n      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\n      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would\n      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\n      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the\n      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask\n      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the\n      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny\n      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\n      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,\n      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n    ", "5": "\n      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is\n      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\u2019s dinner was badly jammed in\n      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they\n      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but\n      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon\n      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,\n      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy\n      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask\n      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of\n      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much\n      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,\n      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;\n      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the\n      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There\u2019s the fruits of\n      promotion now; there\u2019s the vanity of glory: there\u2019s the insanity of life!\n      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge\n      against Flask in Flask\u2019s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in\n      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a\n      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered\n      before awful Ahab.\n    ", "6": "\n      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in\n      the Pequod\u2019s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order\n      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to\n      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers\n      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a\n      sort of temporary servants\u2019 hall of the high and mighty cabin.\n    ", "7": "\n      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n      invisible domineerings of the captain\u2019s table, was the entire care-free\n      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows\n      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the\n      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food\n      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;\n      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\n      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the\n      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain\n      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the\n      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a\n      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\n      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\n      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy\u2019s memory by\n      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden\n      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle\n      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering\n      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt\n      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the\n      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these\n      three savages, Dough-Boy\u2019s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.\n      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they\n      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry\n      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,\n      till all was over.\n    ", "8": "\n      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his\n      filed teeth to the Indian\u2019s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the\n      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low\n      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin\n      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.\n      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say\n      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small\n      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\n      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\n      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\n      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or\n      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,\n      barbaric smack of the lip in eating\u2014an ugly sound enough\u2014so\n      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\n      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\n      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\n      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\n      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances\n      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would\n      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all\n      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\n      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\n      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white\n      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,\n      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three\n      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering\n      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish\n      scimetars in scabbards.\n    ", "9": "\n      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\n      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\n    ", "10": "\n      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\n      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the\n      ship\u2019s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\n      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the\n      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have\n      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was\n      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,\n      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the\n      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no\n      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included\n      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the\n      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as\n      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying\n      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his\n      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab\u2019s soul, shut up in\n      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n    ", "11": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head. ": {"0": "\n      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\n      other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n    ", "1": "\n      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously\n      with the vessel\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen\n      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.\n      And if, after a three, four, or five years\u2019 voyage she is drawing nigh\n      home with anything empty in her\u2014say, an empty vial even\u2014then,\n      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles\n      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the\n      hope of capturing one whale more.\n    ", "2": "\n      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\n      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take\n      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;\n      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their\n      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have\n      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet\n      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may\n      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God\u2019s wrath;\n      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the\n      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is\n      an assertion based upon the general belief among arch\u00e6ologists, that the\n      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly\n      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those\n      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those\n      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new\n      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a\n      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian\n      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and\n      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his\n      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance\n      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\n      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\n      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\n      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and\n      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still\n      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any\n      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of\n      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the\n      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,\n      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft\n      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules\u2019 pillars,\n      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\n      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his\n      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London\n      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\n      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\n      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick\n      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.\n    ", "3": "\n      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers\n      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is\n      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of\n      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early\n      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit\n      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the\n      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,\n      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same\n      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying\n      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this\n      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,\n      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\n      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of\n      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy\n      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the\n      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic\n      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the\n      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of\n      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite\n      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\n      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\n      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\n      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\n      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;\n      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have\n      for dinner\u2014for all your meals for three years and more are snugly\n      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\n    ", "4": "\n      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\u2019 voyage,\n      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head\n      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that\n      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term\n      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching\n      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of\n      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a\n      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in\n      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch\n      is the head of the t\u2019 gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel\n      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t\u2019 gallant cross-trees.\n      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he\n      would standing on a bull\u2019s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may\n      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but\n      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the\n      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and\n      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running\n      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps\n      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere\n      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest\n      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\n      your watch-coat.\n    ", "5": "\n      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\n      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\n      pulpits, called crow\u2019s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler\n      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the\n      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \u201cA Voyage among the\n      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\n      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\u201d in this\n      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\n      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n      crow\u2019s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\u2019s good\n      craft. He called it the Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest, in honor of himself; he\n      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous\n      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own\n      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise\n      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In\n      shape, the Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;\n      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable\n      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed\n      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch\n      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a\n      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and\n      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,\n      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in\n      person stood his mast-head in this crow\u2019s-nest of his, he tells us that he\n      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a\n      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,\n      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\n      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\n      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was\n      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the\n      little detailed conveniences of his crow\u2019s-nest; but though he so enlarges\n      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account\n      of his experiments in this crow\u2019s-nest, with a small compass he kept there\n      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called\n      the \u201clocal attraction\u201d of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the\n      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship\u2019s planks, and in the Glacier\u2019s\n      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among\n      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific\n      here, yet, for all his learned \u201cbinnacle deviations,\u201d \u201cazimuth compass\n      observations,\u201d and \u201capproximate errors,\u201d he knows very well, Captain\n      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\n      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well\n      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his\n      crow\u2019s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I\n      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;\n      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\n      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\n      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the\n      mathematics aloft there in that bird\u2019s nest within three or four perches\n      of the pole.\n    ", "6": "\n      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain\n      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly\n      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive\n      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up\n      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with\n      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending\n      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take\n      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my\n      ultimate destination.\n    ", "7": "\n      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but\n      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I\u2014being\n      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude\u2014how\n      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships\u2019\n      standing orders, \u201cKeep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.\u201d\n     ", "8": "\n      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\n      Nantucket!

Stand up amid the\n      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?\n      Reckon it. \u2019Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.\n      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all\n      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has\n      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow\n      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!\u2014Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that\n      voices thee.

A wild,\n      mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab\u2019s quenchless feud seemed\n      mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster\n      against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and\n      revenge.\n    ", "1": "\n      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded\n      White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the\n      Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a\n      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who\n      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.\n      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they\n      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them\n      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom\n      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a\n      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each\n      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all\n      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the\n      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\n      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,\n      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,\n      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and\n      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\n      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I\n      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.\n      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not\n      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster\n      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave\n      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were\n      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the\n      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.\n      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale\n      had hitherto been popularly regarded.\n    ", "2": "\n      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\n      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of\n      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other\n      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these\n      assaults\u2014not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,\n      or devouring amputations\u2014but fatal to the last degree of fatality;\n      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their\n      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude\n      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually\n      come.\n    ", "3": "\n      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\n      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\n      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\n      terrible events,\u2014as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,\n      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\n      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And\n      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\n      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\n      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\n      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness\n      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the\n      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly\n      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest\n      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest\n      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand\n      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught\n      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,\n      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by\n      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty\n      birth.\n    ", "4": "\n      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the\n      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the\n      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\n      half-formed f\u0153tal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually\n      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly\n      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that\n      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of\n      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.\n    ", "5": "\n      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\n      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,\n      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died\n      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among\n      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to\n      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps\u2014either from professional\n      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the\n      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among\n      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never\n      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the\n      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the\n      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\n      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.\n      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere\n      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\n    ", "6": "\n      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists\u2014Olassen\n      and Povelson\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a\n      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so\n      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor\n      even down to so late a time as Cuvier\u2019s, were these or almost similar\n      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms\n      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are \u201cstruck\n      with the most lively terrors,\u201d and \u201coften in the precipitancy of their\n      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause\n      instantaneous death.\u201d And however the general experiences in the fishery\n      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to\n      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in\n      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\n    ", "7": "\n      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of\n      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the\n      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised\n      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;\n      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully\n      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm\n      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to\n      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable\n      documents that may be consulted.\n    ", "8": "\n      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were\n      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing\n      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of\n      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were\n      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.\n    ", "9": "\n      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\n      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the\n      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been\n      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.\n    ", "10": "\n      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether\n      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets\n      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most\n      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the\n      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from\n      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory\n      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes\n      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such\n      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.\n    ", "11": "\n      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as\n      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that\n      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies\n      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is\n      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared\n      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded\n      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some\n      whalemen, that the Nor\u2019 West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never\n      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of\n      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\n      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which\n      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more\n      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were\n      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these\n      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the\n      whalemen.\n    ", "12": "\n      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing\n      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;\n      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still\n      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,\n      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves\n      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away\n      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a\n      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows\n      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\n    ", "13": "\n      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\n      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the\n      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk\n      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was\n      elsewhere thrown out\u2014a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a\n      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the\n      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his\n      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\n    ", "14": "\n      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\n      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\n      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his\n      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,\n      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\n      gleamings.\n    ", "15": "\n      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\n      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,\n      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific\n      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than\n      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught\n      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent\n      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,\n      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or\n      drive them back in consternation to their ship.\n    ", "16": "\n      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\n      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the\n      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale\u2019s infernal\n      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,\n      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent\n      agent.\n    ", "17": "\n      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his\n      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,\n      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds\n      of the whale\u2019s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that\n      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n    ", "18": "\n      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\n      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\n      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking\n      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That\n      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his\n      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab\u2019s leg,\n      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired\n      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small\n      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal\n      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all\n      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to\n      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual\n      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the\n      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men\n      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\n      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;\n      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the\n      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue\n      devil;\u2014Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but\n      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted\n      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;\n      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all\n      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of\n      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and\n      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale\u2019s white\n      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from\n      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot\n      heart\u2019s shell upon it.\n    ", "19": "\n      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\n      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,\n      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal\n      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but\n      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this\n      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and\n      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in\n      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his\n      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made\n      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the\n      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from\n      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\n      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his\n      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his\n      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in\n      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the\n      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with\n      mild stun\u2019sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all\n      appearances, the old man\u2019s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape\n      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light\n      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\n      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\n      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved\n      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you\n      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler\n      form. Ahab\u2019s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like\n      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but\n      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing\n      monomania, not one jot of Ahab\u2019s broad madness had been left behind; so in\n      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had\n      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If\n      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general\n      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own\n      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one\n      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely\n      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.\n    ", "20": "\n      This is much; yet Ahab\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But\n      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far\n      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we\n      here stand\u2014however grand and wonderful, now quit it;\u2014and take\n      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\n      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man\u2019s upper earth, his root of\n      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried\n      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the\n      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,\n      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down\n      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family\n      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your\n      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\n    ", "21": "\n      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are\n      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,\n      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;\n      in some sort, did still.

Though, in these cases, the\n      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor\u2019s parallel, and\n      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,\n      straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said\n      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the\n      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual\n      sweep from the whale-ship\u2019s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along\n      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that\n      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be\n      looked for.\n    ", "6": "\n      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\n      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,\n      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly\n      without prospect of a meeting.\n    ", "7": "\n      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.\n      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for\n      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds\n      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will\n      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the\n      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances\n      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,\n      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among\n      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former\n      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the\n      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,\n      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,\n      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\n      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\n      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab\u2019s chances of\n      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only\n      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere\n      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would\n      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\n      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were\n      conjoined in the one technical phrase\u2014the Season-on-the-Line. For\n      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,\n      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of\n      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the\n      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;\n      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the\n      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and\n      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this\n      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon\n      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to\n      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\n      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n    ", "8": "\n      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\n      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander\n      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running\n      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to\n      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the\n      premature hour of the Pequod\u2019s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly\n      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,\n      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before\n      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would\n      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his\n      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should\n      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or\n      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,\n      Pampas, Nor\u2019-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and\n      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\n      Pequod\u2019s circumnavigating wake.\n    ", "9": "\n      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not\n      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary\n      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual\n      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged\n      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of\n      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And\n      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after\n      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself\n      back in reveries\u2014tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins\n      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep\u2019s ear! And here, his mad\n      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of\n      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to\n      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man\n      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps\n      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.\n    ", "10": "\n      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\n      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the\n      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round\n      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his\n      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the\n      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and\n      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings\n      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when\n      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through\n      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as\n      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead\n      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at\n      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at\n      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the\n      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent\n      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the\n      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time\n      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it\n      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\n      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was\n      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\n      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\u2019s case, yielding up\n      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by\n      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils\n      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could\n      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,\n      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,\n      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab\n      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless\n      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an\n      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old\n      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense\n      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for\n      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.\n    ", "11": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 45.

In the instance where three years\n      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may\n      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in\n      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore\n      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,\n      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by\n      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common\n      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,\n      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it\n      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the\n      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came\n      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known\n      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales\n      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective\n      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year\n      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and\n      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole\n      under the whale\u2019s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I\n      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are\n      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have\n      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter\n      there is no good ground to impeach.\n    ", "3": "\n      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\n      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\n      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\n      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\n      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\n      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in\n      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\n      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\n      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of\n      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a\n      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen\n      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he\n      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to\n      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that\n      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\n      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance\n      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.\n    ", "4": "\n      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\n      celebrity\u2014Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\n      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but\n      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a\n      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or C\u00e6sar.

One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,\n      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales\n      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,\n      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his\n      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than \u201cten\n      minutes\u201d she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has\n      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the\n      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once\n      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\n      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time\n      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never\n      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.\n      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the\n      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed\n      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the\n      catastrophe.*\n    ", "11": "\n      *The following are extracts from Chace\u2019s narrative: \u201cEvery fact seemed to\n      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed\n      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short\n      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were\n      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby\n      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the\n      exact man\u0153uvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most\n      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury.

Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable\n      craft for Valparaiso.

Captain\n      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\n    ", "17": "\n      \u201cBy the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we\n      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very\n      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on\n      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till\n      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon\n      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost\n      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board\n      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon\n      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We\n      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,\n      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.\n      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon\n      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost\n      gravity and solemnity. Captain D\u2019Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to\n      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,\n      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.\u201d\n     ", "18": "\n      Now, the Captain D\u2019Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures\n      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near\n      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly\n      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates\n      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian\n      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after\n      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\n    ", "19": "\n      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,\n      of honest wonders\u2014the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\n      Dampier\u2019s old chums\u2014I found a little matter set down so like that\n      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\n      corroborative example, if such be needed.\n    ", "20": "\n      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \u201cJohn Ferdinando,\u201d as he calls the\n      modern Juan Fernandes. \u201cIn our way thither,\u201d he says, \u201cabout four o\u2019clock\n      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the\n      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such\n      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to\n      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock\n      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck\n      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the\n      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock\n      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken\n      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was\n      thrown out of his cabin!\u201d Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a\n      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\n      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused\n      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\n    ", "21": "\n      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\n      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\n      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\n      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\n      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\n      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me\n      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running\n      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured\n      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks\n      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm\n      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often\n      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\n      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\n      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and\n      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I\n      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a\n      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,\n      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by\n      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)\n      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say\n      amen with Solomon\u2014Verily there is nothing new under the sun.\n    ", "22": "\n      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\n      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius\n      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every\n      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been\n      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some\n      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be\n      mentioned.\n    ", "23": "\n      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of\n      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the\n      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels\n      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact\n      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is\n      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster\n      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other\n      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a\n      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the\n      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep\n      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place\n      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have\n      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated\n      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am\n      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of\n      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of\n      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by\n      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n    ", "24": "\n      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance\n      called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have\n      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale\u2014squid or\n      cuttle-fish\u2014lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large\n      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at\n      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and\n      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all\n      human reasoning, Procopius\u2019s sea-monster, that for half a century stove\n      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm\n      whale.\n    ", "25": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 46. Surmises.

Or at least if this were\n      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with\n      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his\n      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might\n      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that\n      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances\n      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one\n      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were\n      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according\n      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of\n      swaying him.\n    ", "1": "\n      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\n      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for\n      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over\n      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any\n      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for\n      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal\n      relation. Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced will were Ahab\u2019s, so long\n      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain; still he knew that for all\n      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain\u2019s quest, and could\n      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It\n      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.\n      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open\n      relapses of rebellion against his captain\u2019s leadership, unless some\n      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon\n      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick\n      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and\n      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some\n      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally\n      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn\n      into the obscure background (for few men\u2019s courage is proof against\n      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their\n      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\n      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage\n      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all\n      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable\u2014they live in the\n      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness\u2014and when\n      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\n      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\n      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and\n      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\n    ", "2": "\n      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\n      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\n      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\n      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\n      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\n      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the\n      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for\n      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric\n      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of\n      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,\n      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.

All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\n      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\n      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets\n      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself\n      with a pretty little milliner\u2019s tiller decorated with gay cords and\n      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort\n      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains\n      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent\n      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such\n      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat\u2019s crew must leave\n      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\n      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\n      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a\n      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of\n      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,\n      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his\n      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in\n      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then\n      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees\n      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only\n      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a\n      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because\n      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make\n      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it\n      would never do in plain sight of the world\u2019s riveted eyes, it would never\n      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the\n      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as\n      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands\n      in his trowsers\u2019 pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy\n      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred\n      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known\n      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say\u2014to\n      seize hold of the nearest oarsman\u2019s hair, and hold on there like grim\n      death.\n    ", "9": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 54.

Now,\n      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large\n      and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla;\n      this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been\n      nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected\n      with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand\n      fresh-water seas of ours,\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\n      Superior, and Michigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with\n      many of the ocean\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\n      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,\n      even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great\n      contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime\n      approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all\n      round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by\n      the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet\n      thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to\n      wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry\n      wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered\n      forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic\n      genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and\n      silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they\n      mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago\n      villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed\n      cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by\n      Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave;\n      they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,\n      they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.\n      Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and\n      wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for\n      Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone\n      Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had\n      long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\n      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,\n      fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this\n      Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a\n      mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible\n      firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which\n      is the meanest slave\u2019s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been\n      retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far;\n      but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\u2014but, gentlemen,\n      you shall hear.\n    ", "9": "\n      \u201cIt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow\n      for her island haven, that the Town-Ho\u2019s leak seemed again increasing, but\n      only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must\n      know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example,\n      some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of\n      a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his\n      duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates\n      would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to\n      the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the\n      westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging\n      at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable\n      length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any\n      other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel\n      is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\n      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n    ", "10": "\n      \u201cMuch this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\n      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\n      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\n      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded\n      to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and\n      as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his\n      own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you\n      can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this\n      solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that\n      it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were\n      working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\n      gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\n      continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain\n      spring, gentlemen\u2014that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck,\n      and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\n    ", "11": "\n      \u201cNow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\n      world of ours\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in\n      command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\n      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\n      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance\n      he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern\u2019s tower, and make a little\n      heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all\n      events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and\n      a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy\u2019s\n      snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,\n      which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to\n      Charlemagne\u2019s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as\n      hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.

Now\n      what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle\n      with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so\n      it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him\n      to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove\n      some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n    ", "17": "\n      \u201cNow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\u2019s deck at sea is a piece of household\n      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\n      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\n      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\n      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\n      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\n      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if\n      boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that\n      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most\n      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain\n      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any\n      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n      case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may\n      understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n    ", "18": "\n      \u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\n      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in\n      his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand\n      this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended\n      when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and\n      as he steadfastly looked into the mate\u2019s malignant eye and perceived the\n      stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently\n      burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange\n      forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any\n      already ireful being\u2014a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by\n      really valiant men even when aggrieved\u2014this nameless phantom\n      feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n    ", "19": "\n      \u201cTherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the\n      deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at\n      all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary\n      sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing\n      all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and\n      outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile\n      advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper\u2019s club\n      hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\n    ", "20": "\n      \u201cHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\n      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could\n      but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the\n      conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to\n      his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few\n      inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.\n    ", "21": "\n      \u201cSteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\n      intention not to obey.

It may be worth\n      while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary\n      portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge\n      the faith of the landsman.

The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\n      that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable\n      avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came\n      into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of\n      whaling should have been there shadowed forth.

It\n      was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th\n      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down\n      to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\n      species of the Leviathan.\n    ", "4": "\n      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will\n      at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of\n      spouts, jets d\u2019eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come\n      bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.

Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men\n      seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he\n      got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one\n      of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.

Most of the scientific drawings have been\n      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing\n      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble\n      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though\n      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has\n      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in\n      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\n      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like\n      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing\n      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\n      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of\n      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale\n      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of\n      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship\u2019s deck, such is then the\n      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise\n      expression the devil himself could not catch.\n    ", "12": "\n      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\n      accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it\n      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton\n      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham\u2019s\n      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his\n      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old\n      gentleman, with all Jeremy\u2019s other leading personal characteristics; yet\n      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan\u2019s articulated\n      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale\n      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the\n      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This\n      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this\n      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in\n      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,\n      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently\n      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial\n      covering. \u201cHowever recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,\u201d said\n      humorous Stubb one day, \u201che can never be truly said to handle us without\n      mittens.\u201d\n     ", "13": "\n      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\n      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which\n      must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark\n      much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable\n      degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely\n      what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can\n      derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling\n      yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove\n      and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too\n      fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.\n    ", "14": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 56.

In the previous\n      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins\u2019s is far better\n      than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale\u2019s is the best. All Beale\u2019s drawings\n      of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of\n      three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His\n      frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to\n      excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and\n      life-like in its general effect.

That is not his fault though.\n    ", "2": "\n      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\n      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\n      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because\n      it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive\n      anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living\n      hunters.\n    ", "3": "\n      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not\n      the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\n      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken\n      from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the\n      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is\n      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the\n      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the\n      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially\n      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster\u2019s spine; and\n      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you\n      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the\n      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of\n      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub\n      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\n      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about\n      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black\n      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault\n      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that\n      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.\n    ", "4": "\n      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\n      barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy\n      bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His\n      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a\n      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking\n      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,\n      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale\n      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the\n      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of\n      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in\n      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.\n      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable\n      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping\n      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead\n      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from\n      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\n    ", "5": "\n      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was\n      either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously\n      tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting\n      action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you\n      find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in\n      that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,\n      pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every\n      sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings\n      and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly\n      unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of\n      Garnery.\n    ", "6": "\n      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\n      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\n      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England\u2019s\n      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\n      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\n      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale\n      hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem\n      entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as\n      the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of\n      effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a\n      pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving\n      us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate\n      miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical\n      engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the\n      microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a\n      shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.\n      I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a\n      veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not\n      to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a\n      Greenland Justice of the Peace.\n    ", "7": "\n      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\n      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself \u201cH.\n      Durand.\u201d One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose,\n      nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene\n      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a\n      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,\n      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together\n      in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with\n      reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few\n      aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different\n      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the\n      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of\n      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,\n      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase\n      to whales in the distance.

Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to\n      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long\n      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or\n      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the\n      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,\n      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not\n      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\n      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one\u2019s compass, while all the\n      other muscles are strained and half started\u2014what that is none know\n      but those who have tried it.

No wonder, taking\n      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for\n      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless\n      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them\n      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm\n      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many\n      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\n      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\n      you expect to find it there when most wanted!\n    ", "2": "\n      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\n      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\n      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\n      themselves and every one else.

Thereby\n      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as\n      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.

Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the\n      whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel\u2019s and seen through\n      the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the\n      two\u2014ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,\n      whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*\n    ", "3": "\n      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\n      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is\n      by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\n      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\n      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so\n      that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the\n      chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small,\n      strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight\n      in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit\n      management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass,\n      so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow\n      suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\n      smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes\n      or lobes.\n    ", "4": "\n      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on\n      deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual\n      but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that\n      the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the\n      time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this\n      liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest.

Mingling their mumblings with his\n      own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the\n      dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.

This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at\n      such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\n      symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\n      things.

According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it\n      seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency\n      over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:\n    ", "7": "\n      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\n      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\n      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\n      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\n      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,\n      was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having\n      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning\n      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and\n      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam\u2019s whaling\n      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship\u2019s getting out of\n      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself\n      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He\n      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of\n      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching\n      earnestness with which he declared these things;\u2014the dark, daring\n      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural\n      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of\n      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.\n      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much\n      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\n      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\n      apprised that that individual\u2019s intention was to land him in the first\n      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials\u2014devoting\n      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention\n      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the\n      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if\n      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was\n      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to\n      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass\n      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all\n      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and\n      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand\n      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole\n      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The\n      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;\n      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,\n      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they\n      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\n      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\n      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.

In a word, the position of the whale\u2019s eyes\n      corresponds to that of a man\u2019s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how\n      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.\n      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision\n      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more\n      behind it.

In a word, you would have\n      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man\u2014what, indeed,\n      but his eyes?\n    ", "5": "\n      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\n      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the\n      whale\u2019s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid\n      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes\n      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which\n      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one\n      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;\n      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man\n      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with\n      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are\n      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the\n      view.

So long as a man\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is\n      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever\n      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one\u2019s experience will teach him,\n      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one\n      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to\n      examine any two things\u2014however large or however small\u2014at one\n      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and\n      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\n      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one\n      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other\n      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,\n      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n      combining, and subtle than man\u2019s, that he can at the same moment of time\n      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and\n      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as\n      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go\n      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid.

He has carried with him a\n      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling\n      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down\n      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and\n      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,\n      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit\n      of the head. There\u2014still high elevated above the rest of the\n      company, to whom he vivaciously cries\u2014he seems some Turkish Muezzin\n      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\n      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for\n      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he\n      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\n      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this\n      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\n      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other\n      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert\n      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom\n      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into\n      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it\n      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up\n      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid\u2019s pail of new milk.\n      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by\n      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting\n      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will\n      yield no more.

For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower\n      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the\n      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated\n      open-work belfry of the nose.

Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare\u2019s\n      or Melancthon\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves\n      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the\n      forehead\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending\n      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.\n      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity\n      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that\n      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly\n      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one\n      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,\n      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad\n      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the\n      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous\n      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon\n      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\n      depression in the forehead\u2019s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\u2019s mark of\n      genius.\n    ", "4": "\n      But how?

But\n      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\n      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead\n      whale\u2014even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\n      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been\n      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown\n      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to\n      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I\n      would add, possibly called \u201cThe Whale,\u201d as some craft are nowadays\n      christened the \u201cShark,\u201d the \u201cGull,\u201d the \u201cEagle.\u201d Nor have there been\n      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the\n      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver\u2014an inflated bag of wind\u2014which\n      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.

Between\n      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when\n      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So\n      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a\n      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless\n      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and\n      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as\n      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising\n      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time\n      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\n      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then\n      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over\n      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\n      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his\n      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,\n      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,\n      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\n      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\n      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\n      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\n      whale\u2019s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not\n      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a\n      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\n      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n    ", "3": "\n      In man, breathing is incessantly going on\u2014one breath only serving\n      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\n      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\n      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n    ", "4": "\n      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if\n      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I\n      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems\n      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to\n      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two\n      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But\n      owing to the mystery of the spout\u2014whether it be water or whether it\n      be vapor\u2014no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this\n      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\n      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no\n      Cologne-water in the sea.\n    ", "5": "\n      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\n      canal, and as that long canal\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\u2014is\n      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\n      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has\n      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely\n      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to\n      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to\n      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\n      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\n    ", "6": "\n      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for\n      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just\n      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this\n      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side\n      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a\n      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the\n      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed\n      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It\n      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;\n      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would\n      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm\n      Whale\u2019s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if\n      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\n      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme\n      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\n    ", "7": "\n      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You\n      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell\n      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle\n      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of\n      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be\n      undecided as to what it is precisely.\n    ", "8": "\n      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\n      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,\n      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his\n      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around\n      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops\n      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely\n      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those\n      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is\n      countersunk into the summit of the whale\u2019s head? For even when tranquilly\n      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump\n      sun-dried as a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then, the whale always\n      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you\n      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n    ", "9": "\n      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\n      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\n      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\n      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\n      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often\n      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing\n      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with\n      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I\n      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among\n      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another\n      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet\n      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the\n      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout\n      alone.\n    ", "10": "\n      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\n      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other\n      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the\n      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no\n      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is\n      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.\n      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads\n      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,\n      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible\n      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a\n      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before\n      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\n      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my\n      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin\n      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for\n      the above supposition.\n    ", "11": "\n      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\n      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\n      contemplations, and that vapor\u2014as you will sometimes see it\u2014glorified\n      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.

The\n      compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or\n      flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the\n      crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede\n      from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living\n      thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the\n      crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full\n      grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n    ", "2": "\n      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into\n      it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:\u2014upper,\n      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and\n      horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise\n      between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything\n      else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the\n      middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles\n      always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the\n      antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of\n      the masonry.\n    ", "3": "\n      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the\n      whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular\n      fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running\n      down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute\n      to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the\n      whole whale seems concentrated to a point.

Real strength never impairs beauty or\n      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,\n      strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that\n      all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its\n      charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the\n      naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the\n      man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.

Scroll-wise coiled\n      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this\n      which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when\n      furiously swimming.

On more accounts than\n      one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue\n      in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n      in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n    ", "10": "\n      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\n      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of\n      his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\n      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\n      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\n      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great\n      gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor\n      from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was\n      the smoke from the touch-hole.\n    ", "11": "\n      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie\n      considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of\n      sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps,\n      his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect\n      in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot\n      out of view. Excepting the sublime breach\u2014somewhere else to be\n      described\u2014this peaking of the whale\u2019s flukes is perhaps the grandest\n      sight to be seen in all animated nature.

Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from\n      New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in\n      all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having\n      seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry\n      them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer\u2014\u201cWell,\n      boys, here\u2019s the ark!\u201d\n     ", "5": "\n      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,\n      in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the\n      ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\n      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more\n      upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to\n      keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed\n      on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was\n      snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing\n      all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh\n      entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,\n      and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.\n    ", "6": "\n      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which\n      of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,\n      instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in\n      former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes\n      embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous\n      nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance\n      and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense\n      caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising\n      grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without\n      being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what\n      sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\n    ", "7": "\n      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\n      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\n      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\n      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\n      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft\n      drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the\n      Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising\n      and falling away to leeward.\n    ", "8": "\n      Seen from the Pequod\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the\n      sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,\n      and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the\n      thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy\n      autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\n    ", "9": "\n      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\n      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\n      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;\n      even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through\n      the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and\n      swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\n    ", "10": "\n      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling\n      their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended\n      boats.

As\n      with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn\n      beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty\n      pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he\n      glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was\n      then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to\n      his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both\n      chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd\n      of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally\n      cheering him on with their curses;\u2014when all these conceits had\n      passed through his brain, Ahab\u2019s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the\n      black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being\n      able to drag the firm thing from its place.\n    ", "13": "\n      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,\n      after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at\n      last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging\n      at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to\n      grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to\n      rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But\n      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating\n      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,\n      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by\n      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\n      the three keels that were after them,\u2014though as yet a mile in their\n      rear,\u2014than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\n      battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked\n      bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n    ", "14": "\n      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\n      several hours\u2019 pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\n      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they\n      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\n      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say\n      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto\n      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;\n      and like King Porus\u2019 elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast\n      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their\n      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.\n      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,\n      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged\n      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of\n      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could\n      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\n      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding\n      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have\n      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when\n      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre\u2019s pit, they will, at the\n      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\n      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before\n      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\n      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n    ", "15": "\n      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet\n      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\n      retreated, but collectively remained in one place.

In about three minutes\u2019 time,\n      Queequeg\u2019s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in\n      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for\n      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale\n      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed\n      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the\n      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.

Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty\n      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting\n      part of the business. \u201cOut of the way, Commodore!\u201d cried one, to a great\n      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant\n      threatened to swamp us. \u201cHard down with your tail, there!\u201d cried a second\n      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself\n      with his own fan-like extremity.\n    ", "18": "\n      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by\n      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal\n      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other\u2019s grain\n      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the\n      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can\n      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales\n      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than\n      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day\n      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you\n      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these\n      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of\n      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales\n      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of\n      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and\n      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the\n      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in\n      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\n      boat\u2019s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came\n      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts\n      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n    ", "19": "\n      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not\n      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale\u2019s way greatly diminished;\n      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference\n      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last\n      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;\n      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between\n      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain\n      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the\n      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In\n      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,\n      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in\n      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they\n      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted\n      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw\n      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and\n      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder\n      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\n      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density\n      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed\n      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.\n      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall\n      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of\n      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the\n      women and children of this routed host.\n    ", "20": "\n      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any\n      one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the\n      whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.\n      At any rate\u2014though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n      deceptive\u2014spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\n      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\n      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked\n      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had\n      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;\n      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and\n      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales\u2014now\n      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake\u2014evinced\n      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic\n      which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came\n      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it\n      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg\n      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but\n      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.\n    ", "21": "\n      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in\n      those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\n      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\n      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\n      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly\n      and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives\n      at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still\n      spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;\u2014even so did\n      the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if\n      we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their\n      sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little\n      infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might\n      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He\n      was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\n      from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\n      reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the\n      unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar\u2019s bow.

Not\n      seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the\n      maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub\n      is thereby trapped.

But the sight of the enraged\n      drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,\n      was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when\n      fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to\n      hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic\n      tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which\n      is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we\n      afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had\n      broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon\n      line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing\n      among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\n      battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\n    ", "29": "\n      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\n      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire\n      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening\n      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the\n      unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in\n      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the\n      cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that\n      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his\n      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that\n      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently\n      flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\n      wounding and murdering his own comrades.\n    ", "30": "\n      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\n      fright.

By the time they have lounged up and down\n      the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in\n      anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive\n      temperature of the year.\n    ", "4": "\n      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\n      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\n      interesting family.

For amber, though at times found on\n      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris\n      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,\n      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,\n      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,\n      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it\n      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter\u2019s\n      in Rome.

How to cure such a\n      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat\n      loads of Brandreth\u2019s pills, and then running out of harm\u2019s way, as\n      laborers do in blasting rocks.\n    ", "2": "\n      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain\n      hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors\u2019\n      trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more\n      than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\n    ", "3": "\n      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found\n      in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?

Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been\n      disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy\n      business. But there is another thing to rebut.

Now how did this odious stigma originate?\n    ", "5": "\n      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\n      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\n      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\n      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it\n      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and\n      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any\n      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and\n      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is\n      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city\n      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.\n    ", "6": "\n      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\n      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,\n      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place\n      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being\n      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,\n      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation\n      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite\n      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\n      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,\n      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that\n      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or\n      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of\n      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor\n      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a\n      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;\n      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,\n      that the motion of a Sperm Whale\u2019s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,\n      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor.

As a general thing,\n      these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats\u2019\n      crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous\n      wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was\n      so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by\n      abbreviation.

But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and\n      torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom\n      very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his\n      tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,\n      freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year\u2019s calendar should\n      show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New\n      Year\u2019s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was\n      brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous\n      ebony, panelled in king\u2019s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life\u2019s\n      peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had\n      somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his\n      brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily\n      subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange\n      wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural\n      lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once\n      enlivened many a fiddler\u2019s frolic on the green; and at melodious\n      even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one\n      star-belled tambourine.

Then come out\n      those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,\n      once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\n      stolen from the King of Hell.

The involuntary\n      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the\n      boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against\n      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in\n      it, when at last plumping into the water.

Tranquilly permitting these irregular\n      cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still\n      half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially\n      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,\n      Pip, except\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice\n      ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in\n      whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still\n      better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give\n      undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n      margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and\n      concluded with a peremptory command, \u201cStick to the boat, Pip, or by the\n      Lord, I won\u2019t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can\u2019t afford to lose\n      whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you\n      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don\u2019t jump any more.\u201d\n       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,\n      yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes\n      with his benevolence.\n    ", "9": "\n      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.

Alas!\n      Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue\n      day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all\n      round, to the horizon, like gold-beater\u2019s skin hammered out to the\n      extremest.

In\n      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.\n      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black\n      head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the\n      brightest.\n    ", "10": "\n      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.

By the merest\n      chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little\n      negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The\n      sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his\n      soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous\n      depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and\n      fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\n      hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,\n      Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the\n      firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God\u2019s foot upon the\n      treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him\n      mad. So man\u2019s insanity is heaven\u2019s sense; and wandering from all mortal\n      reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\n      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent\n      as his God.\n    ", "13": "\n      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.

In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,\n      shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains\n      considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.\n      Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once\n      ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would\n      that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and\n      inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the\n      time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk\n      in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day\n      of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\n    ", "5": "\n      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\n      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\n      darkness was intense.

So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold\n      Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets\n      of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them\n      in conflagrations.\n    ", "6": "\n      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth\n      in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\n      harpooneers, always the whale-ship\u2019s stokers. With huge pronged poles they\n      pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up\n      the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors\n      to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every\n      pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all\n      eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on\n      the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served\n      for a sea-sofa.

As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their\n      tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter\n      forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and\n      fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge\n      pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and\n      the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\n      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\n      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all\n      sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with\n      fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness,\n      seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander\u2019s soul.\n    ", "7": "\n      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\n      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.

So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship\n      of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now\n      found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly\n      eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\n    ", "6": "\n      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.

This was\n      quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his\n      solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the\n      fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the\n      word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own\n      weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the\n      tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently\n      landed upon the capstan head.

": {"0": "\n      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\n      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant\n      of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &\n      Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not far behind\n      the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real\n      historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this\n      great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not\n      make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships\n      that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years\n      previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and\n      the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the\n      North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,\n      that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with\n      civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they\n      were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.\n    ", "1": "\n      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and\n      at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and\n      was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the\n      great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to\n      her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia\u2019s example\n      was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast\n      Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with\n      this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and\n      all his Sons\u2014how many, their mother only knows\u2014and under their\n      immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British\n      government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling\n      voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain,\n      the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much\n      does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a\n      discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote\n      waters of Japan. That ship\u2014well called the \u201cSyren\u201d\u2014made a\n      noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling\n      Ground first became generally known.

However, the masts did not go\n      overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass\n      the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle\n      scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.\n    ", "4": "\n      The beef was fine\u2014tough, but with body in it.

For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship\n      scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English,\n      this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental\n      and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is\n      here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.\n    ", "7": "\n      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\n      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must\n      be about whalers.

I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous\n      natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their\n      vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid\n      Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\n      convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\n    ", "11": "\n      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.

Now, whether\n      these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have\n      been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat\u2019s head, and take\n      good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they\n      did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it\n      remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\n      Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer\n      sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might\n      ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\n    ", "12": "\n      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\n      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers\n      have not neglected so excellent an example.

Ahab\u2019s Leg. ": {"0": "\n      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\n      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his\n      own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that\n      his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after\n      gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently\n      wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever,\n      something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already\n      shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it\n      still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem\n      it entirely trustworthy.\n    ", "1": "\n      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\n      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\n      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\n      been very long prior to the Pequod\u2019s sailing from Nantucket, that he had\n      been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some\n      unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb\n      having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and\n      all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the\n      agonizing wound was entirely cured.\n    ", "2": "\n      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the\n      anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a\n      former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous\n      reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest\n      songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable\n      events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought\n      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the\n      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an\n      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural\n      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,\n      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all\n      hell\u2019s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely\n      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the\n      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the\n      deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest\n      earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in\n      them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some\n      men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie\n      the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\n      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\n      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\n      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the\n      gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in\n      the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.\n    ", "3": "\n      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\n      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other\n      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why\n      it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of\n      the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like\n      exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it\n      were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg\u2019s bruited reason\n      for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching\n      all Ahab\u2019s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant\n      darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this\n      one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his\n      temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,\n      dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a\n      less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted\n      casualty\u2014remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab\u2014invested\n      itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and\n      of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so\n      far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;\n      and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did\n      it transpire upon the Pequod\u2019s decks.\n    ", "4": "\n      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or\n      the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with\n      earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain\n      practical procedures;\u2014he called the carpenter.\n    ", "5": "\n      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay\n      set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied\n      with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus\n      far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of\n      the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the\n      carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to\n      provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the\n      distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship\u2019s forge was ordered to be\n      hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the\n      affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of\n      whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\n    ", "6": "\n\n \n"}, " CHAPTER 107.

But, besides the application to him of the generic\n      remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in\n      those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a\n      large ship, upon a three or four years\u2019 voyage, in uncivilized and\n      far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:\u2014repairing\n      stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,\n      inserting bull\u2019s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,\n      and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special\n      business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of\n      conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\n    ", "2": "\n      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\n      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\n      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.

An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a\n      soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the\n      blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the\n      carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy\n      to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has\n      the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his\n      bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces\n      under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden\n      vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have\n      him draw the tooth.\n    ", "4": "\n      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and\n      without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed\n      but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now\n      upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness\n      of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon\n      vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man\n      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;\n      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of\n      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the\n      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,\n      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig\n      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,\n      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;\u2014yet\n      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,\n      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled\n      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight\n      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah\u2019s ark. Was it that this old\n      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,\n      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever\n      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\n      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\n      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You\n      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a\n      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to\n      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been\n      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but\n      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a\n      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed\n      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those\n      unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield\n      contrivances, assuming the exterior\u2014though a little swelled\u2014of\n      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,\n      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\n      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the\n      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of\n      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,\n      and there they were.\n    ", "5": "\n      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was,\n      after all, no mere machine of an automaton.

Sleeping? aye, but still alive,\n      and soon awake again. I can\u2019t withstand thee, then, old man.

The bluish pearl-white of the\n      inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab\u2019s head, and reached higher\n      than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as\n      a mildly cruel cat her mouse.

As now he thus\n      vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in,\n      collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding\n      further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast\n      again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.

By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\n      view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n    ", "29": "\n      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\n      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\n      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.\n      The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of\n      grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus\u2019s elephants in the book of\n      Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale\u2019s\n      insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,\u2014though he could\n      still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless\n      Ahab\u2019s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock\n      might burst. From the boat\u2019s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and\n      mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not\n      succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.

For such is the\n      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence\n      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;\n      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,\n      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the\n      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of\n      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.\n      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a\n      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly\n      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands\n      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present\n      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\n      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,\n      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through\n      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the\n      creature\u2019s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to\n      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot\u2019s coast is to him. So that\n      to this hunter\u2019s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing\n      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as\n      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\n      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\n      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby\u2019s pulse; and lightly\n      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,\n      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\n      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\n      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence\n      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this\n      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at\n      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman\u2019s\n      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is\n      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a\n      quarter from his port?

How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as\n      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to.
