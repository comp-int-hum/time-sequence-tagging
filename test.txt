He thus addressed him: \u201cSirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, \u201cI was not then born.\u201d Then said the Wolf, \u201cYou feed in my pasture.\u201d \u201cNo, good sir,\u201d replied the Lamb, \u201cI have not yet tasted grass.\u201d Again said the Wolf, \u201cYou drink of my well.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d exclaimed the Lamb, \u201cI never yet drank water, for as yet my mother\u2019s milk is both food and drink to me.\u201d Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, \u201cWell! I won\u2019t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.\u201d The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny."}, "The Bat And The Weasels": {"0": "A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.", "1": "It is wise to turn circumstances to good account."}, "The Ass And The Grasshopper": {"0": "AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices.

Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: \u201cIf you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.\u201d The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:", "1": "\u201cYou ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\u201d"}, "The Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller": {"0": "A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened.

When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons\u2019 hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: \u201cMy sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.\u201d"}, "The Boy Hunting Locusts": {"0": "A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him.

I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.\u201d"}, "The Kingdom of the Lion": {"0": "THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, \u201cOh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.\u201d And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life."}, "The Wolf and the Crane": {"0": "A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: \u201cWhy, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.\u201d", "1": "In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains."}, "The Fisherman Piping": {"0": "A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: \u201cO you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.\u201d"}, "Hercules and the Wagoner": {"0": "A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed him: \u201cPut your shoulders to the wheels, my man.

A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, \u201cWhy did you not treasure up food during the summer?\u201d He replied, \u201cI had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.\u201d They then said in derision: \u201cIf you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.\u201d"}, "The Traveler and His Dog": {"0": "A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: \u201cWhy do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.\u201d The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: \u201cO, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.\u201d", "1": "The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend."}, "The Dog and the Shadow": {"0": "A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away."}, "The Mole and His Mother": {"0": "A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: \u201cI am sure than I can see, Mother!\u201d In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The young Mole said, \u201cIt is a pebble.\u201d His Mother exclaimed: \u201cMy son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.\u201d"}, "The Herdsman and the Lost Bull": {"0": "A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said: \u201cJust now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own escape from him in safety.\u201d"}, "The Hare and the Tortoise": {"0": "A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who replied, laughing: \u201cThough you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.\u201d The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.", "1": "Slow but steady wins the race."}, "The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble": {"0": "THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone: \u201cPray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain disputings.\u201d"}, "The Farmer and the Stork": {"0": "A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. \u201cPray save me, Master,\u201d he said, \u201cand let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers\u2014they are not the least like those of a Crane.\u201d The Farmer laughed aloud and said, \u201cIt may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.\u201d", "1": "Birds of a feather flock together."}, "The Farmer and the Snake": {"0": "ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. \u201cOh,\u201d cried the Farmer with his last breath, \u201cI am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.\u201d", "1": "The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful."}, "The Fawn and His Mother": {"0": "A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, \u201cYou are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?\u201d She smiled, and said: \u201cI know full well, my son, that all you say is true.

They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure."}, "The Tortoise and the Eagle": {"0": "A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. \u201cI will give you,\u201d she said, \u201call the riches of the Red Sea.\u201d \u201cI will teach you to fly then,\u201d said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to pieces.

Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated.

They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented \u201ca Lion strangled by a Man.\u201d The traveler pointed to it and said: \u201cSee there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.\u201d The Lion replied: \u201cThis statue was made by one of you men.

For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, \u201cIt is time for us to be off to Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.\u201d", "1": "If words suffice not, blows must follow."}, "The Dog in the Manger": {"0": "A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. \u201cWhat a selfish Dog!\u201d said one of them to his companions; \u201che cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.\u201d"}, "The Fox and the Goat": {"0": "A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. \u201cIf,\u201d said he, \u201cyou will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.\u201d The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat\u2019s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, \u201cYou foolish old fellow!

One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. \u201cHe gave me this advice,\u201d his companion replied. \u201cNever travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.\u201d", "1": "Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends."}, "The Oxen and the Axle-Trees": {"0": "A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.

Supposing that the Swan\u2019s splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools.

One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, \u201cPray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.\u201d"}, "The Sick Lion": {"0": "A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was. \u201cI am very middling,\u201d replied the Lion, \u201cbut why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said the Fox. \u201cI notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.\u201d", "1": "He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others."}, "The Horse and Groom": {"0": "A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit. \u201cAlas!\u201d said the Horse, \u201cif you really wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.\u201d"}, "The Ass and the Lapdog": {"0": "A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master\u2019s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: \u201cI have brought it all on myself!

The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both.

The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden.

The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure.

On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect work. They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision. Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with all. He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike. He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief. And, lastly, he inveighed against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus."}, "The Eagle and the Fox": {"0": "AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live near each other.

The Fox on her return, discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to avenge them. A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up."}, "The Man and the Satyr": {"0": "A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them.

The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. \u201cI can no longer consider you as a friend,\u201d said the Satyr, \u201ca fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.\u201d"}, "The Ass and His Purchaser": {"0": "A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that he should try out the animal before he bought him.

The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion. But entering a wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached himself: \u201cWoe is me! How I have deceived myself!

Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater.

The Wolf called out to him and said, \u201cThe Priest will slay you in sacrifice, if he should catch you.\u201d On which the Lamb replied, \u201cIt would be better for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by you.\u201d"}, "The Rich Man and the Tanner": {"0": "A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away. The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would leave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints."}, "The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea": {"0": "A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after his buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him: \u201cBlame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury.\u201d"}, "The Mules and the Robbers": {"0": "TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along. One carried panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to his neck. His companion followed with quiet and easy step. All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain. The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes. The other replied, \u201cI am indeed glad that I was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.\u201d"}, "The Viper and the File": {"0": "A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal. The File replied, \u201cYou must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return.\u201d"}, "The Lion and the Shepherd": {"0": "A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to say, \u201cI am a suppliant, and seek your aid.\u201d The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned \u201cto be cast to the Lions\u201d as the punishment for his imputed crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends."}, "The Camel and Jupiter": {"0": "THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors. He went to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears."}, "The Panther and the Shepherds": {"0": "A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: \u201cI remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.\u201d"}, "The Ass and the Charger": {"0": "AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard work. But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the very midst of the enemy. The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield. Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse."}, "The Eagle and His Captor": {"0": "AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief. Later, another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again. The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor. A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, \u201cDo not cultivate the favor of this man, but of your former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.\u201d"}, "The Bald Man and the Fly": {"0": "A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it, gave himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, \u201cYou who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?\u201d The Bald Man replied, \u201cI can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was no intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.\u201d"}, "The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree": {"0": "THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure it at all."}, "The Eagle and the Kite": {"0": "AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in company with a Kite. \u201cWhy,\u201d said the Kite, \u201cdo I see you with such a rueful look?\u201d \u201cI seek,\u201d she replied, \u201ca mate suitable for me, and am not able to find one.\u201d \u201cTake me,\u201d returned the Kite, \u201cI am much stronger than you are.\u201d \u201cWhy, are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder?\u201d \u201cWell, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons.\u201d The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, \u201cFly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me.\u201d The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it had lain about the fields. \u201cIs this,\u201d said the Eagle, \u201cthe faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?\u201d The Kite replied, \u201cThat I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the performance.\u201d"}, "The Ass and His Driver": {"0": "AN ASS, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and bolted to the brink of a deep precipice.

Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their complaint. One of them said, \u201cThe Sun, now while he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes. What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?\u201d"}, "LIFE OF AESOP": {"0": "The Life and History of \u00c6sop is involved, like that of Homer, the most famous of Greek poets, in much obscurity. Sardis, the capital of Lydia; Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient colony in Thrace; and Cotiaeum, the chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend for the distinction of being the birthplace of Aesop. Although the honor thus claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as established facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. He is, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave. He was owned by two masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon, the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning and wit. One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of Greece, was the permission to take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, like the philosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times, raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a position of high renown. In his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed, he travelled through many countries, and among others came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia, the great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men. He met at the court of Croesus with Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is related so to have pleased his royal master, by the part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers, that he applied to him an expression which has since passed into a proverb, \u201c\u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a6\u03c1\u1f7b\u03be.\u201d \u201cThe Phrygian has spoken better than all.\u201d", "1": "On the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of State. In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different petty republics of Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth, and at another in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his wise fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus. One of these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus, was the occasion of his death. Having been sent to Delphi with a large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and sent it back to his master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment, accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his sacred character as ambassador, executed him as a public criminal. This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged. The citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities, until they made a public reparation of their crime; and, \u201cThe blood of Aesop\u201d became a well-known adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished. Neither did the great fabulist lack posthumous honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at Athens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek sculptors. Phaedrus thus immortalizes the event:", "2": "Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici, Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi: Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam; Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.", "3": "These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. They were first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard Bachet de Mezeriac, who declined the honor of being tutor to Louis XIII of France, from his desire to devote himself exclusively to literature. He published his Life of Aesop, Anno Domini 1632. The later investigations of a host of English and German scholars have added very little to the facts given by M. Mezeriac. The substantial truth of his statements has been confirmed by later criticism and inquiry. It remains to state, that prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop was from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. His life was prefixed to all the early editions of these fables, and was republished as late as 1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of Aesop. This life by Planudes contains, however, so small an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque deformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally condemned as false, puerile, and unauthentic. 101 It is given up in the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the slightest credit. G.F.T."}, "PREFACE": {"0": "THE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular modes of conveying instruction. Each is distinguished by its own special characteristics. The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story either founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and not necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson. The Parable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer, or reader. The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from both of these. It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning, and that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful introduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to either Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or political truth. The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements, ever aims at one great end and purpose representation of human motive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser. Thus the superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy. The true fabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function. He is neither a narrator, nor an allegorist. He is a great teacher, a corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue. In this consists the superiority of the Fable over the Tale or the Parable. The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a merry guise, to convey instruction. Phaedrus, the great imitator of Aesop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true office of the writer of fables.", "1": "Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet, Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.", "2": "The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. \u201cThe fable,\u201d says Professor K. O. Mueller, \u201coriginated in Greece in an intentional travestie of human affairs. The \u2018ainos,\u2019 as its name denotes, is an admonition, or rather a reproof veiled, either from fear of an excess of frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and authentic account of the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same.\" 1", "3": "The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1) the narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a careful maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious personages introduced into it. The narration should relate to one simple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances. The moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven with, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation. The introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular consent. The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass patient. Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest observance of these rules. They are occupied with one short narrative, from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately associated. \u201c\u2018Tis the simple manner,\u201d says Dodsley, 2 \u201cin which the morals of Aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him, and gives him the preference over all other mythologists. His \u2018Mountain delivered of a Mouse,\u2019 produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall, as it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of flattery. There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of accumulated reflections.\" 3 An equal amount of praise is due for the consistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously introduced, are marked. While they are made to depict the motives and passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or rapacity.", "4": "These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all the fables in this collection. Many of them lack that unity of design, that close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice in the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and excellency of true Aesopian fable. This inferiority of some to others is sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of these fables. The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of Aesop. Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he lived. Thus, the fable of the \u201cHawk and the Nightingale\u201d is related by Hesiod; 4 the \u201cEagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own Feathers,\u201d by Aeschylus; 5 the \u201cFox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,\u201d by Archilochus. 6 Many of them again are of later origin, and are to be traced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection, though thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of Aesop, rightfully bears his name, because he composed so large a number (all framed in the same mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and stamped with the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to himself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables, and the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since borne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding ages, the position of the first of moralists. 7", "5": "The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and for a longtime were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition. Socrates ismentioned by Plato 8as having employed his time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacredship from Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning some ofthese fables into verse, but he thus versified only such as he remembered.Demetrius Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to havemade the first collection of these fables. Phaedrus, a slave by birth or bysubsequent misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a freedman,imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the commencement of theChristian era. Aphthonius, a rhetorician of Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatiseon, and converted into Latin prose, some of these fables. This translation isthe more worthy of notice, as it illustrates a custom of common use, both inthese and in later times. The rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed togive the Fables of Aesop as an exercise to their scholars, not only invitingthem to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practice and to perfectthemselves thereby in style and rules of grammar, by making for themselves newand various versions of the fables. Ausonius, 9the friend of the Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in theWestern Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse, which JulianusTitianus, a contemporary writer of no great name, translated into prose.Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius, put some of these fables into Latinelegiacs, which are given by Nevelet (in a book we shall refer to hereafter),and are occasionally incorporated with the editions of Phaedrus.", "6": "Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables of Aesop. During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors were the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an Asiatic court, that we next find honors paid to the name and memory of Aesop. Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a collection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables. Little is known of his history. Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in his monastery. He took an active part in public affairs. In 1327 A.D. he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the Emperor Andronicus the Elder. This brought him into immediate contact with the Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of the Eastern Church. Planudes has been exposed to a two-fold accusation. He is charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of Babrias (to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of this Preface), and to have had the bad taste \u201cto transpose,\u201d or to turn his poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to have himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name of the famous Greek fabulist. The truth lies between these two extremes. Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted some that were current in his day; but there is an abundance of unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with the veritable fables of Aesop, although the versions he had access to were probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers. His collection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source or foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the learned.", "7": "The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop to their high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked for in the West rather than in the East. The calamities gradually thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D. combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning in Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest in the Fables of Aesop is closely identified. These fables, indeed, were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted attention. They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and the ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of that day. Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Aesop.", "8": "These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended circulation by the agency of the printing press. Bonus Accursius, as early as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by Planudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into English, and printed at his press in West-minster Abbey, 1485. 10 It must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent traces of its influence on these fables, 11 by causing the interpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which were so frequently introduced into the public discourses of the great preachers of those days, and of which specimens are yet to be found in the extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette. 12 The publication of this era which most probably has influenced these fables, is the \u201cLiber Facetiarum,\" 13 a book consisting of a hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from which the two fables of the \u201cMiller, his Son, and the Ass,\u201d and the \u201cFox and the Woodcutter,\u201d are undoubtedly selected.", "9": "The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany, and their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to them by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the Romish ecclesiastics. The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an active part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found time, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the students in the university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor. Martin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the celebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I, king of Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Aesop next after the Holy Scriptures. In 1546 A.D. the second printed edition of the collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from the printing-press of Robert Stephens, in which were inserted some additional fables from a MS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.", "10": "The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables of Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the early part of the seventeenth century. In the year 1610, a learned Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of these fables, in a work entitled \u201cMythologia Aesopica.\u201d This was a noble effort to do honor to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect collection of Aesopian fables ever yet published. It consisted, in addition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in the various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables (never before published) from MSS. in the Library of the Vatican, of forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias. It also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phaedrus, Avienus, and other authors. This volume of Nevelet forms a complete \u201cCorpus Fabularum Aesopicarum;\u201d and to his labors Aesop owes his restoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great teachers of mankind. During the interval of three centuries which has elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet\u2019s, no book, with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation than Aesop\u2019s Fables. They have been translated into the greater number of the languages both of Europe and of the East, and have been read, and will be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan, and Christian. They are, at the present time, not only engrafted into the literature of the civilized world, but are familiar as household words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of all countries.", "11": "This collection of Nevelet\u2019s is the great culminating point in the history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian Fables. It is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea, which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of circumstances. Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named Babrias would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of Aesopian Fables. This intimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a full understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with the writings that bear his name.", "12": "The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might not unfitlybe enumerated among the curiosities of literature. He is generally supposed tohave been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the Ionic Colonies, but the exactperiod in which he lived and wrote is yet unsettled. He is placed, by onecritic,14as far back as the institution of the Achaian League, B.C. 250; by another aslate as the Emperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him acontemporary with Phaedrus in the time of Augustus. At whatever time he wrotehis version of Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirelydisappeared, and to have been lost sight of. His name is mentioned by Avienus;by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of the eleventh century, who givesin his lexicon several isolated verses of his version of the fables; and byJohn Tzetzes, a grammarian and poet of Constantinople, who lived during thelatter half of the twelfth century. Nevelet, in the preface to the volume whichwe have described, points out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the workof Aesop, as they contain a reference in two places to \u201cHolymonks,\u201d and give a verse from the Epistle of St. James as an\u201cEpimith\u201d to one of the fables, and suggests Babrias as theirauthor. Francis Vavassor,15a learned French jesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, andproduced further proofs from internal evidence, from the use of the wordPiraeus in describing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not given tilltwo hundred years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern words,that many of these fables must have been at least committed to writingposterior to the time of Aesop, and more boldly suggests Babrias as theirauthor or collector.16These various references to Babrias induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at the closeof the seventeenth century, to examine more minutely the existing versions ofAesop\u2019s Fables, and he maintained that many of them could, with a slightchange of words, be resolved into the Scazonic17iambics, in which Babrias is known to have written: and, with a greater freedomthan the evidence then justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claimto the exclusive authorship of these fables. Such a seemingly extravaganttheory, thus roundly asserted, excited much opposition. Dr. Bentley18met with an able antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford, the Hon.Mr. Charles Boyle,19afterwards Earl of Orrery. Their letters and disputations on this subject,enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning, will ever bear aconspicuous place in the literary history of the seventeenth century. Thearguments of Dr. Bentley were yet further defended a few years later by Mr.Thomas Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions thathe might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. Mr.Tyrwhitt published, A.D. 1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a collection ofhis fables in choliambic meter found in a MS. in the Bodleian Library atOxford. Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian, contributed further testimony tothe correctness of the supposition that Babrias had made a veritable collectionof fables by printing from a MS. contained in the Vatican library severalfables never before published. In the year 1844, however, new and unexpectedlight was thrown upon this subject. A veritable copy of Babrias was found in amanner as singular as were the MSS. of Quinctilian\u2019s Institutes, and ofCicero\u2019s Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St. Gall A.D. 1416. M.Menoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction toKing Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a commission to search for ancientMSS., and in carrying out his instructions he found a MS. at the convent of St.Laura, on Mount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected andwished-for choliambic version of Babrias. This MS. was found to be divided intotwo books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five, and the otherninety-five fables. This discovery attracted very general attention, not onlyas confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures so boldly made by a longchain of critics, but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures tendingto establish the reputation, and to confirm the antiquity and authenticity ofthe great mass of Aesopian Fable. The Fables thus recovered were soonpublished. They found a most worthy editor in the late distinguished Sir GeorgeCornewall Lewis, and a translator equally qualified for his task, in theReverend James Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, andhimself a relation of their English editor. Thus, after an eclipse of manycenturies, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable collector ofveritable Aesopian Fables.", "13": "The following are the sources from which the present translation hasbeen prepared: Babrii Fabulae Aesopeae.

Because its performance is not personal. It is the result of the law of construction. It is not a merit that it does the things which it is set to do\u2014it can't help doing them.", "35": "O.M. And it is not a personal demerit in the stone machine that it does so little?", "36": "Y.M. Certainly not. It does no more and no less than the law of its make permits and compels it to do. There is nothing personal about it; it cannot choose. In this process of \u201cworking up to the matter\u201d is it your idea to work up to the proposition that man and a machine are about the same thing, and that there is no personal merit in the performance of either?", "37": "O.M. Yes\u2014but do not be offended; I am meaning no offense. What makes the grand difference between the stone engine and the steel one? Shall we call it training, education? Shall we call the stone engine a savage and the steel one a civilized man? The original rock contained the stuff of which the steel one was built\u2014but along with a lot of sulphur and stone and other obstructing inborn heredities, brought down from the old geologic ages\u2014prejudices, let us call them. Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove. Will you take note of that phrase?", "38": "Y.M. Yes. I have written it down; \u201cPrejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove.\u201d Go on.", "39": "O.M. Prejudices must be removed by outside influences or not at all. Put that down.", "40": "Y.M. Very well; \u201cMust be removed by outside influences or not at all.\u201d Go on.", "41": "O.M. The iron's prejudice against ridding itself of the cumbering rock. To make it more exact, the iron's absolute indifference as to whether the rock be removed or not. Then comes the outside influence and grinds the rock to powder and sets the ore free. The iron in the ore is still captive. An outside influence smelts it free of the clogging ore. The iron is emancipated iron, now, but indifferent to further progress. An outside influence beguiles it into the Bessemer furnace and refines it into steel of the first quality. It is educated, now\u2014its training is complete. And it has reached its limit. By no possible process can it be educated into gold. Will you set that down?", "42": "Y.M. Yes. \u201cEverything has its limit\u2014iron ore cannot be educated into gold.\u201d", "43": "O.M. There are gold men, and tin men, and copper men, and leaden men, and steel men, and so on\u2014and each has the limitations of his nature, his heredities, his training, and his environment. You can build engines out of each of these metals, and they will all perform, but you must not require the weak ones to do equal work with the strong ones. In each case, to get the best results, you must free the metal from its obstructing prejudicial ones by education\u2014smelting, refining, and so forth.", "44": "Y.M. You have arrived at man, now?", "45": "O.M. Yes. Man the machine\u2014man the impersonal engine. Whatsoever a man is, is due to his make, and to the influences brought to bear upon it by his heredities, his habitat, his associations. He is moved, directed, commanded, by exterior influences\u2014solely. He originates nothing, not even a thought.", "46": "Y.M. Oh, come! Where did I get my opinion that this which you are talking is all foolishness?", "47": "O.M. It is a quite natural opinion\u2014indeed an inevitable opinion\u2014but you did not create the materials out of which it is formed. They are odds and ends of thoughts, impressions, feelings, gathered unconsciously from a thousand books, a thousand conversations, and from streams of thought and feeling which have flowed down into your heart and brain out of the hearts and brains of centuries of ancestors. Personally you did not create even the smallest microscopic fragment of the materials out of which your opinion is made; and personally you cannot claim even the slender merit of putting the borrowed materials together. That was done automatically\u2014by your mental machinery, in strict accordance with the law of that machinery's construction. And you not only did not make that machinery yourself, but you have not even any command over it.", "48": "Y.M. This is too much. You think I could have formed no opinion but that one?", "49": "O.M. Spontaneously? No. And you did not form that one; your machinery did it for you\u2014automatically and instantly, without reflection or the need of it.", "50": "Y.M. Suppose I had reflected? How then?", "51": "O.M. Suppose you try?", "52": "Y.M. (After a quarter of an hour.) I have reflected.", "53": "O.M. You mean you have tried to change your opinion\u2014as an experiment?", "54": "Y.M. Yes.", "55": "O.M. With success?", "56": "Y.M. No. It remains the same; it is impossible to change it.", "57": "O.M. I am sorry, but you see, yourself, that your mind is merely a machine, nothing more. You have no command over it, it has no command over itself\u2014it is worked solely from the outside. That is the law of its make; it is the law of all machines.", "58": "Y.M. Can't I ever change one of these automatic opinions?", "59": "O.M. No. You can't yourself, but exterior influences can do it.", "60": "Y.M. And exterior ones only?", "61": "O.M. Yes\u2014exterior ones only.", "62": "Y.M. That position is untenable\u2014I may say ludicrously untenable.", "63": "O.M. What makes you think so?", "64": "Y.M. I don't merely think it, I know it. Suppose I resolve to enter upon a course of thought, and study, and reading, with the deliberate purpose of changing that opinion; and suppose I succeed. That is not the work of an exterior impulse, the whole of it is mine and personal; for I originated the project.", "65": "O.M. Not a shred of it. It grew out of this talk with me. But for that it would not have occurred to you. No man ever originates anything. All his thoughts, all his impulses, come from the outside.", "66": "Y.M. It's an exasperating subject. The first man had original thoughts, anyway; there was nobody to draw from.", "67": "O.M. It is a mistake. Adam's thoughts came to him from the outside. You have a fear of death. You did not invent that\u2014you got it from outside, from talking and teaching. Adam had no fear of death\u2014none in the world.", "68": "Y.M. Yes, he had.", "69": "O.M. When he was created?", "70": "Y.M. No.", "71": "O.M. When, then?", "72": "Y.M. When he was threatened with it.", "73": "O.M. Then it came from outside. Adam is quite big enough; let us not try to make a god of him. None but gods have ever had a thought which did not come from the outside. Adam probably had a good head, but it was of no sort of use to him until it was filled up from the outside. He was not able to invent the triflingest little thing with it. He had not a shadow of a notion of the difference between good and evil\u2014he had to get the idea from the outside. Neither he nor Eve was able to originate the idea that it was immodest to go naked; the knowledge came in with the apple from the outside. A man's brain is so constructed that it can originate nothing whatsoever. It can only use material obtained outside. It is merely a machine; and it works automatically, not by will-power. It has no command over itself, its owner has no command over it.", "74": "Y.M. Well, never mind Adam: but certainly Shakespeare's creations\u2014", "75": "O.M. No, you mean Shakespeare's imitations. Shakespeare created nothing. He correctly observed, and he marvelously painted. He exactly portrayed people whom God had created; but he created none himself. Let us spare him the slander of charging him with trying. Shakespeare could not create. He was a machine, and machines do not create.", "76": "Y.M. Where was his excellence, then?", "77": "O.M. In this. He was not a sewing-machine, like you and me; he was a Gobelin loom. The threads and the colors came into him from the outside; outside influences, suggestions, experiences (reading, seeing plays, playing plays, borrowing ideas, and so on), framed the patterns in his mind and started up his complex and admirable machinery, and it automatically turned out that pictured and gorgeous fabric which still compels the astonishment of the world. If Shakespeare had been born and bred on a barren and unvisited rock in the ocean his mighty intellect would have had no outside material to work with, and could have invented none; and no outside influences, teachings, moldings, persuasions, inspirations, of a valuable sort, and could have invented none; and so Shakespeare would have produced nothing. In Turkey he would have produced something\u2014something up to the highest limit of Turkish influences, associations, and training. In France he would have produced something better\u2014something up to the highest limit of the French influences and training. In England he rose to the highest limit attainable through the outside helps afforded by that land's ideals, influences, and training. You and I are but sewing-machines. We must turn out what we can; we must do our endeavor and care nothing at all when the unthinking reproach us for not turning out Gobelins.", "78": "Y.M. And so we are mere machines! And machines may not boast, nor feel proud of their performance, nor claim personal merit for it, nor applause and praise. It is an infamous doctrine.", "79": "O.M. It isn't a doctrine, it is merely a fact.", "80": "Y.M. I suppose, then, there is no more merit in being brave than in being a coward?", "81": "O.M. Personal merit? No. A brave man does not create his bravery. He is entitled to no personal credit for possessing it. It is born to him. A baby born with a billion dollars\u2014where is the personal merit in that? A baby born with nothing\u2014where is the personal demerit in that? The one is fawned upon, admired, worshiped, by sycophants, the other is neglected and despised\u2014where is the sense in it?", "82": "Y.M. Sometimes a timid man sets himself the task of conquering his cowardice and becoming brave\u2014and succeeds. What do you say to that?", "83": "O.M. That it shows the value of training in right directions over training in wrong ones. Inestimably valuable is training, influence, education, in right directions\u2014training one's self-approbation to elevate its ideals.", "84": "Y.M. But as to merit\u2014the personal merit of the victorious coward's project and achievement?", "85": "O.M. There isn't any. In the world's view he is a worthier man than he was before, but he didn't achieve the change\u2014the merit of it is not his.", "86": "Y.M. Whose, then?", "87": "O.M. His make, and the influences which wrought upon it from the outside.", "88": "Y.M. His make?", "89": "O.M. To start with, he was not utterly and completely a coward, or the influences would have had nothing to work upon. He was not afraid of a cow, though perhaps of a bull: not afraid of a woman, but afraid of a man. There was something to build upon. There was a seed. No seed, no plant. Did he make that seed himself, or was it born in him? It was no merit of his that the seed was there.", "90": "Y.M. Well, anyway, the idea of cultivating it, the resolution to cultivate it, was meritorious, and he originated that.", "91": "O.M. He did nothing of the kind. It came whence all impulses, good or bad, come\u2014from outside. If that timid man had lived all his life in a community of human rabbits, had never read of brave deeds, had never heard speak of them, had never heard any one praise them nor express envy of the heroes that had done them, he would have had no more idea of bravery than Adam had of modesty, and it could never by any possibility have occurred to him to resolve to become brave. He could not originate the idea\u2014it had to come to him from the outside. And so, when he heard bravery extolled and cowardice derided, it woke him up. He was ashamed. Perhaps his sweetheart turned up her nose and said, \u201cI am told that you are a coward!\u201d It was not he that turned over the new leaf\u2014she did it for him. He must not strut around in the merit of it \u2014it is not his.", "92": "Y.M. But, anyway, he reared the plant after she watered the seed.", "93": "O.M. No. Outside influences reared it. At the command\u2014and trembling\u2014he marched out into the field\u2014with other soldiers and in the daytime, not alone and in the dark. He had the influence of example, he drew courage from his comrades' courage; he was afraid, and wanted to run, but he did not dare; he was afraid to run, with all those soldiers looking on. He was progressing, you see\u2014the moral fear of shame had risen superior to the physical fear of harm. By the end of the campaign experience will have taught him that not all who go into battle get hurt\u2014an outside influence which will be helpful to him; and he will also have learned how sweet it is to be praised for courage and be huzza'd at with tear-choked voices as the war-worn regiment marches past the worshiping multitude with flags flying and the drums beating. After that he will be as securely brave as any veteran in the army\u2014and there will not be a shade nor suggestion of personal merit in it anywhere; it will all have come from the outside. The Victoria Cross breeds more heroes than\u2014", "94": "Y.M. Hang it, where is the sense in his becoming brave if he is to get no credit for it?", "95": "O.M. Your question will answer itself presently. It involves an important detail of man's make which we have not yet touched upon.", "96": "Y.M. What detail is that?", "97": "O.M. The impulse which moves a person to do things\u2014the only impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing.", "98": "Y.M. The only one! Is there but one?", "99": "O.M. That is all. There is only one.", "100": "Y.M. Well, certainly that is a strange enough doctrine. What is the sole impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing?", "101": "O.M. The impulse to content his own spirit\u2014the necessity of contenting his own spirit and winning its approval.", "102": "Y.M. Oh, come, that won't do!", "103": "O.M. Why won't it?", "104": "Y.M. Because it puts him in the attitude of always looking out for his own comfort and advantage; whereas an unselfish man often does a thing solely for another person's good when it is a positive disadvantage to himself.", "105": "O.M. It is a mistake. The act must do him good, first; otherwise he will not do it. He may think he is doing it solely for the other person's sake, but it is not so; he is contenting his own spirit first\u2014the other's person's benefit has to always take second place.", "106": "Y.M. What a fantastic idea! What becomes of self\u2014sacrifice? Please answer me that.", "107": "O.M. What is self-sacrifice?", "108": "Y.M. The doing good to another person where no shadow nor suggestion of benefit to one's self can result from it.", "109": "Old Man. There have been instances of it\u2014you think?", "110": "Young Man. Instances? Millions of them!", "111": "O.M. You have not jumped to conclusions? You have examined them\u2014critically?", "112": "Y.M. They don't need it: the acts themselves reveal the golden impulse back of them.", "113": "O.M. For instance?", "114": "Y.M. Well, then, for instance. Take the case in the book here. The man lives three miles up-town. It is bitter cold, snowing hard, midnight. He is about to enter the horse-car when a gray and ragged old woman, a touching picture of misery, puts out her lean hand and begs for rescue from hunger and death. The man finds that he has a quarter in his pocket, but he does not hesitate: he gives it her and trudges home through the storm. There\u2014it is noble, it is beautiful; its grace is marred by no fleck or blemish or suggestion of self-interest.", "115": "O.M. What makes you think that?", "116": "Y.M. Pray what else could I think? Do you imagine that there is some other way of looking at it?", "117": "O.M. Can you put yourself in the man's place and tell me what he felt and what he thought?", "118": "Y.M. Easily. The sight of that suffering old face pierced his generous heart with a sharp pain. He could not bear it. He could endure the three-mile walk in the storm, but he could not endure the tortures his conscience would suffer if he turned his back and left that poor old creature to perish. He would not have been able to sleep, for thinking of it.", "119": "O.M. What was his state of mind on his way home?", "120": "Y.M. It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows. His heart sang, he was unconscious of the storm.", "121": "O.M. He felt well?", "122": "Y.M. One cannot doubt it.", "123": "O.M. Very well. Now let us add up the details and see how much he got for his twenty-five cents. Let us try to find out the real why of his making the investment. In the first place he couldn't bear the pain which the old suffering face gave him. So he was thinking of his pain\u2014this good man. He must buy a salve for it. If he did not succor the old woman his conscience would torture him all the way home. Thinking of his pain again. He must buy relief for that. If he didn't relieve the old woman he would not get any sleep. He must buy some sleep\u2014still thinking of himself, you see. Thus, to sum up, he bought himself free of a sharp pain in his heart, he bought himself free of the tortures of a waiting conscience, he bought a whole night's sleep\u2014all for twenty-five cents! It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself. On his way home his heart was joyful, and it sang\u2014profit on top of profit! The impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was\u2014first\u2014to content his own spirit; secondly to relieve her sufferings. Is it your opinion that men's acts proceed from one central and unchanging and inalterable impulse, or from a variety of impulses?", "124": "Y.M. From a variety, of course\u2014some high and fine and noble, others not. What is your opinion?", "125": "O.M. Then there is but one law, one source.", "126": "Y.M. That both the noblest impulses and the basest proceed from that one source?", "127": "O.M. Yes.", "128": "Y.M. Will you put that law into words?", "129": "O.M. Yes. This is the law, keep it in your mind. From his cradle to his grave a man never does a single thing which has any FIRST AND FOREMOST object but one\u2014to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort, for HIMSELF.", "130": "Y.M. Come! He never does anything for any one else's comfort, spiritual or physical?", "131": "O.M. No. except on those distinct terms\u2014that it shall first secure his own spiritual comfort. Otherwise he will not do it.", "132": "Y.M. It will be easy to expose the falsity of that proposition.", "133": "O.M. For instance?", "134": "Y.M. Take that noble passion, love of country, patriotism. A man who loves peace and dreads pain, leaves his pleasant home and his weeping family and marches out to manfully expose himself to hunger, cold, wounds, and death. Is that seeking spiritual comfort?", "135": "O.M. He loves peace and dreads pain?", "136": "Y.M. Yes.", "137": "O.M. Then perhaps there is something that he loves more than he loves peace\u2014the approval of his neighbors and the public. And perhaps there is something which he dreads more than he dreads pain\u2014the disapproval of his neighbors and the public. If he is sensitive to shame he will go to the field\u2014not because his spirit will be entirely comfortable there, but because it will be more comfortable there than it would be if he remained at home. He will always do the thing which will bring him the most mental comfort\u2014for that is the sole law of his life. He leaves the weeping family behind; he is sorry to make them uncomfortable, but not sorry enough to sacrifice his own comfort to secure theirs.", "138": "Y.M. Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid and peaceful man to\u2014", "139": "O.M. Go to war? Yes\u2014public opinion can force some men to do anything.", "140": "Y.M. Anything?", "141": "O.M. Yes\u2014anything.", "142": "Y.M. I don't believe that. Can it force a right-principled man to do a wrong thing?", "143": "O.M. Yes.", "144": "Y.M. Can it force a kind man to do a cruel thing?", "145": "O.M. Yes.", "146": "Y.M. Give an instance.", "147": "O.M. Alexander Hamilton was a conspicuously high-principled man. He regarded dueling as wrong, and as opposed to the teachings of religion\u2014but in deference to public opinion he fought a duel. He deeply loved his family, but to buy public approval he treacherously deserted them and threw his life away, ungenerously leaving them to lifelong sorrow in order that he might stand well with a foolish world. In the then condition of the public standards of honor he could not have been comfortable with the stigma upon him of having refused to fight. The teachings of religion, his devotion to his family, his kindness of heart, his high principles, all went for nothing when they stood in the way of his spiritual comfort. A man will do anything, no matter what it is, to secure his spiritual comfort; and he can neither be forced nor persuaded to any act which has not that goal for its object. Hamilton's act was compelled by the inborn necessity of contenting his own spirit; in this it was like all the other acts of his life, and like all the acts of all men's lives. Do you see where the kernel of the matter lies? A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval. He will secure the largest share possible of that, at all costs, all sacrifices.", "148": "Y.M. A minute ago you said Hamilton fought that duel to get public approval.", "149": "O.M. I did. By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his family's approval and a large share of his own; but the public approval was more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together\u2014in the earth or above it; to secure that would furnish him the most comfort of mind, the most self\u2014approval; so he sacrificed all other values to get it.", "150": "Y.M. Some noble souls have refused to fight duels, and have manfully braved the public contempt.", "151": "O.M. They acted according to their make. They valued their principles and the approval of their families above the public approval. They took the thing they valued most and let the rest go. They took what would give them the largest share of personal contentment and approval\u2014a man always does. Public opinion cannot force that kind of men to go to the wars. When they go it is for other reasons. Other spirit-contenting reasons.", "152": "Y.M. Always spirit-contenting reasons?", "153": "O.M. There are no others.", "154": "Y.M. When a man sacrifices his life to save a little child from a burning building, what do you call that?", "155": "O.M. When he does it, it is the law of his make. He can't bear to see the child in that peril (a man of a different make could), and so he tries to save the child, and loses his life. But he has got what he was after\u2014his own approval.", "156": "Y.M. What do you call Love, Hate, Charity, Revenge, Humanity, Magnanimity, Forgiveness?", "157": "O.M. Different results of the one Master Impulse: the necessity of securing one's self approval. They wear diverse clothes and are subject to diverse moods, but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the same person all the time. To change the figure, the compulsion that moves a man\u2014and there is but the one\u2014is the necessity of securing the contentment of his own spirit. When it stops, the man is dead.", "158": "Y.M. That is foolishness. Love\u2014", "159": "O.M. Why, love is that impulse, that law, in its most uncompromising form. It will squander life and everything else on its object. Not primarily for the object's sake, but for its own. When its object is happy it is happy\u2014and that is what it is unconsciously after.", "160": "Y.M. You do not even except the lofty and gracious passion of mother-love?", "161": "O.M. No, it is the absolute slave of that law. The mother will go naked to clothe her child; she will starve that it may have food; suffer torture to save it from pain; die that it may live. She takes a living pleasure in making these sacrifices. She does it for that reward\u2014that self-approval, that contentment, that peace, that comfort. She would do it for your child IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY.", "162": "Y.M. This is an infernal philosophy of yours.", "163": "O.M. It isn't a philosophy, it is a fact.", "164": "Y.M. Of course you must admit that there are some acts which\u2014", "165": "O.M. No. There is no act, large or small, fine or mean, which springs from any motive but the one\u2014the necessity of appeasing and contenting one's own spirit.", "166": "Y.M. The world's philanthropists\u2014", "167": "O.M. I honor them, I uncover my head to them\u2014from habit and training; and they could not know comfort or happiness or self-approval if they did not work and spend for the unfortunate. It makes them happy to see others happy; and so with money and labor they buy what they are after\u2014happiness, self-approval. Why don't miners do the same thing? Because they can get a thousandfold more happiness by not doing it. There is no other reason. They follow the law of their make.", "168": "Y.M. What do you say of duty for duty's sake?", "169": "O.M. That it does not exist. Duties are not performed for duty's sake, but because their neglect would make the man uncomfortable. A man performs but one duty\u2014the duty of contenting his spirit, the duty of making himself agreeable to himself. If he can most satisfyingly perform this sole and only duty by helping his neighbor, he will do it; if he can most satisfyingly perform it by swindling his neighbor, he will do it. But he always looks out for Number One\u2014first; the effects upon others are a secondary matter. Men pretend to self-sacrifices, but this is a thing which, in the ordinary value of the phrase, does not exist and has not existed. A man often honestly thinks he is sacrificing himself merely and solely for some one else, but he is deceived; his bottom impulse is to content a requirement of his nature and training, and thus acquire peace for his soul.", "170": "Y.M. Apparently, then, all men, both good and bad ones, devote their lives to contenting their consciences.", "171": "O.M. Yes. That is a good enough name for it: Conscience\u2014that independent Sovereign, that insolent absolute Monarch inside of a man who is the man's Master. There are all kinds of consciences, because there are all kinds of men. You satisfy an assassin's conscience in one way, a philanthropist's in another, a miser's in another, a burglar's in still another. As a guide or incentive to any authoritatively prescribed line of morals or conduct (leaving training out of the account), a man's conscience is totally valueless. I know a kind-hearted Kentuckian whose self-approval was lacking\u2014whose conscience was troubling him, to phrase it with exactness\u2014because he had neglected to kill a certain man\u2014a man whom he had never seen. The stranger had killed this man's friend in a fight, this man's Kentucky training made it a duty to kill the stranger for it. He neglected his duty\u2014kept dodging it, shirking it, putting it off, and his unrelenting conscience kept persecuting him for this conduct. At last, to get ease of mind, comfort, self-approval, he hunted up the stranger and took his life. It was an immense act of self-sacrifice (as per the usual definition), for he did not want to do it, and he never would have done it if he could have bought a contented spirit and an unworried mind at smaller cost. But we are so made that we will pay anything for that contentment\u2014even another man's life.", "172": "Y.M. You spoke a moment ago of trained consciences. You mean that we are not born with consciences competent to guide us aright?", "173": "O.M. If we were, children and savages would know right from wrong, and not have to be taught it.", "174": "Y.M. But consciences can be trained?", "175": "O.M. Yes.", "176": "Y.M. Of course by parents, teachers, the pulpit, and books.", "177": "O.M. Yes\u2014they do their share; they do what they can.", "178": "Y.M. And the rest is done by\u2014", "179": "O.M. Oh, a million unnoticed influences\u2014for good or bad: influences which work without rest during every waking moment of a man's life, from cradle to grave.", "180": "Y.M. You have tabulated these?", "181": "O.M. Many of them\u2014yes.", "182": "Y.M. Will you read me the result?", "183": "O.M. Another time, yes. It would take an hour.", "184": "Y.M. A conscience can be trained to shun evil and prefer good?", "185": "O.M. Yes.", "186": "Y.M. But will it for spirit-contenting reasons only?", "187": "O.M. It can't be trained to do a thing for any other reason. The thing is impossible.", "188": "Y.M. There must be a genuinely and utterly self-sacrificing act recorded in human history somewhere.", "189": "O.M. You are young. You have many years before you. Search one out.", "190": "Y.M. It does seem to me that when a man sees a fellow-being struggling in the water and jumps in at the risk of his life to save him\u2014", "191": "O.M. Wait. Describe the man. Describe the fellow-being. State if there is an audience present; or if they are alone.", "192": "Y.M. What have these things to do with the splendid act?", "193": "O.M. Very much. Shall we suppose, as a beginning, that the two are alone, in a solitary place, at midnight?", "194": "Y.M. If you choose.", "195": "O.M. And that the fellow-being is the man's daughter?", "196": "Y.M. Well, n-no\u2014make it someone else.", "197": "O.M. A filthy, drunken ruffian, then?", "198": "Y.M. I see. Circumstances alter cases. I suppose that if there was no audience to observe the act, the man wouldn't perform it.", "199": "O.M. But there is here and there a man who would. People, for instance, like the man who lost his life trying to save the child from the fire; and the man who gave the needy old woman his twenty-five cents and walked home in the storm\u2014there are here and there men like that who would do it. And why? Because they couldn't bear to see a fellow-being struggling in the water and not jump in and help. It would give them pain. They would save the fellow-being on that account. They wouldn't do it otherwise. They strictly obey the law which I have been insisting upon. You must remember and always distinguish the people who can't bear things from people who can. It will throw light upon a number of apparently \u201cself-sacrificing\u201d cases.", "200": "Y.M. Oh, dear, it's all so disgusting.", "201": "O.M. Yes. And so true.", "202": "Y.M. Come\u2014take the good boy who does things he doesn't want to do, in order to gratify his mother.", "203": "O.M. He does seven-tenths of the act because it gratifies him to gratify his mother. Throw the bulk of advantage the other way and the good boy would not do the act. He must obey the iron law. None can escape it.", "204": "Y.M. Well, take the case of a bad boy who\u2014", "205": "O.M. You needn't mention it, it is a waste of time. It is no matter about the bad boy's act. Whatever it was, he had a spirit-contenting reason for it. Otherwise you have been misinformed, and he didn't do it.", "206": "Y.M. It is very exasperating. A while ago you said that man's conscience is not a born judge of morals and conduct, but has to be taught and trained. Now I think a conscience can get drowsy and lazy, but I don't think it can go wrong; if you wake it up\u2014", "207": "A Little Story", "208": "O.M. I will tell you a little story:", "209": "Once upon a time an Infidel was guest in the house of a Christian widow whose little boy was ill and near to death. The Infidel often watched by the bedside and entertained the boy with talk, and he used these opportunities to satisfy a strong longing in his nature\u2014that desire which is in us all to better other people's condition by having them think as we think. He was successful. But the dying boy, in his last moments, reproached him and said:", "210": "\u201cI believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and my comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the things which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have lost.\u201d", "211": "And the mother, also, reproached the Infidel, and said:", "212": "\u201cMy child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do this cruel thing? We have done you no harm, but only kindness; we made our house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our reward.\u201d", "213": "The heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:", "214": "\u201cIt was wrong\u2014I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good. In my view he was in error; it seemed my duty to teach him the truth.\u201d", "215": "Then the mother said:", "216": "\u201cI had taught him, all his little life, what I believed to be the truth, and in his believing faith both of us were happy. Now he is dead,\u2014and lost; and I am miserable. Our faith came down to us through centuries of believing ancestors; what right had you, or any one, to disturb it? Where was your honor, where was your shame?\u201d", "217": "Y.M. He was a miscreant, and deserved death!", "218": "O.M. He thought so himself, and said so.", "219": "Y.M. Ah\u2014you see, his conscience was awakened!", "220": "O.M. Yes, his Self-Disapproval was. It pained him to see the mother suffer. He was sorry he had done a thing which brought him pain. It did not occur to him to think of the mother when he was misteaching the boy, for he was absorbed in providing pleasure for himself, then. Providing it by satisfying what he believed to be a call of duty.", "221": "Y.M. Call it what you please, it is to me a case of awakened conscience. That awakened conscience could never get itself into that species of trouble again. A cure like that is a permanent cure.", "222": "O.M. Pardon\u2014I had not finished the story. We are creatures of outside influences\u2014we originate nothing within. Whenever we take a new line of thought and drift into a new line of belief and action, the impulse is always suggested from the outside. Remorse so preyed upon the Infidel that it dissolved his harshness toward the boy's religion and made him come to regard it with tolerance, next with kindness, for the boy's sake and the mother's. Finally he found himself examining it. From that moment his progress in his new trend was steady and rapid. He became a believing Christian. And now his remorse for having robbed the dying boy of his faith and his salvation was bitterer than ever. It gave him no rest, no peace. He must have rest and peace\u2014it is the law of nature. There seemed but one way to get it; he must devote himself to saving imperiled souls. He became a missionary. He landed in a pagan country ill and helpless. A native widow took him into her humble home and nursed him back to convalescence. Then her young boy was taken hopelessly ill, and the grateful missionary helped her tend him. Here was his first opportunity to repair a part of the wrong done to the other boy by doing a precious service for this one by undermining his foolish faith in his false gods. He was successful. But the dying boy in his last moments reproached him and said:", "223": "\u201cI believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and my comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the things which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have lost.\u201d", "224": "And the mother, also, reproached the missionary, and said:", "225": "\u201cMy child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do this cruel thing? We had done you no harm, but only kindness; we made our house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our reward.\u201d", "226": "The heart of the missionary was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:", "227": "\u201cIt was wrong\u2014I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good.

Where was your honor, where was your shame?\u201d", "230": "The missionary's anguish of remorse and sense of treachery were as bitter and persecuting and unappeasable, now, as they had been in the former case. The story is finished. What is your comment?", "231": "Y.M. The man's conscience is a fool! It was morbid. It didn't know right from wrong.", "232": "O.M. I am not sorry to hear you say that. If you grant that one man's conscience doesn't know right from wrong, it is an admission that there are others like it. This single admission pulls down the whole doctrine of infallibility of judgment in consciences. Meantime there is one thing which I ask you to notice.", "233": "Y.M. What is that?", "234": "O.M. That in both cases the man's act gave him no spiritual discomfort, and that he was quite satisfied with it and got pleasure out of it. But afterward when it resulted in pain to him, he was sorry. Sorry it had inflicted pain upon the others, but for no reason under the sun except that their pain gave him pain. Our consciences take no notice of pain inflicted upon others until it reaches a point where it gives pain to us. In all cases without exception we are absolutely indifferent to another person's pain until his sufferings make us uncomfortable. Many an infidel would not have been troubled by that Christian mother's distress. Don't you believe that?", "235": "Y.M. Yes. You might almost say it of the average infidel, I think.", "236": "O.M. And many a missionary, sternly fortified by his sense of duty, would not have been troubled by the pagan mother's distress\u2014Jesuit missionaries in Canada in the early French times, for instance; see episodes quoted by Parkman.", "237": "Y.M. Well, let us adjourn. Where have we arrived?", "238": "O.M. At this. That we (mankind) have ticketed ourselves with a number of qualities to which we have given misleading names. Love, Hate, Charity, Compassion, Avarice, Benevolence, and so on. I mean we attach misleading meanings to the names. They are all forms of self-contentment, self-gratification, but the names so disguise them that they distract our attention from the fact. Also we have smuggled a word into the dictionary which ought not to be there at all\u2014Self-Sacrifice. It describes a thing which does not exist. But worst of all, we ignore and never mention the Sole Impulse which dictates and compels a man's every act: the imperious necessity of securing his own approval, in every emergency and at all costs. To it we owe all that we are. It is our breath, our heart, our blood. It is our only spur, our whip, our goad, our only impelling power; we have no other. Without it we should be mere inert images, corpses; no one would do anything, there would be no progress, the world would stand still. We ought to stand reverently uncovered when the name of that stupendous power is uttered.", "239": "Y.M. I am not convinced.", "240": "O.M. You will be when you think.", "241": "Old Man. Have you given thought to the Gospel of Self\u2014Approval since we talked?", "242": "Young Man. I have.", "243": "O.M. It was I that moved you to it. That is to say an outside influence moved you to it\u2014not one that originated in your head. Will you try to keep that in mind and not forget it?", "244": "Y.M. Yes. Why?", "245": "O.M. Because by and by in one of our talks, I wish to further impress upon you that neither you, nor I, nor any man ever originates a thought in his own head. The utterer of a thought always utters a second-hand one.", "246": "Y.M. Oh, now\u2014", "247": "O.M. Wait. Reserve your remark till we get to that part of our discussion\u2014tomorrow or next day, say. Now, then, have you been considering the proposition that no act is ever born of any but a self-contenting impulse\u2014(primarily). You have sought. What have you found?", "248": "Y.M. I have not been very fortunate. I have examined many fine and apparently self-sacrificing deeds in romances and biographies, but\u2014", "249": "O.M. Under searching analysis the ostensible self-sacrifice disappeared? It naturally would.", "250": "Y.M. But here in this novel is one which seems to promise. In the Adirondack woods is a wage-earner and lay preacher in the lumber-camps who is of noble character and deeply religious. An earnest and practical laborer in the New York slums comes up there on vacation\u2014he is leader of a section of the University Settlement. Holme, the lumberman, is fired with a desire to throw away his excellent worldly prospects and go down and save souls on the East Side. He counts it happiness to make this sacrifice for the glory of God and for the cause of Christ. He resigns his place, makes the sacrifice cheerfully, and goes to the East Side and preaches Christ and Him crucified every day and every night to little groups of half-civilized foreign paupers who scoff at him. But he rejoices in the scoffings, since he is suffering them in the great cause of Christ. You have so filled my mind with suspicions that I was constantly expecting to find a hidden questionable impulse back of all this, but I am thankful to say I have failed. This man saw his duty, and for duty's sake he sacrificed self and assumed the burden it imposed.", "251": "O.M. Is that as far as you have read?", "252": "Y.M. Yes.", "253": "O.M. Let us read further, presently. Meantime, in sacrificing himself\u2014not for the glory of God, primarily, as he imagined, but first to content that exacting and inflexible master within him\u2014did he sacrifice anybody else?", "254": "Y.M. How do you mean?", "255": "O.M. He relinquished a lucrative post and got mere food and lodging in place of it. Had he dependents?", "256": "Y.M. Well\u2014yes.", "257": "O.M. In what way and to what extend did his self-sacrifice affect them?", "258": "Y.M. He was the support of a superannuated father. He had a young sister with a remarkable voice\u2014he was giving her a musical education, so that her longing to be self-supporting might be gratified. He was furnishing the money to put a young brother through a polytechnic school and satisfy his desire to become a civil engineer.", "259": "O.M. The old father's comforts were now curtailed?", "260": "Y.M. Quite seriously. Yes.", "261": "O.M. The sister's music-lessens had to stop?", "262": "Y.M. Yes.", "263": "O.M. The young brother's education\u2014well, an extinguishing blight fell upon that happy dream, and he had to go to sawing wood to support the old father, or something like that?", "264": "Y.M. It is about what happened. Yes.", "265": "O.M. What a handsome job of self-sacrificing he did do! It seems to me that he sacrificed everybody except himself. Haven't I told you that no man ever sacrifices himself; that there is no instance of it upon record anywhere; and that when a man's Interior Monarch requires a thing of its slave for either its momentary or its permanent contentment, that thing must and will be furnished and that command obeyed, no matter who may stand in the way and suffer disaster by it? That man ruined his family to please and content his Interior Monarch\u2014", "266": "Y.M. And help Christ's cause.", "267": "O.M. Yes\u2014secondly. Not firstly. He thought it was firstly.", "268": "Y.M. Very well, have it so, if you will. But it could be that he argued that if he saved a hundred souls in New York\u2014", "269": "O.M. The sacrifice of the family would be justified by that great profit upon the\u2014the\u2014what shall we call it?", "270": "Y.M. Investment?", "271": "O.M. Hardly. How would speculation do? How would gamble do? Not a solitary soul-capture was sure. He played for a possible thirty-three-hundred-per-cent profit. It was gambling\u2014with his family for \u201cchips.\u201d However let us see how the game came out. Maybe we can get on the track of the secret original impulse, the real impulse, that moved him to so nobly self\u2014sacrifice his family in the Savior's cause under the superstition that he was sacrificing himself. I will read a chapter or so.... Here we have it! It was bound to expose itself sooner or later. He preached to the East-Side rabble a season, then went back to his old dull, obscure life in the lumber-camps \u201churt to the heart, his pride humbled.\u201d Why? Were not his efforts acceptable to the Savior, for Whom alone they were made? Dear me, that detail is lost sight of, is not even referred to, the fact that it started out as a motive is entirely forgotten! Then what is the trouble? The authoress quite innocently and unconsciously gives the whole business away. The trouble was this: this man merely preached to the poor; that is not the University Settlement's way; it deals in larger and better things than that, and it did not enthuse over that crude Salvation-Army eloquence. It was courteous to Holme\u2014but cool. It did not pet him, did not take him to its bosom. \u201cPerished were all his dreams of distinction, the praise and grateful approval\u2014\u201d Of whom? The Savior? No; the Savior is not mentioned. Of whom, then? Of \u201chis fellow-workers.\u201d Why did he want that? Because the Master inside of him wanted it, and would not be content without it. That emphasized sentence quoted above, reveals the secret we have been seeking, the original impulse, the real impulse, which moved the obscure and unappreciated Adirondack lumberman to sacrifice his family and go on that crusade to the East Side\u2014which said original impulse was this, to wit: without knowing it he went there to show a neglected world the large talent that was in him, and rise to distinction. As I have warned you before, no act springs from any but the one law, the one motive. But I pray you, do not accept this law upon my say-so; but diligently examine for yourself. Whenever you read of a self-sacrificing act or hear of one, or of a duty done for duty's sake, take it to pieces and look for the real motive. It is always there.", "272": "Y.M. I do it every day. I cannot help it, now that I have gotten started upon the degrading and exasperating quest. For it is hatefully interesting!\u2014in fact, fascinating is the word. As soon as I come across a golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it, I cannot help myself.", "273": "O.M. Have you ever found one that defeated the rule?", "274": "Y.M. No\u2014at least, not yet. But take the case of servant\u2014tipping in Europe. You pay the hotel for service; you owe the servants nothing, yet you pay them besides. Doesn't that defeat it?", "275": "O.M. In what way?", "276": "Y.M. You are not obliged to do it, therefore its source is compassion for their ill-paid condition, and\u2014", "277": "O.M. Has that custom ever vexed you, annoyed you, irritated you?", "278": "Y.M. Well, yes.", "279": "O.M. Still you succumbed to it?", "280": "Y.M. Of course.", "281": "O.M. Why of course?", "282": "Y.M. Well, custom is law, in a way, and laws must be submitted to\u2014everybody recognizes it as a duty.", "283": "O.M. Then you pay for the irritating tax for duty's sake?", "284": "Y.M. I suppose it amounts to that.", "285": "O.M. Then the impulse which moves you to submit to the tax is not all compassion, charity, benevolence?", "286": "Y.M. Well\u2014perhaps not.", "287": "O.M. Is any of it?", "288": "Y.M. I\u2014perhaps I was too hasty in locating its source.", "289": "O.M. Perhaps so. In case you ignored the custom would you get prompt and effective service from the servants?", "290": "Y.M. Oh, hear yourself talk! Those European servants? Why, you wouldn't get any at all, to speak of.", "291": "O.M. Couldn't that work as an impulse to move you to pay the tax?", "292": "Y.M. I am not denying it.", "293": "O.M. Apparently, then, it is a case of for-duty's-sake with a little self-interest added?", "294": "Y.M. Yes, it has the look of it. But here is a point: we pay that tax knowing it to be unjust and an extortion; yet we go away with a pain at the heart if we think we have been stingy with the poor fellows; and we heartily wish we were back again, so that we could do the right thing, and more than the right thing, the generous thing. I think it will be difficult for you to find any thought of self in that impulse.", "295": "O.M. I wonder why you should think so. When you find service charged in the hotel bill does it annoy you?", "296": "Y.M. No.", "297": "O.M. Do you ever complain of the amount of it?", "298": "Y.M. No, it would not occur to me.", "299": "O.M. The expense, then, is not the annoying detail. It is a fixed charge, and you pay it cheerfully, you pay it without a murmur. When you came to pay the servants, how would you like it if each of the men and maids had a fixed charge?", "300": "Y.M. Like it? I should rejoice!", "301": "O.M. Even if the fixed tax were a shade more than you had been in the habit of paying in the form of tips?", "302": "Y.M. Indeed, yes!", "303": "O.M. Very well, then. As I understand it, it isn't really compassion nor yet duty that moves you to pay the tax, and it isn't the amount of the tax that annoys you. Yet something annoys you. What is it?", "304": "Y.M. Well, the trouble is, you never know what to pay, the tax varies so, all over Europe.", "305": "O.M. So you have to guess?", "306": "Y.M. There is no other way. So you go on thinking and thinking, and calculating and guessing, and consulting with other people and getting their views; and it spoils your sleep nights, and makes you distraught in the daytime, and while you are pretending to look at the sights you are only guessing and guessing and guessing all the time, and being worried and miserable.", "307": "O.M. And all about a debt which you don't owe and don't have to pay unless you want to! Strange. What is the purpose of the guessing?", "308": "Y.M. To guess out what is right to give them, and not be unfair to any of them.", "309": "O.M. It has quite a noble look\u2014taking so much pains and using up so much valuable time in order to be just and fair to a poor servant to whom you owe nothing, but who needs money and is ill paid.", "310": "Y.M. I think, myself, that if there is any ungracious motive back of it it will be hard to find.", "311": "O.M. How do you know when you have not paid a servant fairly?", "312": "Y.M. Why, he is silent; does not thank you. Sometimes he gives you a look that makes you ashamed. You are too proud to rectify your mistake there, with people looking, but afterward you keep on wishing and wishing you had done it. My, the shame and the pain of it! Sometimes you see, by the signs, that you have it just right, and you go away mightily satisfied. Sometimes the man is so effusively thankful that you know you have given him a good deal more than was necessary.", "313": "O.M. Necessary? Necessary for what?", "314": "Y.M. To content him.", "315": "O.M. How do you feel then?", "316": "Y.M. Repentant.", "317": "O.M. It is my belief that you have not been concerning yourself in guessing out his just dues, but only in ciphering out what would content him. And I think you have a self-deluding reason for that.", "318": "Y.M. What was it?", "319": "O.M. If you fell short of what he was expecting and wanting, you would get a look which would shame you before folk. That would give you pain. You\u2014for you are only working for yourself, not him. If you gave him too much you would be ashamed of yourself for it, and that would give you pain\u2014another case of thinking of yourself, protecting yourself, saving yourself from discomfort. You never think of the servant once\u2014except to guess out how to get his approval. If you get that, you get your own approval, and that is the sole and only thing you are after. The Master inside of you is then satisfied, contented, comfortable; there was no other thing at stake, as a matter of first interest, anywhere in the transaction.", "320": "Further Instances", "321": "Y.M. Well, to think of it; Self-Sacrifice for others, the grandest thing in man, ruled out! non-existent!", "322": "O.M. Are you accusing me of saying that?", "323": "Y.M. Why, certainly.", "324": "O.M. I haven't said it.", "325": "Y.M. What did you say, then?", "326": "O.M. That no man has ever sacrificed himself in the common meaning of that phrase\u2014which is, self-sacrifice for another alone. Men make daily sacrifices for others, but it is for their own sake first. The act must content their own spirit first. The other beneficiaries come second.", "327": "Y.M. And the same with duty for duty's sake?", "328": "O.M. Yes. No man performs a duty for mere duty's sake; the act must content his spirit first. He must feel better for doing the duty than he would for shirking it. Otherwise he will not do it.", "329": "Y.M. Take the case of the Berkeley Castle.", "330": "O.M. It was a noble duty, greatly performed. Take it to pieces and examine it, if you like.", "331": "Y.M. A British troop-ship crowded with soldiers and their wives and children. She struck a rock and began to sink. There was room in the boats for the women and children only. The colonel lined up his regiment on the deck and said \u201cit is our duty to die, that they may be saved.\u201d There was no murmur, no protest. The boats carried away the women and children. When the death-moment was come, the colonel and his officers took their several posts, the men stood at shoulder-arms, and so, as on dress-parade, with their flag flying and the drums beating, they went down, a sacrifice to duty for duty's sake. Can you view it as other than that?", "332": "O.M. It was something as fine as that, as exalted as that. Could you have remained in those ranks and gone down to your death in that unflinching way?", "333": "Y.M. Could I? No, I could not.", "334": "O.M. Think. Imagine yourself there, with that watery doom creeping higher and higher around you.", "335": "Y.M. I can imagine it. I feel all the horror of it. I could not have endured it, I could not have remained in my place. I know it.", "336": "O.M. Why?", "337": "Y.M. There is no why about it: I know myself, and I know I couldn't do it.", "338": "O.M. But it would be your duty to do it.", "339": "Y.M. Yes, I know\u2014but I couldn't.", "340": "O.M. It was more than thousand men, yet not one of them flinched. Some of them must have been born with your temperament; if they could do that great duty for duty's sake, why not you? Don't you know that you could go out and gather together a thousand clerks and mechanics and put them on that deck and ask them to die for duty's sake, and not two dozen of them would stay in the ranks to the end?", "341": "Y.M. Yes, I know that.", "342": "O.M. But you train them, and put them through a campaign or two; then they would be soldiers; soldiers, with a soldier's pride, a soldier's self-respect, a soldier's ideals. They would have to content a soldier's spirit then, not a clerk's, not a mechanic's. They could not content that spirit by shirking a soldier's duty, could they?", "343": "Y.M. I suppose not.", "344": "O.M. Then they would do the duty not for the duty's sake, but for their own sake\u2014primarily. The duty was just the same, and just as imperative, when they were clerks, mechanics, raw recruits, but they wouldn't perform it for that. As clerks and mechanics they had other ideals, another spirit to satisfy, and they satisfied it. They had to; it is the law. Training is potent. Training toward higher and higher, and ever higher ideals is worth any man's thought and labor and diligence.", "345": "Y.M. Consider the man who stands by his duty and goes to the stake rather than be recreant to it.", "346": "O.M. It is his make and his training. He has to content the spirit that is in him, though it cost him his life. Another man, just as sincerely religious, but of different temperament, will fail of that duty, though recognizing it as a duty, and grieving to be unequal to it: but he must content the spirit that is in him\u2014he cannot help it. He could not perform that duty for duty's sake, for that would not content his spirit, and the contenting of his spirit must be looked to first. It takes precedence of all other duties.", "347": "Y.M. Take the case of a clergyman of stainless private morals who votes for a thief for public office, on his own party's ticket, and against an honest man on the other ticket.", "348": "O.M. He has to content his spirit. He has no public morals; he has no private ones, where his party's prosperity is at stake. He will always be true to his make and training.", "349": "Young Man. You keep using that word\u2014training. By it do you particularly mean\u2014", "350": "Old Man. Study, instruction, lectures, sermons? That is a part of it\u2014but not a large part. I mean all the outside influences. There are a million of them. From the cradle to the grave, during all his waking hours, the human being is under training. In the very first rank of his trainers stands association. It is his human environment which influences his mind and his feelings, furnishes him his ideals, and sets him on his road and keeps him in it. If he leave[s] that road he will find himself shunned by the people whom he most loves and esteems, and whose approval he most values. He is a chameleon; by the law of his nature he takes the color of his place of resort. The influences about him create his preferences, his aversions, his politics, his tastes, his morals, his religion. He creates none of these things for himself. He thinks he does, but that is because he has not examined into the matter. You have seen Presbyterians?", "351": "Y.M. Many.", "352": "O.M. How did they happen to be Presbyterians and not Congregationalists? And why were the Congregationalists not Baptists, and the Baptists Roman Catholics, and the Roman Catholics Buddhists, and the Buddhists Quakers, and the Quakers Episcopalians, and the Episcopalians Millerites and the Millerites Hindus, and the Hindus Atheists, and the Atheists Spiritualists, and the Spiritualists Agnostics, and the Agnostics Methodists, and the Methodists Confucians, and the Confucians Unitarians, and the Unitarians Mohammedans, and the Mohammedans Salvation Warriors, and the Salvation Warriors Zoroastrians, and the Zoroastrians Christian Scientists, and the Christian Scientists Mormons\u2014and so on?", "353": "Y.M. You may answer your question yourself.", "354": "O.M. That list of sects is not a record of studies, searchings, seekings after light; it mainly (and sarcastically) indicates what association can do. If you know a man's nationality you can come within a split hair of guessing the complexion of his religion: English\u2014Protestant; American\u2014ditto; Spaniard, Frenchman, Irishman, Italian, South American\u2014Roman Catholic; Russian\u2014Greek Catholic; Turk\u2014Mohammedan; and so on. And when you know the man's religious complexion, you know what sort of religious books he reads when he wants some more light, and what sort of books he avoids, lest by accident he get more light than he wants. In America if you know which party-collar a voter wears, you know what his associations are, and how he came by his politics, and which breed of newspaper he reads to get light, and which breed he diligently avoids, and which breed of mass-meetings he attends in order to broaden his political knowledge, and which breed of mass-meetings he doesn't attend, except to refute its doctrines with brickbats. We are always hearing of people who are around seeking after truth. I have never seen a (permanent) specimen. I think he had never lived. But I have seen several entirely sincere people who thought they were (permanent) Seekers after Truth. They sought diligently, persistently, carefully, cautiously, profoundly, with perfect honesty and nicely adjusted judgment\u2014until they believed that without doubt or question they had found the Truth. That was the end of the search. The man spent the rest of his life hunting up shingles wherewith to protect his Truth from the weather. If he was seeking after political Truth he found it in one or another of the hundred political gospels which govern men in the earth; if he was seeking after the Only True Religion he found it in one or another of the three thousand that are on the market. In any case, when he found the Truth he sought no further; but from that day forth, with his soldering-iron in one hand and his bludgeon in the other he tinkered its leaks and reasoned with objectors. There have been innumerable Temporary Seekers of Truth\u2014have you ever heard of a permanent one? In the very nature of man such a person is impossible. However, to drop back to the text\u2014training: all training is one form or another of outside influence, and association is the largest part of it. A man is never anything but what his outside influences have made him. They train him downward or they train him upward\u2014but they train him; they are at work upon him all the time.", "355": "Y.M. Then if he happen by the accidents of life to be evilly placed there is no help for him, according to your notions\u2014he must train downward.", "356": "O.M. No help for him? No help for this chameleon? It is a mistake. It is in his chameleonship that his greatest good fortune lies. He has only to change his habitat\u2014his associations. But the impulse to do it must come from the outside \u2014he cannot originate it himself, with that purpose in view. Sometimes a very small and accidental thing can furnish him the initiatory impulse and start him on a new road, with a new idea. The chance remark of a sweetheart, \u201cI hear that you are a coward,\u201d may water a seed that shall sprout and bloom and flourish, and ended in producing a surprising fruitage\u2014in the fields of war. The history of man is full of such accidents. The accident of a broken leg brought a profane and ribald soldier under religious influences and furnished him a new ideal. From that accident sprang the Order of the Jesuits, and it has been shaking thrones, changing policies, and doing other tremendous work for two hundred years\u2014and will go on. The chance reading of a book or of a paragraph in a newspaper can start a man on a new track and make him renounce his old associations and seek new ones that are in sympathy with his new ideal: and the result, for that man, can be an entire change of his way of life.", "357": "Y.M. Are you hinting at a scheme of procedure?", "358": "O.M. Not a new one\u2014an old one. Old as mankind.", "359": "Y.M. What is it?", "360": "O.M. Merely the laying of traps for people. Traps baited with initiatory impulses toward high ideals. It is what the tract-distributor does. It is what the missionary does. It is what governments ought to do.", "361": "Y.M. Don't they?", "362": "O.M. In one way they do, in another they don't. They separate the smallpox patients from the healthy people, but in dealing with crime they put the healthy into the pest-house along with the sick. That is to say, they put the beginners in with the confirmed criminals. This would be well if man were naturally inclined to good, but he isn't, and so association makes the beginners worse than they were when they went into captivity. It is putting a very severe punishment upon the comparatively innocent at times. They hang a man\u2014which is a trifling punishment; this breaks the hearts of his family\u2014which is a heavy one. They comfortably jail and feed a wife-beater, and leave his innocent wife and family to starve.", "363": "Y.M. Do you believe in the doctrine that man is equipped with an intuitive perception of good and evil?", "364": "O.M. Adam hadn't it.", "365": "Y.M. But has man acquired it since?", "366": "O.M. No. I think he has no intuitions of any kind. He gets all his ideas, all his impressions, from the outside. I keep repeating this, in the hope that I may impress it upon you that you will be interested to observe and examine for yourself and see whether it is true or false.", "367": "Y.M. Where did you get your own aggravating notions?", "368": "O.M. From the outside. I did not invent them. They are gathered from a thousand unknown sources. Mainly unconsciously gathered.", "369": "Y.M. Don't you believe that God could make an inherently honest man?", "370": "O.M. Yes, I know He could. I also know that He never did make one.", "371": "Y.M. A wiser observer than you has recorded the fact that \u201can honest man's the noblest work of God.\u201d", "372": "O.M. He didn't record a fact, he recorded a falsity. It is windy, and sounds well, but it is not true. God makes a man with honest and dishonest possibilities in him and stops there. The man's associations develop the possibilities\u2014the one set or the other. The result is accordingly an honest man or a dishonest one.", "373": "Y.M. And the honest one is not entitled to\u2014", "374": "O.M. Praise? No. How often must I tell you that? He is not the architect of his honesty.", "375": "Y.M. Now then, I will ask you where there is any sense in training people to lead virtuous lives. What is gained by it?", "376": "O.M. The man himself gets large advantages out of it, and that is the main thing\u2014to him. He is not a peril to his neighbors, he is not a damage to them\u2014and so they get an advantage out of his virtues. That is the main thing to them. It can make this life comparatively comfortable to the parties concerned; the neglect of this training can make this life a constant peril and distress to the parties concerned.", "377": "Y.M. You have said that training is everything; that training is the man himself, for it makes him what he is.", "378": "O.M. I said training and another thing. Let that other thing pass, for the moment. What were you going to say?", "379": "Y.M. We have an old servant. She has been with us twenty\u2014two years. Her service used to be faultless, but now she has become very forgetful. We are all fond of her; we all recognize that she cannot help the infirmity which age has brought her; the rest of the family do not scold her for her remissnesses, but at times I do\u2014I can't seem to control myself. Don't I try? I do try. Now, then, when I was ready to dress, this morning, no clean clothes had been put out. I lost my temper; I lose it easiest and quickest in the early morning. I rang; and immediately began to warn myself not to show temper, and to be careful and speak gently. I safe-guarded myself most carefully. I even chose the very word I would use: \u201cYou've forgotten the clean clothes, Jane.\u201d When she appeared in the door I opened my mouth to say that phrase\u2014and out of it, moved by an instant surge of passion which I was not expecting and hadn't time to put under control, came the hot rebuke, \u201cYou've forgotten them again!\u201d You say a man always does the thing which will best please his Interior Master. Whence came the impulse to make careful preparation to save the girl the humiliation of a rebuke? Did that come from the Master, who is always primarily concerned about himself?", "380": "O.M. Unquestionably. There is no other source for any impulse. Secondarily you made preparation to save the girl, but primarily its object was to save yourself, by contenting the Master.", "381": "Y.M. How do you mean?", "382": "O.M. Has any member of the family ever implored you to watch your temper and not fly out at the girl?", "383": "Y.M. Yes. My mother.", "384": "O.M. You love her?", "385": "Y.M. Oh, more than that!", "386": "O.M. You would always do anything in your power to please her?", "387": "Y.M. It is a delight to me to do anything to please her!", "388": "O.M. Why? You would do it for pay, solely \u2014for profit. What profit would you expect and certainly receive from the investment?", "389": "Y.M. Personally? None. To please her is enough.", "390": "O.M. It appears, then, that your object, primarily, wasn't to save the girl a humiliation, but to please your mother. It also appears that to please your mother gives you a strong pleasure. Is not that the profit which you get out of the investment? Isn't that the real profits and first profit?", "391": "Y.M. Oh, well? Go on.", "392": "O.M. In all transactions, the Interior Master looks to it that you get the first profit. Otherwise there is no transaction.", "393": "Y.M. Well, then, if I was so anxious to get that profit and so intent upon it, why did I throw it away by losing my temper?", "394": "O.M. In order to get another profit which suddenly superseded it in value.", "395": "Y.M. Where was it?", "396": "O.M. Ambushed behind your born temperament, and waiting for a chance. Your native warm temper suddenly jumped to the front, and for the moment its influence was more powerful than your mother's, and abolished it. In that instance you were eager to flash out a hot rebuke and enjoy it. You did enjoy it, didn't you?", "397": "Y.M. For\u2014for a quarter of a second. Yes\u2014I did.", "398": "O.M. Very well, it is as I have said: the thing which will give you the most pleasure, the most satisfaction, in any moment or fraction of a moment, is the thing you will always do. You must content the Master's latest whim, whatever it may be.", "399": "Y.M. But when the tears came into the old servant's eyes I could have cut my hand off for what I had done.", "400": "O.M. Right. You had humiliated yourself, you see, you had given yourself pain. Nothing is of first importance to a man except results which damage him or profit him\u2014all the rest is secondary. Your Master was displeased with you, although you had obeyed him. He required a prompt repentance; you obeyed again; you had to\u2014there is never any escape from his commands. He is a hard master and fickle; he changes his mind in the fraction of a second, but you must be ready to obey, and you will obey, always. If he requires repentance, you content him, you will always furnish it. He must be nursed, petted, coddled, and kept contented, let the terms be what they may.", "401": "Y.M. Training! Oh, what's the use of it? Didn't I, and didn't my mother try to train me up to where I would no longer fly out at that girl?", "402": "O.M. Have you never managed to keep back a scolding?", "403": "Y.M. Oh, certainly\u2014many times.", "404": "O.M. More times this year than last?", "405": "Y.M. Yes, a good many more.", "406": "O.M. More times last year than the year before?", "407": "Y.M. Yes.", "408": "O.M. There is a large improvement, then, in the two years?", "409": "Y.M. Yes, undoubtedly.", "410": "O.M. Then your question is answered. You see there is use in training. Keep on. Keeping faithfully on. You are doing well.", "411": "Y.M. Will my reform reach perfection?", "412": "O.M. It will. Up to your limit.", "413": "Y.M. My limit? What do you mean by that?", "414": "O.M. You remember that you said that I said training was everything. I corrected you, and said \u201ctraining and another thing.\u201d That other thing is temperament \u2014that is, the disposition you were born with. You can't eradicate your disposition nor any rag of it \u2014you can only put a pressure on it and keep it down and quiet. You have a warm temper?", "415": "Y.M. Yes.", "416": "O.M. You will never get rid of it; but by watching it you can keep it down nearly all the time. Its presence is your limit. Your reform will never quite reach perfection, for your temper will beat you now and then, but you come near enough. You have made valuable progress and can make more. There is use in training. Immense use. Presently you will reach a new stage of development, then your progress will be easier; will proceed on a simpler basis, anyway.", "417": "Y.M. Explain.", "418": "O.M. You keep back your scoldings now, to please yourself by pleasing your mother; presently the mere triumphing over your temper will delight your vanity and confer a more delicious pleasure and satisfaction upon you than even the approbation of your mother confers upon you now. You will then labor for yourself directly and at first hand, not by the roundabout way through your mother. It simplifies the matter, and it also strengthens the impulse.", "419": "Y.M. Ah, dear! But I sha'n't ever reach the point where I will spare the girl for her sake primarily, not mine?", "420": "O.M. Why\u2014yes. In heaven.", "421": "Y.M. (After a reflective pause) Temperament. Well, I see one must allow for temperament. It is a large factor, sure enough. My mother is thoughtful, and not hot-tempered. When I was dressed I went to her room; she was not there; I called, she answered from the bathroom. I heard the water running. I inquired. She answered, without temper, that Jane had forgotten her bath, and she was preparing it herself. I offered to ring, but she said, \u201cNo, don't do that; it would only distress her to be confronted with her lapse, and would be a rebuke; she doesn't deserve that\u2014she is not to blame for the tricks her memory serves her.\u201d I say\u2014has my mother an Interior Master?\u2014and where was he?", "422": "O.M. He was there. There, and looking out for his own peace and pleasure and contentment. The girl's distress would have pained your mother. Otherwise the girl would have been rung up, distress and all. I know women who would have gotten a No. 1 pleasure out of ringing Jane up\u2014and so they would infallibly have pushed the button and obeyed the law of their make and training, which are the servants of their Interior Masters. It is quite likely that a part of your mother's forbearance came from training. The good kind of training\u2014whose best and highest function is to see to it that every time it confers a satisfaction upon its pupil a benefit shall fall at second hand upon others.", "423": "Y.M. If you were going to condense into an admonition your plan for the general betterment of the race's condition, how would you word it?", "424": "Admonition", "425": "O.M. Diligently train your ideals upward and still upward toward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which, while contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor and the community.", "426": "Y.M. Is that a new gospel?", "427": "O.M. No.", "428": "Y.M. It has been taught before?", "429": "O.M. For ten thousand years.", "430": "Y.M. By whom?", "431": "O.M. All the great religions\u2014all the great gospels.", "432": "Y.M. Then there is nothing new about it?", "433": "O.M. Oh yes, there is. It is candidly stated, this time. That has not been done before.", "434": "Y.M. How do you mean?", "435": "O.M. Haven't I put you first, and your neighbor and the community afterward?", "436": "Y.M. Well, yes, that is a difference, it is true.", "437": "O.M. The difference between straight speaking and crooked; the difference between frankness and shuffling.", "438": "Y.M. Explain.", "439": "O.M. The others offer you a hundred bribes to be good, thus conceding that the Master inside of you must be conciliated and contented first, and that you will do nothing at first hand but for his sake; then they turn square around and require you to do good for other's sake chiefly; and to do your duty for duty's sake, chiefly; and to do acts of self-sacrifice. Thus at the outset we all stand upon the same ground\u2014recognition of the supreme and absolute Monarch that resides in man, and we all grovel before him and appeal to him; then those others dodge and shuffle, and face around and unfrankly and inconsistently and illogically change the form of their appeal and direct its persuasions to man's second-place powers and to powers which have no existence in him, thus advancing them to first place; whereas in my Admonition I stick logically and consistently to the original position: I place the Interior Master's requirements first, and keep them there.", "440": "Y.M. If we grant, for the sake of argument, that your scheme and the other schemes aim at and produce the same result\u2014right living\u2014has yours an advantage over the others?", "441": "O.M. One, yes\u2014a large one. It has no concealments, no deceptions. When a man leads a right and valuable life under it he is not deceived as to the real chief motive which impels him to it\u2014in those other cases he is.", "442": "Y.M. Is that an advantage? Is it an advantage to live a lofty life for a mean reason? In the other cases he lives the lofty life under the impression that he is living for a lofty reason. Is not that an advantage?", "443": "O.M. Perhaps so. The same advantage he might get out of thinking himself a duke, and living a duke's life and parading in ducal fuss and feathers, when he wasn't a duke at all, and could find it out if he would only examine the herald's records.", "444": "Y.M. But anyway, he is obliged to do a duke's part; he puts his hand in his pocket and does his benevolences on as big a scale as he can stand, and that benefits the community.", "445": "O.M. He could do that without being a duke.", "446": "Y.M. But would he?", "447": "O.M. Don't you see where you are arriving?", "448": "Y.M. Where?", "449": "O.M. At the standpoint of the other schemes: That it is good morals to let an ignorant duke do showy benevolences for his pride's sake, a pretty low motive, and go on doing them unwarned, lest if he were made acquainted with the actual motive which prompted them he might shut up his purse and cease to be good?", "450": "Y.M. But isn't it best to leave him in ignorance, as long as he thinks he is doing good for others' sake?", "451": "O.M. Perhaps so. It is the position of the other schemes. They think humbug is good enough morals when the dividend on it is good deeds and handsome conduct.", "452": "Y.M. It is my opinion that under your scheme of a man's doing a good deed for his own sake first-off, instead of first for the good deed's sake, no man would ever do one.", "453": "O.M. Have you committed a benevolence lately?", "454": "Y.M. Yes. This morning.", "455": "O.M. Give the particulars.", "456": "Y.M. The cabin of the old negro woman who used to nurse me when I was a child and who saved my life once at the risk of her own, was burned last night, and she came mourning this morning, and pleading for money to build another one.", "457": "O.M. You furnished it?", "458": "Y.M. Certainly.", "459": "O.M. You were glad you had the money?", "460": "Y.M. Money? I hadn't. I sold my horse.", "461": "O.M. You were glad you had the horse?", "462": "Y.M. Of course I was; for if I hadn't had the horse I should have been incapable, and my mother would have captured the chance to set old Sally up.", "463": "O.M. You were cordially glad you were not caught out and incapable?", "464": "Y.M. Oh, I just was!", "465": "O.M. Now, then\u2014", "466": "Y.M. Stop where you are! I know your whole catalog of questions, and I could answer every one of them without your wasting the time to ask them; but I will summarize the whole thing in a single remark: I did the charity knowing it was because the act would give me a splendid pleasure, and because old Sally's moving gratitude and delight would give me another one; and because the reflection that she would be happy now and out of her trouble would fill me full of happiness. I did the whole thing with my eyes open and recognizing and realizing that I was looking out for my share of the profits first. Now then, I have confessed. Go on.", "467": "O.M. I haven't anything to offer; you have covered the whole ground. Can you have been any more strongly moved to help Sally out of her trouble\u2014could you have done the deed any more eagerly\u2014if you had been under the delusion that you were doing it for her sake and profit only?", "468": "Y.M. No! Nothing in the world could have made the impulse which moved me more powerful, more masterful, more thoroughly irresistible. I played the limit!", "469": "O.M. Very well. You begin to suspect\u2014and I claim to know \u2014that when a man is a shade more strongly moved to do one of two things or of two dozen things than he is to do any one of the others, he will infallibly do that one thing, be it good or be it evil; and if it be good, not all the beguilements of all the casuistries can increase the strength of the impulse by a single shade or add a shade to the comfort and contentment he will get out of the act.", "470": "Y.M. Then you believe that such tendency toward doing good as is in men's hearts would not be diminished by the removal of the delusion that good deeds are done primarily for the sake of No. 2 instead of for the sake of No. 1?", "471": "O.M. That is what I fully believe.", "472": "Y.M. Doesn't it somehow seem to take from the dignity of the deed?", "473": "O.M. If there is dignity in falsity, it does. It removes that.", "474": "Y.M. What is left for the moralists to do?", "475": "O.M. Teach unreservedly what he already teaches with one side of his mouth and takes back with the other: Do right for your own sake, and be happy in knowing that your neighbor will certainly share in the benefits resulting.", "476": "Y.M. Repeat your Admonition.", "477": "O.M. Diligently train your ideals upward and still upward toward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which, while contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor and the community.", "478": "Y.M. One's every act proceeds from exterior influences, you think?", "479": "O.M. Yes.", "480": "Y.M. If I conclude to rob a person, I am not the originator of the idea, but it comes in from the outside? I see him handling money\u2014for instance\u2014and that moves me to the crime?", "481": "O.M. That, by itself? Oh, certainly not. It is merely the latest outside influence of a procession of preparatory influences stretching back over a period of years. No single outside influence can make a man do a thing which is at war with his training. The most it can do is to start his mind on a new tract and open it to the reception of new influences\u2014as in the case of Ignatius Loyola. In time these influences can train him to a point where it will be consonant with his new character to yield to the final influence and do that thing. I will put the case in a form which will make my theory clear to you, I think. Here are two ingots of virgin gold. They shall represent a couple of characters which have been refined and perfected in the virtues by years of diligent right training. Suppose you wanted to break down these strong and well-compacted characters\u2014what influence would you bring to bear upon the ingots?", "482": "Y.M. Work it out yourself. Proceed.", "483": "O.M. Suppose I turn upon one of them a steam-jet during a long succession of hours. Will there be a result?", "484": "Y.M. None that I know of.", "485": "O.M. Why?", "486": "Y.M. A steam-jet cannot break down such a substance.", "487": "O.M. Very well. The steam is an outside influence, but it is ineffective because the gold takes no interest in it. The ingot remains as it was. Suppose we add to the steam some quicksilver in a vaporized condition, and turn the jet upon the ingot, will there be an instantaneous result?", "488": "Y.M. No.", "489": "O.M. The quicksilver is an outside influence which gold (by its peculiar nature\u2014say temperament, disposition) cannot be indifferent to. It stirs up the interest of the gold, although we do not perceive it; but a single application of the influence works no damage. Let us continue the application in a steady stream, and call each minute a year. By the end of ten or twenty minutes\u2014ten or twenty years\u2014the little ingot is sodden with quicksilver, its virtues are gone, its character is degraded. At last it is ready to yield to a temptation which it would have taken no notice of, ten or twenty years ago. We will apply that temptation in the form of a pressure of my finger. You note the result?", "490": "Y.M. Yes; the ingot has crumbled to sand. I understand, now. It is not the single outside influence that does the work, but only the last one of a long and disintegrating accumulation of them. I see, now, how my single impulse to rob the man is not the one that makes me do it, but only the last one of a preparatory series. You might illustrate with a parable.", "491": "A Parable", "492": "O.M. I will. There was once a pair of New England boys\u2014twins. They were alike in good dispositions, feckless morals, and personal appearance. They were the models of the Sunday\u2014school. At fifteen George had the opportunity to go as cabin-boy in a whale-ship, and sailed away for the Pacific. Henry remained at home in the village. At eighteen George was a sailor before the mast, and Henry was teacher of the advanced Bible class. At twenty-two George, through fighting-habits and drinking-habits acquired at sea and in the sailor boarding-houses of the European and Oriental ports, was a common rough in Hong-Kong, and out of a job; and Henry was superintendent of the Sunday-school. At twenty-six George was a wanderer, a tramp, and Henry was pastor of the village church. Then George came home, and was Henry's guest. One evening a man passed by and turned down the lane, and Henry said, with a pathetic smile, \u201cWithout intending me a discomfort, that man is always keeping me reminded of my pinching poverty, for he carries heaps of money about him, and goes by here every evening of his life.\u201d That outside influence \u2014that remark\u2014was enough for George, but it was not the one that made him ambush the man and rob him, it merely represented the eleven years' accumulation of such influences, and gave birth to the act for which their long gestation had made preparation. It had never entered the head of Henry to rob the man\u2014his ingot had been subjected to clean steam only; but George's had been subjected to vaporized quicksilver.", "493": "More About the Machine", "494": "Note.\u2014When Mrs. W. asks how can a millionaire give a single dollar to colleges and museums while one human being is destitute of bread, she has answered her question herself. Her feeling for the poor shows that she has a standard of benevolence; there she has conceded the millionaire's privilege of having a standard; since she evidently requires him to adopt her standard, she is by that act requiring herself to adopt his. The human being always looks down when he is examining another person's standard; he never find one that he has to examine by looking up.", "495": "The Man-Machine Again", "496": "Young Man. You really think man is a mere machine?", "497": "Old Man. I do.", "498": "Y.M. And that his mind works automatically and is independent of his control\u2014carries on thought on its own hook?", "499": "O.M. Yes. It is diligently at work, unceasingly at work, during every waking moment. Have you never tossed about all night, imploring, beseeching, commanding your mind to stop work and let you go to sleep?\u2014you who perhaps imagine that your mind is your servant and must obey your orders, think what you tell it to think, and stop when you tell it to stop. When it chooses to work, there is no way to keep it still for an instant. The brightest man would not be able to supply it with subjects if he had to hunt them up. If it needed the man's help it would wait for him to give it work when he wakes in the morning.", "500": "Y.M. Maybe it does.", "501": "O.M. No, it begins right away, before the man gets wide enough awake to give it a suggestion. He may go to sleep saying, \u201cThe moment I wake I will think upon such and such a subject,\u201d but he will fail. His mind will be too quick for him; by the time he has become nearly enough awake to be half conscious, he will find that it is already at work upon another subject. Make the experiment and see.", "502": "Y.M. At any rate, he can make it stick to a subject if he wants to.", "503": "O.M. Not if it find another that suits it better. As a rule it will listen to neither a dull speaker nor a bright one. It refuses all persuasion. The dull speaker wearies it and sends it far away in idle dreams; the bright speaker throws out stimulating ideas which it goes chasing after and is at once unconscious of him and his talk. You cannot keep your mind from wandering, if it wants to; it is master, not you.", "504": "O.M. Now, dreams\u2014but we will examine that later. Meantime, did you try commanding your mind to wait for orders from you, and not do any thinking on its own hook?", "505": "Y.M. Yes, I commanded it to stand ready to take orders when I should wake in the morning.", "506": "O.M. Did it obey?", "507": "Y.M. No. It went to thinking of something of its own initiation, without waiting for me. Also\u2014as you suggested\u2014at night I appointed a theme for it to begin on in the morning, and commanded it to begin on that one and no other.", "508": "O.M. Did it obey?", "509": "Y.M. No.", "510": "O.M. How many times did you try the experiment?", "511": "Y.M. Ten.", "512": "O.M. How many successes did you score?", "513": "Y.M. Not one.", "514": "O.M. It is as I have said: the mind is independent of the man. He has no control over it; it does as it pleases. It will take up a subject in spite of him; it will stick to it in spite of him; it will throw it aside in spite of him. It is entirely independent of him.", "515": "Y.M. Go on. Illustrate.", "516": "O.M. Do you know chess?", "517": "Y.M. I learned it a week ago.", "518": "O.M. Did your mind go on playing the game all night that first night?", "519": "Y.M. Don't mention it!", "520": "O.M. It was eagerly, unsatisfiably interested; it rioted in the combinations; you implored it to drop the game and let you get some sleep?", "521": "Y.M. Yes. It wouldn't listen; it played right along. It wore me out and I got up haggard and wretched in the morning.", "522": "O.M. At some time or other you have been captivated by a ridiculous rhyme-jingle?", "523": "Y.M. Indeed, yes!", "524": "And so on. My mind went mad with joy over it. It repeated it all day and all night for a week in spite of all I could do to stop it, and it seemed to me that I must surely go crazy.", "525": "O.M. And the new popular song?", "526": "Y.M. Oh yes! \u201cIn the Swee-eet By and By\u201d; etc. Yes, the new popular song with the taking melody sings through one's head day and night, asleep and awake, till one is a wreck. There is no getting the mind to let it alone.", "527": "O.M. Yes, asleep as well as awake. The mind is quite independent. It is master. You have nothing to do with it. It is so apart from you that it can conduct its affairs, sing its songs, play its chess, weave its complex and ingeniously constructed dreams, while you sleep. It has no use for your help, no use for your guidance, and never uses either, whether you be asleep or awake. You have imagined that you could originate a thought in your mind, and you have sincerely believed you could do it.", "528": "Y.M. Yes, I have had that idea.", "529": "O.M. Yet you can't originate a dream-thought for it to work out, and get it accepted?", "530": "Y.M. No.", "531": "O.M. And you can't dictate its procedure after it has originated a dream-thought for itself?", "532": "Y.M. No. No one can do it. Do you think the waking mind and the dream mind are the same machine?", "533": "O.M. There is argument for it. We have wild and fantastic day-thoughts? Things that are dream-like?", "534": "Y.M. Yes\u2014like Mr. Wells's man who invented a drug that made him invisible; and like the Arabian tales of the Thousand Nights.", "535": "O.M. And there are dreams that are rational, simple, consistent, and unfantastic?", "536": "Y.M. Yes. I have dreams that are like that. Dreams that are just like real life; dreams in which there are several persons with distinctly differentiated characters\u2014inventions of my mind and yet strangers to me: a vulgar person; a refined one; a wise person; a fool; a cruel person; a kind and compassionate one; a quarrelsome person; a peacemaker; old persons and young; beautiful girls and homely ones. They talk in character, each preserves his own characteristics. There are vivid fights, vivid and biting insults, vivid love-passages; there are tragedies and comedies, there are griefs that go to one's heart, there are sayings and doings that make you laugh: indeed, the whole thing is exactly like real life.", "537": "O.M. Your dreaming mind originates the scheme, consistently and artistically develops it, and carries the little drama creditably through\u2014all without help or suggestion from you?", "538": "Y.M. Yes.", "539": "O.M. It is argument that it could do the like awake without help or suggestion from you\u2014and I think it does. It is argument that it is the same old mind in both cases, and never needs your help. I think the mind is purely a machine, a thoroughly independent machine, an automatic machine. Have you tried the other experiment which I suggested to you?", "540": "Y.M. Which one?", "541": "O.M. The one which was to determine how much influence you have over your mind\u2014if any.", "542": "Y.M. Yes, and got more or less entertainment out of it. I did as you ordered: I placed two texts before my eyes\u2014one a dull one and barren of interest, the other one full of interest, inflamed with it, white-hot with it. I commanded my mind to busy itself solely with the dull one.", "543": "O.M. Did it obey?", "544": "Y.M. Well, no, it didn't. It busied itself with the other one.", "545": "O.M. Did you try hard to make it obey?", "546": "Y.M. Yes, I did my honest best.", "547": "O.M. What was the text which it refused to be interested in or think about?", "548": "Y.M. It was this question: If A owes B a dollar and a half, and B owes C two and three-quarter, and C owes A thirty\u2014five cents, and D and A together owe E and B three-sixteenths of\u2014of\u2014I don't remember the rest, now, but anyway it was wholly uninteresting, and I could not force my mind to stick to it even half a minute at a time; it kept flying off to the other text.", "549": "O.M. What was the other text?", "550": "Y.M. It is no matter about that.", "551": "O.M. But what was it?", "552": "Y.M. A photograph.", "553": "O.M. Your own?", "554": "Y.M. No. It was hers.", "555": "O.M. You really made an honest good test. Did you make a second trial?", "556": "Y.M. Yes. I commanded my mind to interest itself in the morning paper's report of the pork-market, and at the same time I reminded it of an experience of mine of sixteen years ago. It refused to consider the pork and gave its whole blazing interest to that ancient incident.", "557": "O.M. What was the incident?", "558": "Y.M. An armed desperado slapped my face in the presence of twenty spectators. It makes me wild and murderous every time I think of it.", "559": "O.M. Good tests, both; very good tests. Did you try my other suggestion?", "560": "Y.M. The one which was to prove to me that if I would leave my mind to its own devices it would find things to think about without any of my help, and thus convince me that it was a machine, an automatic machine, set in motion by exterior influences, and as independent of me as it could be if it were in some one else's skull. Is that the one?", "561": "O.M. Yes.", "562": "Y.M. I tried it. I was shaving. I had slept well, and my mind was very lively, even gay and frisky. It was reveling in a fantastic and joyful episode of my remote boyhood which had suddenly flashed up in my memory\u2014moved to this by the spectacle of a yellow cat picking its way carefully along the top of the garden wall. The color of this cat brought the bygone cat before me, and I saw her walking along the side-step of the pulpit; saw her walk on to a large sheet of sticky fly-paper and get all her feet involved; saw her struggle and fall down, helpless and dissatisfied, more and more urgent, more and more unreconciled, more and more mutely profane; saw the silent congregation quivering like jelly, and the tears running down their faces. I saw it all. The sight of the tears whisked my mind to a far distant and a sadder scene\u2014in Terra del Fuego\u2014and with Darwin's eyes I saw a naked great savage hurl his little boy against the rocks for a trifling fault; saw the poor mother gather up her dying child and hug it to her breast and weep, uttering no word. Did my mind stop to mourn with that nude black sister of mine? No\u2014it was far away from that scene in an instant, and was busying itself with an ever-recurring and disagreeable dream of mine. In this dream I always find myself, stripped to my shirt, cringing and dodging about in the midst of a great drawing-room throng of finely dressed ladies and gentlemen, and wondering how I got there. And so on and so on, picture after picture, incident after incident, a drifting panorama of ever-changing, ever-dissolving views manufactured by my mind without any help from me\u2014why, it would take me two hours to merely name the multitude of things my mind tallied off and photographed in fifteen minutes, let alone describe them to you.", "563": "O.M. A man's mind, left free, has no use for his help. But there is one way whereby he can get its help when he desires it.", "564": "Y.M. What is that way?", "565": "O.M. When your mind is racing along from subject to subject and strikes an inspiring one, open your mouth and begin talking upon that matter\u2014or\u2014take your pen and use that. It will interest your mind and concentrate it, and it will pursue the subject with satisfaction. It will take full charge, and furnish the words itself.", "566": "Y.M. But don't I tell it what to say?", "567": "O.M. There are certainly occasions when you haven't time. The words leap out before you know what is coming.", "568": "Y.M. For instance?", "569": "O.M. Well, take a \u201cflash of wit\u201d\u2014repartee. Flash is the right word. It is out instantly. There is no time to arrange the words. There is no thinking, no reflecting. Where there is a wit-mechanism it is automatic in its action and needs no help. Where the wit-mechanism is lacking, no amount of study and reflection can manufacture the product.", "570": "Y.M. You really think a man originates nothing, creates nothing.", "571": "The Thinking-Process", "572": "O.M. I do. Men perceive, and their brain-machines automatically combine the things perceived. That is all.", "573": "Y.M. The steam-engine?", "574": "O.M. It takes fifty men a hundred years to invent it. One meaning of invent is discover. I use the word in that sense. Little by little they discover and apply the multitude of details that go to make the perfect engine. Watt noticed that confined steam was strong enough to lift the lid of the teapot. He didn't create the idea, he merely discovered the fact; the cat had noticed it a hundred times. From the teapot he evolved the cylinder\u2014from the displaced lid he evolved the piston-rod. To attach something to the piston-rod to be moved by it, was a simple matter\u2014crank and wheel. And so there was a working engine.", "575": "One by one, improvements were discovered by men who used their eyes, not their creating powers\u2014for they hadn't any\u2014and now, after a hundred years the patient contributions of fifty or a hundred observers stand compacted in the wonderful machine which drives the ocean liner.", "576": "Y.M. A Shakespearean play?", "577": "O.M. The process is the same. The first actor was a savage. He reproduced in his theatrical war-dances, scalp\u2014dances, and so on, incidents which he had seen in real life. A more advanced civilization produced more incidents, more episodes; the actor and the story-teller borrowed them. And so the drama grew, little by little, stage by stage. It is made up of the facts of life, not creations. It took centuries to develop the Greek drama. It borrowed from preceding ages; it lent to the ages that came after. Men observe and combine, that is all. So does a rat.", "578": "Y.M. How?", "579": "O.M. He observes a smell, he infers a cheese, he seeks and finds. The astronomer observes this and that; adds his this and that to the this-and-thats of a hundred predecessors, infers an invisible planet, seeks it and finds it. The rat gets into a trap; gets out with trouble; infers that cheese in traps lacks value, and meddles with that trap no more. The astronomer is very proud of his achievement, the rat is proud of his. Yet both are machines; they have done machine work, they have originated nothing, they have no right to be vain; the whole credit belongs to their Maker. They are entitled to no honors, no praises, no monuments when they die, no remembrance. One is a complex and elaborate machine, the other a simple and limited machine, but they are alike in principle, function, and process, and neither of them works otherwise than automatically, and neither of them may righteously claim a personal superiority or a personal dignity above the other.", "580": "Y.M. In earned personal dignity, then, and in personal merit for what he does, it follows of necessity that he is on the same level as a rat?", "581": "O.M. His brother the rat; yes, that is how it seems to me. Neither of them being entitled to any personal merit for what he does, it follows of necessity that neither of them has a right to arrogate to himself (personally created) superiorities over his brother.", "582": "Y.M. Are you determined to go on believing in these insanities? Would you go on believing in them in the face of able arguments backed by collated facts and instances?", "583": "O.M. I have been a humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker.", "584": "Y.M. Very well?", "585": "O.M. The humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker is always convertible by such means.", "586": "Y.M. I am thankful to God to hear you say this, for now I know that your conversion\u2014", "587": "O.M. Wait. You misunderstand. I said I have been a Truth-Seeker.", "588": "Y.M. Well?", "589": "O.M. I am not that now. Have your forgotten? I told you that there are none but temporary Truth-Seekers; that a permanent one is a human impossibility; that as soon as the Seeker finds what he is thoroughly convinced is the Truth, he seeks no further, but gives the rest of his days to hunting junk to patch it and caulk it and prop it with, and make it weather-proof and keep it from caving in on him. Hence the Presbyterian remains a Presbyterian, the Mohammedan a Mohammedan, the Spiritualist a Spiritualist, the Democrat a Democrat, the Republican a Republican, the Monarchist a Monarchist; and if a humble, earnest, and sincere Seeker after Truth should find it in the proposition that the moon is made of green cheese nothing could ever budge him from that position; for he is nothing but an automatic machine, and must obey the laws of his construction.", "590": "Y.M. And so\u2014", "591": "O.M. Having found the Truth; perceiving that beyond question man has but one moving impulse\u2014the contenting of his own spirit\u2014and is merely a machine and entitled to no personal merit for anything he does, it is not humanly possible for me to seek further. The rest of my days will be spent in patching and painting and puttying and caulking my priceless possession and in looking the other way when an imploring argument or a damaging fact approaches.", "592": "1. The Marquess of Worcester had done all of this more than a century earlier.", "593": "Young Man. It is odious.

I don't\u2014morally. That would not be fair to the rat. The rat is well above him, there.", "597": "Y.M. Are you joking?", "598": "O.M. No, I am not.", "599": "Y.M. Then what do you mean?", "600": "O.M. That comes under the head of the Moral Sense. It is a large question. Let us finish with what we are about now, before we take it up.", "601": "Y.M. Very well. You have seemed to concede that you place Man and the rat on a level. What is it? The intellectual?", "602": "O.M. In form\u2014not a degree.", "603": "Y.M. Explain.", "604": "O.M. I think that the rat's mind and the man's mind are the same machine, but of unequal capacities\u2014like yours and Edison's; like the African pygmy's and Homer's; like the Bushman's and Bismarck's.", "605": "Y.M. How are you going to make that out, when the lower animals have no mental quality but instinct, while man possesses reason?", "606": "O.M. What is instinct?", "607": "Y.M. It is merely unthinking and mechanical exercise of inherited habit.", "608": "O.M. What originated the habit?", "609": "Y.M. The first animal started it, its descendants have inherited it.", "610": "O.M. How did the first one come to start it?", "611": "Y.M. I don't know; but it didn't think it out.", "612": "O.M. How do you know it didn't?", "613": "Y.M. Well\u2014I have a right to suppose it didn't, anyway.", "614": "O.M. I don't believe you have. What is thought?", "615": "Y.M. I know what you call it: the mechanical and automatic putting together of impressions received from outside, and drawing an inference from them.", "616": "O.M. Very good. Now my idea of the meaningless term \u201cinstinct\u201d is, that it is merely petrified thought; solidified and made inanimate by habit; thought which was once alive and awake, but is become unconscious\u2014walks in its sleep, so to speak.", "617": "Y.M. Illustrate it.", "618": "O.M. Take a herd of cows, feeding in a pasture. Their heads are all turned in one direction. They do that instinctively; they gain nothing by it, they have no reason for it, they don't know why they do it. It is an inherited habit which was originally thought\u2014that is to say, observation of an exterior fact, and a valuable inference drawn from that observation and confirmed by experience. The original wild ox noticed that with the wind in his favor he could smell his enemy in time to escape; then he inferred that it was worth while to keep his nose to the wind. That is the process which man calls reasoning. Man's thought-machine works just like the other animals', but it is a better one and more Edisonian. Man, in the ox's place, would go further, reason wider: he would face part of the herd the other way and protect both front and rear.", "619": "Y.M. Did you stay the term instinct is meaningless?", "620": "O.M. I think it is a bastard word. I think it confuses us; for as a rule it applies itself to habits and impulses which had a far-off origin in thought, and now and then breaks the rule and applies itself to habits which can hardly claim a thought-origin.", "621": "Y.M. Give an instance.", "622": "O.M. Well, in putting on trousers a man always inserts the same old leg first\u2014never the other one. There is no advantage in that, and no sense in it. All men do it, yet no man thought it out and adopted it of set purpose, I imagine. But it is a habit which is transmitted, no doubt, and will continue to be transmitted.", "623": "Y.M. Can you prove that the habit exists?", "624": "O.M. You can prove it, if you doubt. If you will take a man to a clothing-store and watch him try on a dozen pairs of trousers, you will see.", "625": "Y.M. The cow illustration is not\u2014", "626": "O.M. Sufficient to show that a dumb animal's mental machine is just the same as a man's and its reasoning processes the same? I will illustrate further. If you should hand Mr. Edison a box which you caused to fly open by some concealed device he would infer a spring, and would hunt for it and find it. Now an uncle of mine had an old horse who used to get into the closed lot where the corn-crib was and dishonestly take the corn. I got the punishment myself, as it was supposed that I had heedlessly failed to insert the wooden pin which kept the gate closed. These persistent punishments fatigued me; they also caused me to infer the existence of a culprit, somewhere; so I hid myself and watched the gate. Presently the horse came and pulled the pin out with his teeth and went in. Nobody taught him that; he had observed\u2014then thought it out for himself. His process did not differ from Edison's; he put this and that together and drew an inference\u2014and the peg, too; but I made him sweat for it.", "627": "Y.M. It has something of the seeming of thought about it. Still it is not very elaborate. Enlarge.", "628": "O.M. Suppose Mr. Edison has been enjoying some one's hospitalities. He comes again by and by, and the house is vacant. He infers that his host has moved. A while afterward, in another town, he sees the man enter a house; he infers that that is the new home, and follows to inquire. Here, now, is the experience of a gull, as related by a naturalist. The scene is a Scotch fishing village where the gulls were kindly treated. This particular gull visited a cottage; was fed; came next day and was fed again; came into the house, next time, and ate with the family; kept on doing this almost daily, thereafter. But, once the gull was away on a journey for a few days, and when it returned the house was vacant. Its friends had removed to a village three miles distant. Several months later it saw the head of the family on the street there, followed him home, entered the house without excuse or apology, and became a daily guest again. Gulls do not rank high mentally, but this one had memory and the reasoning faculty, you see, and applied them Edisonially.", "629": "Y.M. Yet it was not an Edison and couldn't be developed into one.", "630": "O.M. Perhaps not. Could you?", "631": "Y.M. That is neither here nor there. Go on.", "632": "O.M. If Edison were in trouble and a stranger helped him out of it and next day he got into the same difficulty again, he would infer the wise thing to do in case he knew the stranger's address. Here is a case of a bird and a stranger as related by a naturalist. An Englishman saw a bird flying around about his dog's head, down in the grounds, and uttering cries of distress. He went there to see about it. The dog had a young bird in his mouth\u2014unhurt. The gentleman rescued it and put it on a bush and brought the dog away. Early the next morning the mother bird came for the gentleman, who was sitting on his veranda, and by its maneuvers persuaded him to follow it to a distant part of the grounds\u2014flying a little way in front of him and waiting for him to catch up, and so on; and keeping to the winding path, too, instead of flying the near way across lots. The distance covered was four hundred yards. The same dog was the culprit; he had the young bird again, and once more he had to give it up. Now the mother bird had reasoned it all out: since the stranger had helped her once, she inferred that he would do it again; she knew where to find him, and she went upon her errand with confidence. Her mental processes were what Edison's would have been. She put this and that together\u2014and that is all that thought is \u2014and out of them built her logical arrangement of inferences. Edison couldn't have done it any better himself.", "633": "Y.M. Do you believe that many of the dumb animals can think?", "634": "O.M. Yes\u2014the elephant, the monkey, the horse, the dog, the parrot, the macaw, the mocking-bird, and many others. The elephant whose mate fell into a pit, and who dumped dirt and rubbish into the pit till bottom was raised high enough to enable the captive to step out, was equipped with the reasoning quality. I conceive that all animals that can learn things through teaching and drilling have to know how to observe, and put this and that together and draw an inference\u2014the process of thinking. Could you teach an idiot the manual of arms, and to advance, retreat, and go through complex field maneuvers at the word of command?", "635": "Y.M. Not if he were a thorough idiot.", "636": "O.M. Well, canary-birds can learn all that; dogs and elephants learn all sorts of wonderful things. They must surely be able to notice, and to put things together, and say to themselves, \u201cI get the idea, now: when I do so and so, as per order, I am praised and fed; when I do differently I am punished.\u201d Fleas can be taught nearly anything that a Congressman can.", "637": "Y.M. Granting, then, that dumb animals are able to think upon a low plane, is there any that can think upon a high one? Is there one that is well up toward man?", "638": "O.M. Yes. As a thinker and planner the ant is the equal of any savage race of men; as a self-educated specialist in several arts she is the superior of any savage race of men; and in one or two high mental qualities she is above the reach of any man, savage or civilized!", "639": "Y.M. Oh, come! you are abolishing the intellectual frontier which separates man and beast.", "640": "O.M. I beg your pardon. One cannot abolish what does not exist.", "641": "Y.M. You are not in earnest, I hope. You cannot mean to seriously say there is no such frontier.", "642": "O.M. I do say it seriously. The instances of the horse, the gull, the mother bird, and the elephant show that those creatures put their this's and thats together just as Edison would have done it and drew the same inferences that he would have drawn. Their mental machinery was just like his, also its manner of working. Their equipment was as inferior to the Strasburg clock, but that is the only difference\u2014there is no frontier.", "643": "Y.M. It looks exasperatingly true; and is distinctly offensive. It elevates the dumb beasts to\u2014to\u2014", "644": "O.M. Let us drop that lying phrase, and call them the Unrevealed Creatures; so far as we can know, there is no such thing as a dumb beast.", "645": "Y.M. On what grounds do you make that assertion?", "646": "O.M. On quite simple ones. \u201cDumb\u201d beast suggests an animal that has no thought-machinery, no understanding, no speech, no way of communicating what is in its mind. We know that a hen has speech. We cannot understand everything she says, but we easily learn two or three of her phrases. We know when she is saying, \u201cI have laid an egg\u201d; we know when she is saying to the chicks, \u201cRun here, dears, I've found a worm\u201d; we know what she is saying when she voices a warning: \u201cQuick! hurry! gather yourselves under mamma, there's a hawk coming!\u201d We understand the cat when she stretches herself out, purring with affection and contentment and lifts up a soft voice and says, \u201cCome, kitties, supper's ready\u201d; we understand her when she goes mourning about and says, \u201cWhere can they be? They are lost. Won't you help me hunt for them?\u201d and we understand the disreputable Tom when he challenges at midnight from his shed, \u201cYou come over here, you product of immoral commerce, and I'll make your fur fly!\u201d We understand a few of a dog's phrases and we learn to understand a few of the remarks and gestures of any bird or other animal that we domesticate and observe. The clearness and exactness of the few of the hen's speeches which we understand is argument that she can communicate to her kind a hundred things which we cannot comprehend\u2014in a word, that she can converse. And this argument is also applicable in the case of others of the great army of the Unrevealed. It is just like man's vanity and impertinence to call an animal dumb because it is dumb to his dull perceptions. Now as to the ant\u2014", "647": "Y.M. Yes, go back to the ant, the creature that\u2014as you seem to think\u2014sweeps away the last vestige of an intellectual frontier between man and the Unrevealed.", "648": "O.M. That is what she surely does. In all his history the aboriginal Australian never thought out a house for himself and built it. The ant is an amazing architect. She is a wee little creature, but she builds a strong and enduring house eight feet high\u2014a house which is as large in proportion to her size as is the largest capitol or cathedral in the world compared to man's size. No savage race has produced architects who could approach the ant in genius or culture. No civilized race has produced architects who could plan a house better for the uses proposed than can hers. Her house contains a throne-room; nurseries for her young; granaries; apartments for her soldiers, her workers, etc.; and they and the multifarious halls and corridors which communicate with them are arranged and distributed with an educated and experienced eye for convenience and adaptability.", "649": "Y.M. That could be mere instinct.", "650": "O.M. It would elevate the savage if he had it. But let us look further before we decide. The ant has soldiers\u2014battalions, regiments, armies; and they have their appointed captains and generals, who lead them to battle.", "651": "Y.M. That could be instinct, too.", "652": "O.M. We will look still further. The ant has a system of government; it is well planned, elaborate, and is well carried on.", "653": "Y.M. Instinct again.", "654": "O.M. She has crowds of slaves, and is a hard and unjust employer of forced labor.", "655": "Y.M. Instinct.", "656": "O.M. She has cows, and milks them.", "657": "Y.M. Instinct, of course.", "658": "O.M. In Texas she lays out a farm twelve feet square, plants it, weeds it, cultivates it, gathers the crop and stores it away.", "659": "Y.M. Instinct, all the same.", "660": "O.M. The ant discriminates between friend and stranger. Sir John Lubbock took ants from two different nests, made them drunk with whiskey and laid them, unconscious, by one of the nests, near some water. Ants from the nest came and examined and discussed these disgraced creatures, then carried their friends home and threw the strangers overboard. Sir John repeated the experiment a number of times. For a time the sober ants did as they had done at first\u2014carried their friends home and threw the strangers overboard. But finally they lost patience, seeing that their reformatory efforts went for nothing, and threw both friends and strangers overboard. Come\u2014is this instinct, or is it thoughtful and intelligent discussion of a thing new\u2014absolutely new\u2014to their experience; with a verdict arrived at, sentence passed, and judgment executed? Is it instinct?\u2014thought petrified by ages of habit\u2014or isn't it brand-new thought, inspired by the new occasion, the new circumstances?", "661": "Y.M. I have to concede it. It was not a result of habit; it has all the look of reflection, thought, putting this and that together, as you phrase it. I believe it was thought.", "662": "O.M. I will give you another instance of thought. Franklin had a cup of sugar on a table in his room. The ants got at it. He tried several preventives; and ants rose superior to them. Finally he contrived one which shut off access\u2014probably set the table's legs in pans of water, or drew a circle of tar around the cup, I don't remember. At any rate, he watched to see what they would do. They tried various schemes\u2014failures, every one. The ants were badly puzzled. Finally they held a consultation, discussed the problem, arrived at a decision\u2014and this time they beat that great philosopher. They formed in procession, cross the floor, climbed the wall, marched across the ceiling to a point just over the cup, then one by one they let go and fell down into it! Was that instinct\u2014thought petrified by ages of inherited habit?", "663": "Y.M. No, I don't believe it was. I believe it was a newly reasoned scheme to meet a new emergency.", "664": "O.M. Very well. You have conceded the reasoning power in two instances. I come now to a mental detail wherein the ant is a long way the superior of any human being. Sir John Lubbock proved by many experiments that an ant knows a stranger ant of her own species in a moment, even when the stranger is disguised\u2014with paint. Also he proved that an ant knows every individual in her hive of five hundred thousand souls. Also, after a year's absence one of the five hundred thousand she will straightway recognize the returned absentee and grace the recognition with an affectionate welcome. How are these recognitions made? Not by color, for painted ants were recognized. Not by smell, for ants that had been dipped in chloroform were recognized. Not by speech and not by antennae signs nor contacts, for the drunken and motionless ants were recognized and the friend discriminated from the stranger. The ants were all of the same species, therefore the friends had to be recognized by form and feature\u2014friends who formed part of a hive of five hundred thousand! Has any man a memory for form and feature approaching that?", "665": "Y.M. Certainly not.", "666": "O.M. Franklin's ants and Lubbuck's ants show fine capacities of putting this and that together in new and untried emergencies and deducting smart conclusions from the combinations\u2014a man's mental process exactly. With memory to help, man preserves his observations and reasonings, reflects upon them, adds to them, recombines, and so proceeds, stage by stage, to far results\u2014from the teakettle to the ocean greyhound's complex engine; from personal labor to slave labor; from wigwam to palace; from the capricious chase to agriculture and stored food; from nomadic life to stable government and concentrated authority; from incoherent hordes to massed armies. The ant has observation, the reasoning faculty, and the preserving adjunct of a prodigious memory; she has duplicated man's development and the essential features of his civilization, and you call it all instinct!", "667": "Y.M. Perhaps I lacked the reasoning faculty myself.", "668": "O.M. Well, don't tell anybody, and don't do it again.", "669": "Y.M. We have come a good way. As a result\u2014as I understand it\u2014I am required to concede that there is absolutely no intellectual frontier separating Man and the Unrevealed Creatures?", "670": "O.M. That is what you are required to concede. There is no such frontier\u2014there is no way to get around that. Man has a finer and more capable machine in him than those others, but it is the same machine and works in the same way. And neither he nor those others can command the machine\u2014it is strictly automatic, independent of control, works when it pleases, and when it doesn't please, it can't be forced.", "671": "Y.M. Then man and the other animals are all alike, as to mental machinery, and there isn't any difference of any stupendous magnitude between them, except in quality, not in kind.", "672": "O.M. That is about the state of it\u2014intellectuality. There are pronounced limitations on both sides. We can't learn to understand much of their language, but the dog, the elephant, etc., learn to understand a very great deal of ours. To that extent they are our superiors. On the other hand, they can't learn reading, writing, etc., nor any of our fine and high things, and there we have a large advantage over them.", "673": "Y.M. Very well, let them have what they've got, and welcome; there is still a wall, and a lofty one. They haven't got the Moral Sense; we have it, and it lifts us immeasurably above them.", "674": "O.M. What makes you think that?", "675": "Y.M. Now look here\u2014let's call a halt. I have stood the other infamies and insanities and that is enough; I am not going to have man and the other animals put on the same level morally.", "676": "O.M. I wasn't going to hoist man up to that.", "677": "Y.M. This is too much! I think it is not right to jest about such things.", "678": "O.M. I am not jesting, I am merely reflecting a plain and simple truth\u2014and without uncharitableness. The fact that man knows right from wrong proves his intellectual superiority to the other creatures; but the fact that he can do wrong proves his moral inferiority to any creature that cannot. It is my belief that this position is not assailable.", "679": "Free Will", "680": "Y.M. What is your opinion regarding Free Will?", "681": "O.M. That there is no such thing. Did the man possess it who gave the old woman his last shilling and trudged home in the storm?", "682": "Y.M. He had the choice between succoring the old woman and leaving her to suffer. Isn't it so?", "683": "O.M. Yes, there was a choice to be made, between bodily comfort on the one hand and the comfort of the spirit on the other. The body made a strong appeal, of course\u2014the body would be quite sure to do that; the spirit made a counter appeal. A choice had to be made between the two appeals, and was made. Who or what determined that choice?", "684": "Y.M. Any one but you would say that the man determined it, and that in doing it he exercised Free Will.", "685": "O.M. We are constantly assured that every man is endowed with Free Will, and that he can and must exercise it where he is offered a choice between good conduct and less-good conduct. Yet we clearly saw that in that man's case he really had no Free Will: his temperament, his training, and the daily influences which had molded him and made him what he was, compelled him to rescue the old woman and thus save himself \u2014save himself from spiritual pain, from unendurable wretchedness. He did not make the choice, it was made for him by forces which he could not control. Free Will has always existed in words, but it stops there, I think\u2014stops short of fact. I would not use those words\u2014Free Will\u2014but others.", "686": "Y.M. What others?", "687": "O.M. Free Choice.", "688": "Y.M. What is the difference?", "689": "O.M. The one implies untrammeled power to act as you please, the other implies nothing beyond a mere mental process: the critical ability to determine which of two things is nearest right and just.", "690": "Y.M. Make the difference clear, please.", "691": "O.M. The mind can freely select, choose, point out the right and just one\u2014its function stops there. It can go no further in the matter. It has no authority to say that the right one shall be acted upon and the wrong one discarded. That authority is in other hands.", "692": "Y.M. The man's?", "693": "O.M. In the machine which stands for him. In his born disposition and the character which has been built around it by training and environment.", "694": "Y.M. It will act upon the right one of the two?", "695": "O.M. It will do as it pleases in the matter. George Washington's machine would act upon the right one; Pizarro would act upon the wrong one.", "696": "Y.M. Then as I understand it a bad man's mental machinery calmly and judicially points out which of two things is right and just\u2014", "697": "O.M. Yes, and his moral machinery will freely act upon the one or the other, according to its make, and be quite indifferent to the mind's feeling concerning the matter\u2014that is, would be, if the mind had any feelings; which it hasn't. It is merely a thermometer: it registers the heat and the cold, and cares not a farthing about either.", "698": "Y.M. Then we must not claim that if a man knows which of two things is right he is absolutely bound to do that thing?", "699": "O.M. His temperament and training will decide what he shall do, and he will do it; he cannot help himself, he has no authority over the matter. Wasn't it right for David to go out and slay Goliath?", "700": "Y.M. Yes.", "701": "O.M. Then it would have been equally right for any one else to do it?", "702": "Y.M. Certainly.", "703": "O.M. Then it would have been right for a born coward to attempt it?", "704": "Y.M. It would\u2014yes.", "705": "O.M. You know that no born coward ever would have attempted it, don't you?", "706": "Y.M. Yes.", "707": "O.M. You know that a born coward's make and temperament would be an absolute and insurmountable bar to his ever essaying such a thing, don't you?", "708": "Y.M. Yes, I know it.", "709": "O.M. He clearly perceives that it would be right to try it?", "710": "Y.M. Yes.", "711": "O.M. His mind has Free Choice in determining that it would be right to try it?", "712": "Y.M. Yes.", "713": "O.M. Then if by reason of his inborn cowardice he simply can not essay it, what becomes of his Free Will? Where is his Free Will? Why claim that he has Free Will when the plain facts show that he hasn't? Why contend that because he and David see the right alike, both must act alike? Why impose the same laws upon goat and lion?", "714": "Y.M. There is really no such thing as Free Will?", "715": "O.M. It is what I think. There is will. But it has nothing to do with intellectual perceptions of right and wrong, and is not under their command. David's temperament and training had Will, and it was a compulsory force; David had to obey its decrees, he had no choice. The coward's temperament and training possess Will, and it is compulsory; it commands him to avoid danger, and he obeys, he has no choice. But neither the Davids nor the cowards possess Free Will\u2014will that may do the right or do the wrong, as their mental verdict shall decide.", "716": "Not Two Values, But Only One", "717": "Y.M. There is one thing which bothers me: I can't tell where you draw the line between material covetousness and spiritual covetousness.", "718": "O.M. I don't draw any.", "719": "Y.M. How do you mean?", "720": "O.M. There is no such thing as material covetousness. All covetousness is spiritual.", "721": "Y.M. All longings, desires, ambitions spiritual, never material?", "722": "O.M. Yes. The Master in you requires that in all cases you shall content his spirit \u2014that alone. He never requires anything else, he never interests himself in any other matter.", "723": "Y.M. Ah, come! When he covets somebody's money\u2014isn't that rather distinctly material and gross?", "724": "O.M. No. The money is merely a symbol\u2014it represents in visible and concrete form a spiritual desire. Any so-called material thing that you want is merely a symbol: you want it not for itself, but because it will content your spirit for the moment.", "725": "Y.M. Please particularize.", "726": "O.M. Very well. Maybe the thing longed for is a new hat. You get it and your vanity is pleased, your spirit contented. Suppose your friends deride the hat, make fun of it: at once it loses its value; you are ashamed of it, you put it out of your sight, you never want to see it again.", "727": "Y.M. I think I see. Go on.", "728": "O.M. It is the same hat, isn't it? It is in no way altered. But it wasn't the hat you wanted, but only what it stood for\u2014a something to please and content your spirit. When it failed of that, the whole of its value was gone. There are no material values; there are only spiritual ones. You will hunt in vain for a material value that is actual, real\u2014there is no such thing. The only value it possesses, for even a moment, is the spiritual value back of it: remove that end and it is at once worthless\u2014like the hat.", "729": "Y.M. Can you extend that to money?", "730": "O.M. Yes. It is merely a symbol, it has no material value; you think you desire it for its own sake, but it is not so. You desire it for the spiritual content it will bring; if it fail of that, you discover that its value is gone. There is that pathetic tale of the man who labored like a slave, unresting, unsatisfied, until he had accumulated a fortune, and was happy over it, jubilant about it; then in a single week a pestilence swept away all whom he held dear and left him desolate. His money's value was gone. He realized that his joy in it came not from the money itself, but from the spiritual contentment he got out of his family's enjoyment of the pleasures and delights it lavished upon them. Money has no material value; if you remove its spiritual value nothing is left but dross. It is so with all things, little or big, majestic or trivial\u2014there are no exceptions. Crowns, scepters, pennies, paste jewels, village notoriety, world-wide fame\u2014they are all the same, they have no material value: while they content the spirit they are precious, when this fails they are worthless.", "731": "A Difficult Question", "732": "Y.M. You keep me confused and perplexed all the time by your elusive terminology. Sometimes you divide a man up into two or three separate personalities, each with authorities, jurisdictions, and responsibilities of its own, and when he is in that condition I can't grasp it. Now when I speak of a man, he is the whole thing in one, and easy to hold and contemplate.", "733": "O.M. That is pleasant and convenient, if true. When you speak of \u201cmy body\u201d who is the \u201cmy\u201d?", "734": "Y.M. It is the \u201cme.\u201d", "735": "O.M. The body is a property then, and the Me owns it. Who is the Me?", "736": "Y.M. The Me is the whole thing; it is a common property; an undivided ownership, vested in the whole entity.", "737": "O.M. If the Me admires a rainbow, is it the whole Me that admires it, including the hair, hands, heels, and all?", "738": "Y.M. Certainly not. It is my mind that admires it.", "739": "O.M. So you divide the Me yourself. Everybody does; everybody must. What, then, definitely, is the Me?", "740": "Y.M. I think it must consist of just those two parts\u2014the body and the mind.", "741": "O.M. You think so? If you say \u201cI believe the world is round,\u201d who is the \u201cI\u201d that is speaking?", "742": "Y.M. The mind.", "743": "O.M. If you say \u201cI grieve for the loss of my father,\u201d who is the \u201cI\u201d?", "744": "Y.M. The mind.", "745": "O.M. Is the mind exercising an intellectual function when it examines and accepts the evidence that the world is round?", "746": "Y.M. Yes.", "747": "O.M. Is it exercising an intellectual function when it grieves for the loss of your father?", "748": "Y.M. That is not cerebration, brain-work, it is a matter of feeling.", "749": "O.M. Then its source is not in your mind, but in your moral territory?", "750": "Y.M. I have to grant it.", "751": "O.M. Is your mind a part of your physical equipment?", "752": "Y.M. No. It is independent of it; it is spiritual.", "753": "O.M. Being spiritual, it cannot be affected by physical influences?", "754": "Y.M. No.", "755": "O.M. Does the mind remain sober with the body is drunk?", "756": "Y.M. Well\u2014no.", "757": "O.M. There is a physical effect present, then?", "758": "Y.M. It looks like it.", "759": "O.M. A cracked skull has resulted in a crazy mind. Why should it happen if the mind is spiritual, and independent of physical influences?", "760": "Y.M. Well\u2014I don't know.", "761": "O.M. When you have a pain in your foot, how do you know it?", "762": "Y.M. I feel it.", "763": "O.M. But you do not feel it until a nerve reports the hurt to the brain. Yet the brain is the seat of the mind, is it not?", "764": "Y.M. I think so.", "765": "O.M. But isn't spiritual enough to learn what is happening in the outskirts without the help of the physical messenger? You perceive that the question of who or what the Me is, is not a simple one at all. You say \u201cI admire the rainbow,\u201d and \u201cI believe the world is round,\u201d and in these cases we find that the Me is not speaking, but only the mental part. You say, \u201cI grieve,\u201d and again the Me is not all speaking, but only the moral part. You say the mind is wholly spiritual; then you say \u201cI have a pain\u201d and find that this time the Me is mental and spiritual combined. We all use the \u201cI\u201d in this indeterminate fashion, there is no help for it. We imagine a Master and King over what you call The Whole Thing, and we speak of him as \u201cI,\u201d but when we try to define him we find we cannot do it. The intellect and the feelings can act quite independently of each other; we recognize that, and we look around for a Ruler who is master over both, and can serve as a definite and indisputable \u201cI,\u201d and enable us to know what we mean and who or what we are talking about when we use that pronoun, but we have to give it up and confess that we cannot find him. To me, Man is a machine, made up of many mechanisms, the moral and mental ones acting automatically in accordance with the impulses of an interior Master who is built out of born-temperament and an accumulation of multitudinous outside influences and trainings; a machine whose one function is to secure the spiritual contentment of the Master, be his desires good or be they evil; a machine whose Will is absolute and must be obeyed, and always is obeyed.", "766": "Y.M. Maybe the Me is the Soul?", "767": "O.M. Maybe it is. What is the Soul?", "768": "Y.M. I don't know.", "769": "O.M. Neither does any one else.", "770": "The Master Passion", "771": "Y.M. What is the Master?\u2014or, in common speech, the Conscience? Explain it.", "772": "O.M. It is that mysterious autocrat, lodged in a man, which compels the man to content its desires. It may be called the Master Passion\u2014the hunger for Self-Approval.", "773": "Y.M. Where is its seat?", "774": "O.M. In man's moral constitution.", "775": "Y.M. Are its commands for the man's good?", "776": "O.M. It is indifferent to the man's good; it never concerns itself about anything but the satisfying of its own desires. It can be trained to prefer things which will be for the man's good, but it will prefer them only because they will content it better than other things would.", "777": "Y.M. Then even when it is trained to high ideals it is still looking out for its own contentment, and not for the man's good.", "778": "O.M. True. Trained or untrained, it cares nothing for the man's good, and never concerns itself about it.", "779": "Y.M. It seems to be an immoral force seated in the man's moral constitution.", "780": "O.M. It is a colorless force seated in the man's moral constitution. Let us call it an instinct\u2014a blind, unreasoning instinct, which cannot and does not distinguish between good morals and bad ones, and cares nothing for results to the man provided its own contentment be secured; and it will always secure that.", "781": "Y.M. It seeks money, and it probably considers that that is an advantage for the man?", "782": "O.M. It is not always seeking money, it is not always seeking power, nor office, nor any other material advantage. In all cases it seeks a spiritual contentment, let the means be what they may. Its desires are determined by the man's temperament\u2014and it is lord over that. Temperament, Conscience, Susceptibility, Spiritual Appetite, are, in fact, the same thing. Have you ever heard of a person who cared nothing for money?", "783": "Y.M. Yes. A scholar who would not leave his garret and his books to take a place in a business house at a large salary.", "784": "O.M. He had to satisfy his master\u2014that is to say, his temperament, his Spiritual Appetite\u2014and it preferred books to money. Are there other cases?", "785": "Y.M. Yes, the hermit.", "786": "O.M. It is a good instance. The hermit endures solitude, hunger, cold, and manifold perils, to content his autocrat, who prefers these things, and prayer and contemplation, to money or to any show or luxury that money can buy. Are there others?", "787": "Y.M. Yes. The artist, the poet, the scientist.", "788": "O.M. Their autocrat prefers the deep pleasures of these occupations, either well paid or ill paid, to any others in the market, at any price. You realize that the Master Passion\u2014the contentment of the spirit\u2014concerns itself with many things besides so-called material advantage, material prosperity, cash, and all that?", "789": "Y.M. I think I must concede it.", "790": "O.M. I believe you must. There are perhaps as many Temperaments that would refuse the burdens and vexations and distinctions of public office as there are that hunger after them. The one set of Temperaments seek the contentment of the spirit, and that alone; and this is exactly the case with the other set. Neither set seeks anything but the contentment of the spirit. If the one is sordid, both are sordid; and equally so, since the end in view is precisely the same in both cases. And in both cases Temperament decides the preference\u2014and Temperament is born, not made.", "791": "Conclusion", "792": "O.M. You have been taking a holiday?", "793": "Y.M. Yes; a mountain tramp covering a week. Are you ready to talk?", "794": "O.M. Quite ready. What shall we begin with?", "795": "Y.M. Well, lying abed resting up, two days and nights, I have thought over all these talks, and passed them carefully in review. With this result: that... that... are you intending to publish your notions about Man some day?", "796": "O.M. Now and then, in these past twenty years, the Master inside of me has half-intended to order me to set them to paper and publish them. Do I have to tell you why the order has remained unissued, or can you explain so simple a thing without my help?", "797": "Y.M. By your doctrine, it is simplicity itself: outside influences moved your interior Master to give the order; stronger outside influences deterred him. Without the outside influences, neither of these impulses could ever have been born, since a person's brain is incapable or originating an idea within itself.", "798": "O.M. Correct. Go on.", "799": "Y.M. The matter of publishing or withholding is still in your Master's hands. If some day an outside influence shall determine him to publish, he will give the order, and it will be obeyed.", "800": "O.M. That is correct. Well?", "801": "Y.M. Upon reflection I have arrived at the conviction that the publication of your doctrines would be harmful. Do you pardon me?", "802": "O.M. Pardon you? You have done nothing. You are an instrument\u2014a speaking-trumpet. Speaking-trumpets are not responsible for what is said through them. Outside influences\u2014in the form of lifelong teachings, trainings, notions, prejudices, and other second-hand importations\u2014have persuaded the Master within you that the publication of these doctrines would be harmful. Very well, this is quite natural, and was to be expected; in fact, was inevitable. Go on; for the sake of ease and convenience, stick to habit: speak in the first person, and tell me what your Master thinks about it.", "803": "Y.M. Well, to begin: it is a desolating doctrine; it is not inspiring, enthusing, uplifting. It takes the glory out of man, it takes the pride out of him, it takes the heroism out of him, it denies him all personal credit, all applause; it not only degrades him to a machine, but allows him no control over the machine; makes a mere coffee-mill of him, and neither permits him to supply the coffee nor turn the crank, his sole and piteously humble function being to grind coarse or fine, according to his make, outside impulses doing the rest.", "804": "O.M. It is correctly stated. Tell me\u2014what do men admire most in each other?", "805": "Y.M. Intellect, courage, majesty of build, beauty of countenance, charity, benevolence, magnanimity, kindliness, heroism, and\u2014and\u2014", "806": "O.M. I would not go any further. These are elementals. Virtue, fortitude, holiness, truthfulness, loyalty, high ideals\u2014these, and all the related qualities that are named in the dictionary, are made of the elementals, by blendings, combinations, and shadings of the elementals, just as one makes green by blending blue and yellow, and makes several shades and tints of red by modifying the elemental red. There are several elemental colors; they are all in the rainbow; out of them we manufacture and name fifty shades of them. You have named the elementals of the human rainbow, and also one blend \u2014heroism, which is made out of courage and magnanimity. Very well, then; which of these elements does the possessor of it manufacture for himself? Is it intellect?", "807": "Y.M. No.", "808": "O.M. Why?", "809": "Y.M. He is born with it.", "810": "O.M. Is it courage?", "811": "Y.M. No. He is born with it.", "812": "O.M. Is it majesty of build, beauty of countenance?", "813": "Y.M. No. They are birthrights.", "814": "O.M. Take those others\u2014the elemental moral qualities\u2014charity, benevolence, magnanimity, kindliness; fruitful seeds, out of which spring, through cultivation by outside influences, all the manifold blends and combinations of virtues named in the dictionaries: does man manufacture any of those seeds, or are they all born in him?", "815": "Y.M. Born in him.", "816": "O.M. Who manufactures them, then?", "817": "Y.M. God.", "818": "O.M. Where does the credit of it belong?", "819": "Y.M. To God.", "820": "O.M. And the glory of which you spoke, and the applause?", "821": "Y.M. To God.", "822": "O.M. Then it is you who degrade man. You make him claim glory, praise, flattery, for every valuable thing he possesses\u2014borrowed finery, the whole of it; no rag of it earned by himself, not a detail of it produced by his own labor. You make man a humbug; have I done worse by him?", "823": "Y.M. You have made a machine of him.", "824": "O.M. Who devised that cunning and beautiful mechanism, a man's hand?", "825": "Y.M. God.", "826": "O.M. Who devised the law by which it automatically hammers out of a piano an elaborate piece of music, without error, while the man is thinking about something else, or talking to a friend?", "827": "Y.M. God.", "828": "O.M. Who devised the blood? Who devised the wonderful machinery which automatically drives its renewing and refreshing streams through the body, day and night, without assistance or advice from the man? Who devised the man's mind, whose machinery works automatically, interests itself in what it pleases, regardless of its will or desire, labors all night when it likes, deaf to his appeals for mercy? God devised all these things. I have not made man a machine, God made him a machine. I am merely calling attention to the fact, nothing more. Is it wrong to call attention to the fact? Is it a crime?", "829": "Y.M. I think it is wrong to expose a fact when harm can come of it.", "830": "O.M. Go on.", "831": "Y.M. Look at the matter as it stands now. Man has been taught that he is the supreme marvel of the Creation; he believes it; in all the ages he has never doubted it, whether he was a naked savage, or clothed in purple and fine linen, and civilized. This has made his heart buoyant, his life cheery. His pride in himself, his sincere admiration of himself, his joy in what he supposed were his own and unassisted achievements, and his exultation over the praise and applause which they evoked\u2014these have exalted him, enthused him, ambitioned him to higher and higher flights; in a word, made his life worth the living. But by your scheme, all this is abolished; he is degraded to a machine, he is a nobody, his noble prides wither to mere vanities; let him strive as he may, he can never be any better than his humblest and stupidest neighbor; he would never be cheerful again, his life would not be worth the living.", "832": "O.M. You really think that?", "833": "Y.M. I certainly do.", "834": "O.M. Have you ever seen me uncheerful, unhappy.", "835": "Y.M. No.", "836": "O.M. Well, I believe these things. Why have they not made me unhappy?", "837": "Y.M. Oh, well\u2014temperament, of course! You never let that escape from your scheme.", "838": "O.M. That is correct. If a man is born with an unhappy temperament, nothing can make him happy; if he is born with a happy temperament, nothing can make him unhappy.", "839": "Y.M. What\u2014not even a degrading and heart-chilling system of beliefs?", "840": "O.M. Beliefs? Mere beliefs? Mere convictions? They are powerless. They strive in vain against inborn temperament.", "841": "Y.M. I can't believe that, and I don't.", "842": "O.M. Now you are speaking hastily. It shows that you have not studiously examined the facts. Of all your intimates, which one is the happiest? Isn't it Burgess?", "843": "Y.M. Easily.", "844": "O.M. And which one is the unhappiest? Henry Adams?", "845": "Y.M. Without a question!", "846": "O.M. I know them well. They are extremes, abnormals; their temperaments are as opposite as the poles. Their life-histories are about alike\u2014but look at the results! Their ages are about the same\u2014about around fifty. Burgess had always been buoyant, hopeful, happy; Adams has always been cheerless, hopeless, despondent. As young fellows both tried country journalism\u2014and failed. Burgess didn't seem to mind it; Adams couldn't smile, he could only mourn and groan over what had happened and torture himself with vain regrets for not having done so and so instead of so and so\u2014then he would have succeeded. They tried the law\u2014and failed. Burgess remained happy\u2014because he couldn't help it. Adams was wretched\u2014because he couldn't help it. From that day to this, those two men have gone on trying things and failing: Burgess has come out happy and cheerful every time; Adams the reverse. And we do absolutely know that these men's inborn temperaments have remained unchanged through all the vicissitudes of their material affairs. Let us see how it is with their immaterials. Both have been zealous Democrats; both have been zealous Republicans; both have been zealous Mugwumps. Burgess has always found happiness and Adams unhappiness in these several political beliefs and in their migrations out of them. Both of these men have been Presbyterians, Universalists, Methodists, Catholics\u2014then Presbyterians again, then Methodists again. Burgess has always found rest in these excursions, and Adams unrest. They are trying Christian Science, now, with the customary result, the inevitable result. No political or religious belief can make Burgess unhappy or the other man happy. I assure you it is purely a matter of temperament. Beliefs are acquirements, temperaments are born; beliefs are subject to change, nothing whatever can change temperament.", "847": "Y.M. You have instanced extreme temperaments.", "848": "O.M. Yes, the half-dozen others are modifications of the extremes. But the law is the same. Where the temperament is two-thirds happy, or two-thirds unhappy, no political or religious beliefs can change the proportions. The vast majority of temperaments are pretty equally balanced; the intensities are absent, and this enables a nation to learn to accommodate itself to its political and religious circumstances and like them, be satisfied with them, at last prefer them. Nations do not think, they only feel. They get their feelings at second hand through their temperaments, not their brains. A nation can be brought\u2014by force of circumstances, not argument\u2014to reconcile itself to any kind of government or religion that can be devised; in time it will fit itself to the required conditions; later, it will prefer them and will fiercely fight for them. As instances, you have all history: the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Russians, the Germans, the French, the English, the Spaniards, the Americans, the South Americans, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Hindus, the Turks\u2014a thousand wild and tame religions, every kind of government that can be thought of, from tiger to house-cat, each nation knowing it has the only true religion and the only sane system of government, each despising all the others, each an ass and not suspecting it, each proud of its fancied supremacy, each perfectly sure it is the pet of God, each without undoubting confidence summoning Him to take command in time of war, each surprised when He goes over to the enemy, but by habit able to excuse it and resume compliments\u2014in a word, the whole human race content, always content, persistently content, indestructibly content, happy, thankful, proud, no matter what its religion is, nor whether its master be tiger or house-cat. Am I stating facts? You know I am. Is the human race cheerful? You know it is. Considering what it can stand, and be happy, you do me too much honor when you think that I can place before it a system of plain cold facts that can take the cheerfulness out of it. Nothing can do that. Everything has been tried. Without success. I beg you not to be troubled."}, "THE DEATH OF JEAN": {"0": "The death of Jean Clemens occurred early in the morning of December 24, 1909. Mr. Clemens was in great stress of mind when I first saw him, but a few hours later I found him writing steadily.", "1": "\u201cI am setting it down,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything. It is a relief to me to write it. It furnishes me an excuse for thinking.\u201d At intervals during that day and the next I looked in, and usually found him writing. Then on the evening of the 26th, when he knew that Jean had been laid to rest in Elmira, he came to my room with the manuscript in his hand.", "2": "\u201cI have finished it,\u201d he said; \u201cread it. I can form no opinion of it myself. If you think it worthy, some day\u2014at the proper time\u2014it can end my autobiography. It is the final chapter.\u201d", "3": "Four months later\u2014almost to the day\u2014(April 21st) he was with Jean.", "4": "Albert Bigelow Paine.", "5": "Stormfield, Christmas Eve, 11 A.M., 1909.", "6": "JEAN IS DEAD!", "7": "Has any one ever tried to put upon paper all the little happenings connected with a dear one\u2014happenings of the twenty-four hours preceding the sudden and unexpected death of that dear one? Would a book contain them? Would two books contain them? I think not. They pour into the mind in a flood. They are little things that have been always happening every day, and were always so unimportant and easily forgettable before\u2014but now! Now, how different! how precious they are, how dear, how unforgettable, how pathetic, how sacred, how clothed with dignity!", "8": "Last night Jean, all flushed with splendid health, and I the same, from the wholesome effects of my Bermuda holiday, strolled hand in hand from the dinner-table and sat down in the library and chatted, and planned, and discussed, cheerily and happily (and how unsuspectingly!)\u2014until nine\u2014which is late for us\u2014then went upstairs, Jean's friendly German dog following. At my door Jean said, \u201cI can't kiss you good night, father: I have a cold, and you could catch it.\u201d I bent and kissed her hand. She was moved\u2014I saw it in her eyes\u2014and she impulsively kissed my hand in return. Then with the usual gay \u201cSleep well, dear!\u201d from both, we parted.", "9": "At half past seven this morning I woke, and heard voices outside my door. I said to myself, \u201cJean is starting on her usual horseback flight to the station for the mail.\u201d Then Katy (1) entered, stood quaking and gasping at my bedside a moment, then found her tongue:", "10": "\u201cMISS JEAN IS DEAD!\u201d", "11": "Possibly I know now what the soldier feels when a bullet crashes through his heart.", "12": "In her bathroom there she lay, the fair young creature, stretched upon the floor and covered with a sheet. And looking so placid, so natural, and as if asleep. We knew what had happened. She was an epileptic: she had been seized with a convulsion and heart failure in her bath. The doctor had to come several miles. His efforts, like our previous ones, failed to bring her back to life.", "13": "It is noon, now. How lovable she looks, how sweet and how tranquil! It is a noble face, and full of dignity; and that was a good heart that lies there so still.", "14": "In England, thirteen years ago, my wife and I were stabbed to the heart with a cablegram which said, \u201cSusy was mercifully released today.\u201d I had to send a like shot to Clara, in Berlin, this morning. With the peremptory addition, \u201cYou must not come home.\u201d Clara and her husband sailed from here on the 11th of this month. How will Clara bear it? Jean, from her babyhood, was a worshiper of Clara.", "15": "Four days ago I came back from a month's holiday in Bermuda in perfected health; but by some accident the reporters failed to perceive this. Day before yesterday, letters and telegrams began to arrive from friends and strangers which indicated that I was supposed to be dangerously ill. Yesterday Jean begged me to explain my case through the Associated Press. I said it was not important enough; but she was distressed and said I must think of Clara. Clara would see the report in the German papers, and as she had been nursing her husband day and night for four months (2) and was worn out and feeble, the shock might be disastrous. There was reason in that; so I sent a humorous paragraph by telephone to the Associated Press denying the \u201ccharge\u201d that I was \u201cdying,\u201d and saying \u201cI would not do such a thing at my time of life.\u201d", "16": "Jean was a little troubled, and did not like to see me treat the matter so lightly; but I said it was best to treat it so, for there was nothing serious about it. This morning I sent the sorrowful facts of this day's irremediable disaster to the Associated Press. Will both appear in this evening's papers?\u2014the one so blithe, the other so tragic?", "17": "I lost Susy thirteen years ago; I lost her mother\u2014her incomparable mother!\u2014five and a half years ago; Clara has gone away to live in Europe; and now I have lost Jean. How poor I am, who was once so rich! Seven months ago Mr. Rogers died\u2014one of the best friends I ever had, and the nearest perfect, as man and gentleman, I have yet met among my race; within the last six weeks Gilder has passed away, and Laffan\u2014old, old friends of mine. Jean lies yonder, I sit here; we are strangers under our own roof; we kissed hands good-by at this door last night\u2014and it was forever, we never suspecting it. She lies there, and I sit here\u2014writing, busying myself, to keep my heart from breaking. How dazzlingly the sunshine is flooding the hills around! It is like a mockery.", "18": "Seventy-four years old twenty-four days ago. Seventy-four years old yesterday. Who can estimate my age today?", "19": "I have looked upon her again. I wonder I can bear it. She looks just as her mother looked when she lay dead in that Florentine villa so long ago. The sweet placidity of death! it is more beautiful than sleep.", "20": "I saw her mother buried. I said I would never endure that horror again; that I would never again look into the grave of any one dear to me. I have kept to that. They will take Jean from this house tomorrow, and bear her to Elmira, New York, where lie those of us that have been released, but I shall not follow.", "21": "Jean was on the dock when the ship came in, only four days ago. She was at the door, beaming a welcome, when I reached this house the next evening. We played cards, and she tried to teach me a new game called \u201cMark Twain.\u201d We sat chatting cheerily in the library last night, and she wouldn't let me look into the loggia, where she was making Christmas preparations. She said she would finish them in the morning, and then her little French friend would arrive from New York\u2014the surprise would follow; the surprise she had been working over for days. While she was out for a moment I disloyally stole a look. The loggia floor was clothed with rugs and furnished with chairs and sofas; and the uncompleted surprise was there: in the form of a Christmas tree that was drenched with silver film in a most wonderful way; and on a table was a prodigal profusion of bright things which she was going to hang upon it today. What desecrating hand will ever banish that eloquent unfinished surprise from that place? Not mine, surely. All these little matters have happened in the last four days. \u201cLittle.\u201d Yes\u2014then. But not now. Nothing she said or thought or did is little now. And all the lavish humor!\u2014what is become of it? It is pathos, now. Pathos, and the thought of it brings tears.", "22": "All these little things happened such a few hours ago\u2014and now she lies yonder. Lies yonder, and cares for nothing any more. Strange\u2014marvelous\u2014incredible! I have had this experience before; but it would still be incredible if I had had it a thousand times.", "23": "\u201cMISS JEAN IS DEAD!\u201d", "24": "That is what Katy said. When I heard the door open behind the bed's head without a preliminary knock, I supposed it was Jean coming to kiss me good morning, she being the only person who was used to entering without formalities.", "25": "And so\u2014", "26": "I have been to Jean's parlor. Such a turmoil of Christmas presents for servants and friends! They are everywhere; tables, chairs, sofas, the floor\u2014everything is occupied, and over-occupied. It is many and many a year since I have seen the like. In that ancient day Mrs. Clemens and I used to slip softly into the nursery at midnight on Christmas Eve and look the array of presents over. The children were little then. And now here is Jean's parlor looking just as that nursery used to look. The presents are not labeled\u2014the hands are forever idle that would have labeled them today. Jean's mother always worked herself down with her Christmas preparations. Jean did the same yesterday and the preceding days, and the fatigue has cost her her life. The fatigue caused the convulsion that attacked her this morning. She had had no attack for months.", "27": "Jean was so full of life and energy that she was constantly in danger of overtaxing her strength. Every morning she was in the saddle by half past seven, and off to the station for her mail. She examined the letters and I distributed them: some to her, some to Mr. Paine, the others to the stenographer and myself. She dispatched her share and then mounted her horse again and went around superintending her farm and her poultry the rest of the day. Sometimes she played billiards with me after dinner, but she was usually too tired to play, and went early to bed.", "28": "Yesterday afternoon I told her about some plans I had been devising while absent in Bermuda, to lighten her burdens. We would get a housekeeper; also we would put her share of the secretary-work into Mr. Paine's hands.", "29": "No\u2014she wasn't willing. She had been making plans herself. The matter ended in a compromise, I submitted. I always did. She wouldn't audit the bills and let Paine fill out the checks\u2014she would continue to attend to that herself. Also, she would continue to be housekeeper, and let Katy assist. Also, she would continue to answer the letters of personal friends for me. Such was the compromise. Both of us called it by that name, though I was not able to see where any formidable change had been made.", "30": "However, Jean was pleased, and that was sufficient for me. She was proud of being my secretary, and I was never able to persuade her to give up any part of her share in that unlovely work.", "31": "In the talk last night I said I found everything going so smoothly that if she were willing I would go back to Bermuda in February and get blessedly out of the clash and turmoil again for another month. She was urgent that I should do it, and said that if I would put off the trip until March she would take Katy and go with me. We struck hands upon that, and said it was settled. I had a mind to write to Bermuda by tomorrow's ship and secure a furnished house and servants. I meant to write the letter this morning. But it will never be written, now.", "32": "For she lies yonder, and before her is another journey than that.", "33": "Night is closing down; the rim of the sun barely shows above the sky-line of the hills.", "34": "I have been looking at that face again that was growing dearer and dearer to me every day. I was getting acquainted with Jean in these last nine months. She had been long an exile from home when she came to us three-quarters of a year ago. She had been shut up in sanitariums, many miles from us. How eloquently glad and grateful she was to cross her father's threshold again!", "35": "Would I bring her back to life if I could do it? I would not. If a word would do it, I would beg for strength to withhold the word. And I would have the strength; I am sure of it. In her loss I am almost bankrupt, and my life is a bitterness, but I am content: for she has been enriched with the most precious of all gifts\u2014that gift which makes all other gifts mean and poor\u2014death. I have never wanted any released friend of mine restored to life since I reached manhood. I felt in this way when Susy passed away; and later my wife, and later Mr. Rogers. When Clara met me at the station in New York and told me Mr. Rogers had died suddenly that morning, my thought was, Oh, favorite of fortune\u2014fortunate all his long and lovely life\u2014fortunate to his latest moment! The reporters said there were tears of sorrow in my eyes. True\u2014but they were for me, not for him. He had suffered no loss. All the fortunes he had ever made before were poverty compared with this one.", "36": "Why did I build this house, two years ago? To shelter this vast emptiness? How foolish I was! But I shall stay in it. The spirits of the dead hallow a house, for me. It was not so with other members of my family. Susy died in the house we built in Hartford. Mrs. Clemens would never enter it again. But it made the house dearer to me. I have entered it once since, when it was tenantless and silent and forlorn, but to me it was a holy place and beautiful. It seemed to me that the spirits of the dead were all about me, and would speak to me and welcome me if they could: Livy, and Susy, and George, and Henry Robinson, and Charles Dudley Warner. How good and kind they were, and how lovable their lives! In fancy I could see them all again, I could call the children back and hear them romp again with George\u2014that peerless black ex-slave and children's idol who came one day\u2014a flitting stranger\u2014to wash windows, and stayed eighteen years. Until he died. Clara and Jean would never enter again the New York hotel which their mother had frequented in earlier days. They could not bear it. But I shall stay in this house. It is dearer to me tonight than ever it was before. Jean's spirit will make it beautiful for me always. Her lonely and tragic death\u2014but I will not think of that now.", "37": "Jean's mother always devoted two or three weeks to Christmas shopping, and was always physically exhausted when Christmas Eve came. Jean was her very own child\u2014she wore herself out present-hunting in New York these latter days.

And Katy found there a roll of bank-notes, for the servants.", "38": "Her dog has been wandering about the grounds today, comradeless and forlorn. I have seen him from the windows. She got him from Germany. He has tall ears and looks exactly like a wolf. He was educated in Germany, and knows no language but the German. Jean gave him no orders save in that tongue. And so when the burglar-alarm made a fierce clamor at midnight a fortnight ago, the butler, who is French and knows no German, tried in vain to interest the dog in the supposed burglar. Jean wrote me, to Bermuda, about the incident. It was the last letter I was ever to receive from her bright head and her competent hand. The dog will not be neglected.", "39": "There was never a kinder heart than Jean's. From her childhood up she always spent the most of her allowance on charities of one kind and another. After she became secretary and had her income doubled she spent her money upon these things with a free hand. Mine too, I am glad and grateful to say.", "40": "She was a loyal friend to all animals, and she loved them all, birds, beasts, and everything\u2014even snakes\u2014an inheritance from me. She knew all the birds; she was high up in that lore. She became a member of various humane societies when she was still a little girl\u2014both here and abroad\u2014and she remained an active member to the last. She founded two or three societies for the protection of animals, here and in Europe.", "41": "She was an embarrassing secretary, for she fished my correspondence out of the waste-basket and answered the letters. She thought all letters deserved the courtesy of an answer. Her mother brought her up in that kindly error.", "42": "She could write a good letter, and was swift with her pen. She had but an indifferent ear for music, but her tongue took to languages with an easy facility. She never allowed her Italian, French, and German to get rusty through neglect.", "43": "The telegrams of sympathy are flowing in, from far and wide, now, just as they did in Italy five years and a half ago, when this child's mother laid down her blameless life. They cannot heal the hurt, but they take away some of the pain. When Jean and I kissed hands and parted at my door last, how little did we imagine that in twenty-two hours the telegraph would be bringing words like these:", "44": "\u201cFrom the bottom of our hearts we send our sympathy, dearest of friends.\u201d", "45": "For many and many a day to come, wherever I go in this house, remembrancers of Jean will mutely speak to me of her. Who can count the number of them?", "46": "She was in exile two years with the hope of healing her malady\u2014epilepsy.

Jean is dead.", "49": "A month ago I was writing bubbling and hilarious articles for magazines yet to appear, and now I am writing\u2014this.", "50": "CHRISTMAS DAY. NOON.\u2014Last night I went to Jean's room at intervals, and turned back the sheet and looked at the peaceful face, and kissed the cold brow, and remembered that heartbreaking night in Florence so long ago, in that cavernous and silent vast villa, when I crept downstairs so many times, and turned back a sheet and looked at a face just like this one\u2014Jean's mother's face\u2014and kissed a brow that was just like this one. And last night I saw again what I had seen then\u2014that strange and lovely miracle\u2014the sweet, soft contours of early maidenhood restored by the gracious hand of death! When Jean's mother lay dead, all trace of care, and trouble, and suffering, and the corroding years had vanished out of the face, and I was looking again upon it as I had known and worshiped it in its young bloom and beauty a whole generation before.", "51": "About three in the morning, while wandering about the house in the deep silences, as one does in times like these, when there is a dumb sense that something has been lost that will never be found again, yet must be sought, if only for the employment the useless seeking gives, I came upon Jean's dog in the hall downstairs, and noted that he did not spring to greet me, according to his hospitable habit, but came slow and sorrowfully; also I remembered that he had not visited Jean's apartment since the tragedy. Poor fellow, did he know? I think so. Always when Jean was abroad in the open he was with her; always when she was in the house he was with her, in the night as well as in the day. Her parlor was his bedroom. Whenever I happened upon him on the ground floor he always followed me about, and when I went upstairs he went too\u2014in a tumultuous gallop. But now it was different: after patting him a little I went to the library\u2014he remained behind; when I went upstairs he did not follow me, save with his wistful eyes. He has wonderful eyes\u2014big, and kind, and eloquent. He can talk with them. He is a beautiful creature, and is of the breed of the New York police-dogs. I do not like dogs, because they bark when there is no occasion for it; but I have liked this one from the beginning, because he belonged to Jean, and because he never barks except when there is occasion\u2014which is not oftener than twice a week.", "52": "In my wanderings I visited Jean's parlor. On a shelf I found a pile of my books, and I knew what it meant. She was waiting for me to come home from Bermuda and autograph them, then she would send them away. If I only knew whom she intended them for! But I shall never know. I will keep them. Her hand has touched them\u2014it is an accolade\u2014they are noble, now.", "53": "And in a closet she had hidden a surprise for me\u2014a thing I have often wished I owned: a noble big globe. I couldn't see it for the tears. She will never know the pride I take in it, and the pleasure. Today the mails are full of loving remembrances for her: full of those old, old kind words she loved so well, \u201cMerry Christmas to Jean!\u201d If she could only have lived one day longer!", "54": "At last she ran out of money, and would not use mine. So she sent to one of those New York homes for poor girls all the clothes she could spare\u2014and more, most likely.", "55": "CHRISTMAS NIGHT.\u2014This afternoon they took her away from her room. As soon as I might, I went down to the library, and there she lay, in her coffin, dressed in exactly the same clothes she wore when she stood at the other end of the same room on the 6th of October last, as Clara's chief bridesmaid. Her face was radiant with happy excitement then; it was the same face now, with the dignity of death and the peace of God upon it.", "56": "They told me the first mourner to come was the dog. He came uninvited, and stood up on his hind legs and rested his fore paws upon the trestle, and took a last long look at the face that was so dear to him, then went his way as silently as he had come. He knows.", "57": "At mid-afternoon it began to snow. The pity of it\u2014that Jean could not see it! She so loved the snow.", "58": "The snow continued to fall. At six o'clock the hearse drew up to the door to bear away its pathetic burden. As they lifted the casket, Paine began playing on the orchestrelle Schubert's \u201cImpromptu,\u201d which was Jean's favorite. Then he played the Intermezzo; that was for Susy; then he played the Largo; that was for their mother. He did this at my request. Elsewhere in my Autobiography I have told how the Intermezzo and the Largo came to be associated in my heart with Susy and Livy in their last hours in this life.", "59": "From my windows I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow, and presently disappear. Jean was gone out of my life, and would not come back any more. Jervis, the cousin she had played with when they were babies together\u2014he and her beloved old Katy\u2014were conducting her to her distant childhood home, where she will lie by her mother's side once more, in the company of Susy and Langdon.", "60": "DECEMBER 26TH. The dog came to see me at eight o'clock this morning. He was very affectionate, poor orphan! My room will be his quarters hereafter.", "61": "The storm raged all night. It has raged all the morning. The snow drives across the landscape in vast clouds, superb, sublime\u2014and Jean not here to see.", "62": "2:30 P.M.\u2014It is the time appointed. The funeral has begun. Four hundred miles away, but I can see it all, just as if I were there. The scene is the library in the Langdon homestead. Jean's coffin stands where her mother and I stood, forty years ago, and were married; and where Susy's coffin stood thirteen years ago; where her mother's stood five years and a half ago; and where mine will stand after a little time.", "63": "FIVE O'CLOCK.\u2014It is all over.", "64": "When Clara went away two weeks ago to live in Europe, it was hard, but I could bear it, for I had Jean left. I said we would be a family. We said we would be close comrades and happy\u2014just we two. That fair dream was in my mind when Jean met me at the steamer last Monday; it was in my mind when she received me at the door last Tuesday evening. We were together; WE WERE A FAMILY! the dream had come true\u2014oh, precisely true, contentedly, true, satisfyingly true! and remained true two whole days.", "65": "And now? Now Jean is in her grave!", "66": "In the grave\u2014if I can believe it. God rest her sweet spirit!"}, "THE TURNING-POINT OF MY LIFE": {"0": "If I understand the idea, the Bazar invites several of us to write upon the above text. It means the change in my life's course which introduced what must be regarded by me as the most important condition of my career. But it also implies\u2014without intention, perhaps\u2014that that turning-point itself was the creator of the new condition. This gives it too much distinction, too much prominence, too much credit. It is only the last link in a very long chain of turning-points commissioned to produce the cardinal result; it is not any more important than the humblest of its ten thousand predecessors. Each of the ten thousand did its appointed share, on its appointed date, in forwarding the scheme, and they were all necessary; to have left out any one of them would have defeated the scheme and brought about some other result. I know we have a fashion of saying \u201csuch and such an event was the turning-point in my life,\u201d but we shouldn't say it. We should merely grant that its place as LAST link in the chain makes it the most conspicuous link; in real importance it has no advantage over any one of its predecessors.", "1": "Perhaps the most celebrated turning-point recorded in history was the crossing of the Rubicon. Suetonius says:", "2": "Coming up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon, he halted for a while, and, revolving in his mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking, he turned to those about him and said, \u201cWe may still retreat; but if we pass this little bridge, nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms.\u201d", "3": "This was a stupendously important moment. And all the incidents, big and little, of Caesar's previous life had been leading up to it, stage by stage, link by link. This was the last link\u2014merely the last one, and no bigger than the others; but as we gaze back at it through the inflating mists of our imagination, it looks as big as the orbit of Neptune.", "4": "You, the reader, have a personal interest in that link, and so have I; so has the rest of the human race. It was one of the links in your life-chain, and it was one of the links in mine. We may wait, now, with bated breath, while Caesar reflects. Your fate and mine are involved in his decision.", "5": "While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person remarked for his noble mien and graceful aspect appeared close at hand, sitting and playing upon a pipe. When not only the shepherds, but a number of soldiers also, flocked to listen to him, and some trumpeters among them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it, and, sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side. Upon this, Caesar exclaimed: \u201cLet us go whither the omens of the gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us. The Die Is Cast.\u201d", "6": "So he crossed\u2014and changed the future of the whole human race, for all time. But that stranger was a link in Caesar's life-chain, too; and a necessary one. We don't know his name, we never hear of him again; he was very casual; he acts like an accident; but he was no accident, he was there by compulsion of HIS life-chain, to blow the electrifying blast that was to make up Caesar's mind for him, and thence go piping down the aisles of history forever.", "7": "If the stranger hadn't been there! But he WAS. And Caesar crossed. With such results! Such vast events\u2014each a link in the human race's life-chain; each event producing the next one, and that one the next one, and so on: the destruction of the republic; the founding of the empire; the breaking up of the empire; the rise of Christianity upon its ruins; the spread of the religion to other lands\u2014and so on; link by link took its appointed place at its appointed time, the discovery of America being one of them; our Revolution another; the inflow of English and other immigrants another; their drift westward (my ancestors among them) another; the settlement of certain of them in Missouri, which resulted in ME. For I was one of the unavoidable results of the crossing of the Rubicon. If the stranger, with his trumpet blast, had stayed away (which he couldn't, for he was an appointed link) Caesar would not have crossed. What would have happened, in that case, we can never guess. We only know that the things that did happen would not have happened. They might have been replaced by equally prodigious things, of course, but their nature and results are beyond our guessing. But the matter that interests me personally is that I would not be here now, but somewhere else; and probably black\u2014there is no telling. Very well, I am glad he crossed. And very really and thankfully glad, too, though I never cared anything about it before.", "8": "II", "9": "To me, the most important feature of my life is its literary feature. I have been professionally literary something more than forty years. There have been many turning-points in my life, but the one that was the last link in the chain appointed to conduct me to the literary guild is the most conspicuous link in that chain. because it was the last one. It was not any more important than its predecessors. All the other links have an inconspicuous look, except the crossing of the Rubicon; but as factors in making me literary they are all of the one size, the crossing of the Rubicon included.", "10": "I know how I came to be literary, and I will tell the steps that lead up to it and brought it about.", "11": "The crossing of the Rubicon was not the first one, it was hardly even a recent one; I should have to go back ages before Caesar's day to find the first one. To save space I will go back only a couple of generations and start with an incident of my boyhood. When I was twelve and a half years old, my father died. It was in the spring. The summer came, and brought with it an epidemic of measles. For a time a child died almost every day. The village was paralyzed with fright, distress, despair. Children that were not smitten with the disease were imprisoned in their homes to save them from the infection. In the homes there were no cheerful faces, there was no music, there was no singing but of solemn hymns, no voice but of prayer, no romping was allowed, no noise, no laughter, the family moved spectrally about on tiptoe, in a ghostly hush. I was a prisoner. My soul was steeped in this awful dreariness\u2014and in fear. At some time or other every day and every night a sudden shiver shook me to the marrow, and I said to myself, \u201cThere, I've got it! and I shall die.\u201d Life on these miserable terms was not worth living, and at last I made up my mind to get the disease and have it over, one way or the other. I escaped from the house and went to the house of a neighbor where a playmate of mine was very ill with the malady. When the chance offered I crept into his room and got into bed with him. I was discovered by his mother and sent back into captivity. But I had the disease; they could not take that from me. I came near to dying. The whole village was interested, and anxious, and sent for news of me every day; and not only once a day, but several times. Everybody believed I would die; but on the fourteenth day a change came for the worse and they were disappointed.", "12": "This was a turning-point of my life. (Link number one.) For when I got well my mother closed my school career and apprenticed me to a printer. She was tired of trying to keep me out of mischief, and the adventure of the measles decided her to put me into more masterful hands than hers.", "13": "I became a printer, and began to add one link after another to the chain which was to lead me into the literary profession. A long road, but I could not know that; and as I did not know what its goal was, or even that it had one, I was indifferent. Also contented.", "14": "A young printer wanders around a good deal, seeking and finding work; and seeking again, when necessity commands. N. B. Necessity is a CIRCUMSTANCE; Circumstance is man's master\u2014and when Circumstance commands, he must obey; he may argue the matter\u2014that is his privilege, just as it is the honorable privilege of a falling body to argue with the attraction of gravitation\u2014but it won't do any good, he must OBEY. I wandered for ten years, under the guidance and dictatorship of Circumstance, and finally arrived in a city of Iowa, where I worked several months. Among the books that interested me in those days was one about the Amazon. The traveler told an alluring tale of his long voyage up the great river from Para to the sources of the Madeira, through the heart of an enchanted land, a land wastefully rich in tropical wonders, a romantic land where all the birds and flowers and animals were of the museum varieties, and where the alligator and the crocodile and the monkey seemed as much at home as if they were in the Zoo. Also, he told an astonishing tale about COCA, a vegetable product of miraculous powers, asserting that it was so nourishing and so strength-giving that the native of the mountains of the Madeira region would tramp up hill and down all day on a pinch of powdered coca and require no other sustenance.", "15": "I was fired with a longing to ascend the Amazon. Also with a longing to open up a trade in coca with all the world. During months I dreamed that dream, and tried to contrive ways to get to Para and spring that splendid enterprise upon an unsuspecting planet. But all in vain. A person may PLAN as much as he wants to, but nothing of consequence is likely to come of it until the magician circumstance steps in and takes the matter off his hands. At last Circumstance came to my help. It was in this way. Circumstance, to help or hurt another man, made him lose a fifty-dollar bill in the street; and to help or hurt me, made me find it. I advertised the find, and left for the Amazon the same day. This was another turning-point, another link.", "16": "Could Circumstance have ordered another dweller in that town to go to the Amazon and open up a world-trade in coca on a fifty-dollar basis and been obeyed? No, I was the only one. There were other fools there\u2014shoals and shoals of them\u2014but they were not of my kind. I was the only one of my kind.", "17": "Circumstance is powerful, but it cannot work alone; it has to have a partner. Its partner is man's temperament\u2014his natural disposition. His temperament is not his invention, it is born in him, and he has no authority over it, neither is he responsible for its acts. He cannot change it, nothing can change it, nothing can modify it\u2014except temporarily. But it won't stay modified. It is permanent, like the color of the man's eyes and the shape of his ears. Blue eyes are gray in certain unusual lights; but they resume their natural color when that stress is removed.", "18": "A Circumstance that will coerce one man will have no effect upon a man of a different temperament. If Circumstance had thrown the bank-note in Caesar's way, his temperament would not have made him start for the Amazon. His temperament would have compelled him to do something with the money, but not that. It might have made him advertise the note\u2014and WAIT. We can't tell. Also, it might have made him go to New York and buy into the Government, with results that would leave Tweed nothing to learn when it came his turn.", "19": "Very well, Circumstance furnished the capital, and my temperament told me what to do with it. Sometimes a temperament is an ass. When that is the case the owner of it is an ass, too, and is going to remain one. Training, experience, association, can temporarily so polish him, improve him, exalt him that people will think he is a mule, but they will be mistaken. Artificially he IS a mule, for the time being, but at bottom he is an ass yet, and will remain one.", "20": "By temperament I was the kind of person that DOES things. Does them, and reflects afterward. So I started for the Amazon without reflecting and without asking any questions. That was more than fifty years ago. In all that time my temperament has not changed, by even a shade. I have been punished many and many a time, and bitterly, for doing things and reflecting afterward, but these tortures have been of no value to me; I still do the thing commanded by Circumstance and Temperament, and reflect afterward. Always violently. When I am reflecting, on those occasions, even deaf persons can hear me think.", "21": "I went by the way of Cincinnati, and down the Ohio and Mississippi. My idea was to take ship, at New Orleans, for Para. In New Orleans I inquired, and found there was no ship leaving for Para. Also, that there never had BEEN one leaving for Para. I reflected. A policeman came and asked me what I was doing, and I told him. He made me move on, and said if he caught me reflecting in the public street again he would run me in.", "22": "After a few days I was out of money. Then Circumstance arrived, with another turning-point of my life\u2014a new link. On my way down, I had made the acquaintance of a pilot. I begged him to teach me the river, and he consented. I became a pilot.", "23": "By and by Circumstance came again\u2014introducing the Civil War, this time, in order to push me ahead another stage or two toward the literary profession. The boats stopped running, my livelihood was gone.", "24": "Circumstance came to the rescue with a new turning-point and a fresh link. My brother was appointed secretary to the new Territory of Nevada, and he invited me to go with him and help him in his office. I accepted.", "25": "In Nevada, Circumstance furnished me the silver fever and I went into the mines to make a fortune, as I supposed; but that was not the idea. The idea was to advance me another step toward literature. For amusement I scribbled things for the Virginia City Enterprise. One isn't a printer ten years without setting up acres of good and bad literature, and learning\u2014unconsciously at first, consciously later\u2014to discriminate between the two, within his mental limitations; and meantime he is unconsciously acquiring what is called a \u201cstyle.\u201d One of my efforts attracted attention, and the Enterprise sent for me and put me on its staff.", "26": "And so I became a journalist\u2014another link. By and by Circumstance and the Sacramento union sent me to the Sandwich Islands for five or six months, to write up sugar. I did it; and threw in a good deal of extraneous matter that hadn't anything to do with sugar. But it was this extraneous matter that helped me to another link.", "27": "It made me notorious, and San Francisco invited me to lecture. Which I did. And profitably. I had long had a desire to travel and see the world, and now Circumstance had most kindly and unexpectedly hurled me upon the platform and furnished me the means. So I joined the \u201cQuaker City Excursion.\u201d", "28": "When I returned to America, Circumstance was waiting on the pier\u2014with the last link\u2014the conspicuous, the consummating, the victorious link: I was asked to write a book, and I did it, and called it The Innocents Abroad. Thus I became at last a member of the literary guild. That was forty-two years ago, and I have been a member ever since. Leaving the Rubicon incident away back where it belongs, I can say with truth that the reason I am in the literary profession is because I had the measles when I was twelve years old.", "29": "III", "30": "Now what interests me, as regards these details, is not the details themselves, but the fact that none of them was foreseen by me, none of them was planned by me, I was the author of none of them. Circumstance, working in harness with my temperament, created them all and compelled them all. I often offered help, and with the best intentions, but it was rejected\u2014as a rule, uncourteously. I could never plan a thing and get it to come out the way I planned it. It came out some other way\u2014some way I had not counted upon.", "31": "And so I do not admire the human being\u2014as an intellectual marvel\u2014as much as I did when I was young, and got him out of books, and did not know him personally. When I used to read that such and such a general did a certain brilliant thing, I believed it. Whereas it was not so. Circumstance did it by help of his temperament. The circumstance would have failed of effect with a general of another temperament: he might see the chance, but lose the advantage by being by nature too slow or too quick or too doubtful. Once General Grant was asked a question about a matter which had been much debated by the public and the newspapers; he answered the question without any hesitancy. \u201cGeneral, who planned the march through Georgia?\u201d \u201cThe enemy!\u201d He added that the enemy usually makes your plans for you. He meant that the enemy by neglect or through force of circumstances leaves an opening for you, and you see your chance and take advantage of it.", "32": "Circumstances do the planning for us all, no doubt, by help of our temperaments. I see no great difference between a man and a watch, except that the man is conscious and the watch isn't, and the man TRIES to plan things and the watch doesn't. The watch doesn't wind itself and doesn't regulate itself\u2014these things are done exteriorly. Outside influences, outside circumstances, wind the MAN and regulate him. Left to himself, he wouldn't get regulated at all, and the sort of time he would keep would not be valuable. Some rare men are wonderful watches, with gold case, compensation balance, and all those things, and some men are only simple and sweet and humble Waterburys. I am a Waterbury. A Waterbury of that kind, some say.", "33": "A nation is only an individual multiplied. It makes plans and Circumstance comes and upsets them\u2014or enlarges them. Some patriots throw the tea overboard; some other patriots destroy a Bastille. The PLANS stop there; then Circumstance comes in, quite unexpectedly, and turns these modest riots into a revolution.", "34": "And there was poor Columbus. He elaborated a deep plan to find a new route to an old country. Circumstance revised his plan for him, and he found a new world. And he gets the credit of it to this day. He hadn't anything to do with it.", "35": "Necessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life (and of yours) was the Garden of Eden. It was there that the first link was forged of the chain that was ultimately to lead to the emptying of me into the literary guild. Adam's TEMPERAMENT was the first command the Deity ever issued to a human being on this planet. And it was the only command Adam would NEVER be able to disobey. It said, \u201cBe weak, be water, be characterless, be cheaply persuadable.\u201d The latter command, to let the fruit alone, was certain to be disobeyed. Not by Adam himself, but by his temperament\u2014which he did not create and had no authority over. For the temperament is the man; the thing tricked out with clothes and named Man is merely its Shadow, nothing more. The law of the tiger's temperament is, Thou shalt kill; the law of the sheep's temperament is Thou shalt not kill. To issue later commands requiring the tiger to let the fat stranger alone, and requiring the sheep to imbue its hands in the blood of the lion is not worth while, for those commands can'T be obeyed. They would invite to violations of the law of temperament, which is supreme, and takes precedence of all other authorities. I cannot help feeling disappointed in Adam and Eve. That is, in their temperaments. Not in them, poor helpless young creatures\u2014afflicted with temperaments made out of butter; which butter was commanded to get into contact with fire and be melted. What I cannot help wishing is, that Adam and EVE had been postponed, and Martin Luther and Joan of Arc put in their place\u2014that splendid pair equipped with temperaments not made of butter, but of asbestos. By neither sugary persuasions nor by hell fire could Satan have beguiled them to eat the apple. There would have been results! Indeed, yes. The apple would be intact today; there would be no human race; there would be no YOU; there would be no me. And the old, old creation-dawn scheme of ultimately launching me into the literary guild would have been defeated."}, "HOW TO MAKE HISTORY DATES STICK": {"0": "These chapters are for children, and I shall try to make the words large enough to command respect. In the hope that you are listening, and that you have confidence in me, I will proceed. Dates are difficult things to acquire; and after they are acquired it is difficult to keep them in the head. But they are very valuable. They are like the cattle-pens of a ranch\u2014they shut in the several brands of historical cattle, each within its own fence, and keep them from getting mixed together. Dates are hard to remember because they consist of figures; figures are monotonously unstriking in appearance, and they don't take hold, they form no pictures, and so they give the eye no chance to help. Pictures are the thing. Pictures can make dates stick. They can make nearly anything stick\u2014particularly if you make the pictures yourself. Indeed, that is the great point\u2014make the pictures yourself. I know about this from experience. Thirty years ago I was delivering a memorized lecture every night, and every night I had to help myself with a page of notes to keep from getting myself mixed. The notes consisted of beginnings of sentences, and were eleven in number, and they ran something like this:", "1": "\u201cIn that region the weather\u2014\u201d \u201cat that time it was a custom\u2014\u201d \u201cbut in california one never heard\u2014\u201d", "2": "Eleven of them. They initialed the brief divisions of the lecture and protected me against skipping. But they all looked about alike on the page; they formed no picture; I had them by heart, but I could never with certainty remember the order of their succession; therefore I always had to keep those notes by me and look at them every little while. Once I mislaid them; you will not be able to imagine the terrors of that evening. I now saw that I must invent some other protection. So I got ten of the initial letters by heart in their proper order\u2014I, A, B, and so on\u2014and I went on the platform the next night with these marked in ink on my ten finger-nails. But it didn't answer. I kept track of the fingers for a while; then I lost it, and after that I was never quite sure which finger I had used last. I couldn't lick off a letter after using it, for while they could have made success certain it would also have provoked too much curiosity. There was curiosity enough without that. To the audience I seemed more interested in my fingernails than I was in my subject; one or two persons asked me afterward what was the matter with my hands.", "3": "It was now that the idea of pictures occurred to me; then my troubles passed away. In two minutes I made six pictures with a pen, and they did the work of the eleven catch-sentences, and did it perfectly. I threw the pictures away as soon as they were made, for I was sure I could shut my eyes and see them any time. That was a quarter of a century ago; the lecture vanished out of my head more than twenty years ago, but I could rewrite it from the pictures\u2014for they remain. Here are three of them: (Fig. 1).", "4": "The first one is a haystack\u2014below it a rattlesnake\u2014and it told me where to begin to talk ranch-life in Carson Valley. The second one told me where to begin to talk about a strange and violent wind that used to burst upon Carson City from the Sierra Nevadas every afternoon at two o'clock and try to blow the town away. The third picture, as you easily perceive, is lightning; its duty was to remind me when it was time to begin to talk about San Francisco weather, where there IS no lightning\u2014nor thunder, either\u2014and it never failed me.", "5": "I will give you a valuable hint. When a man is making a speech and you are to follow him don't jot down notes to speak from, jot down PICTURES. It is awkward and embarrassing to have to keep referring to notes; and besides it breaks up your speech and makes it ragged and non-coherent; but you can tear up your pictures as soon as you have made them\u2014they will stay fresh and strong in your memory in the order and sequence in which you scratched them down. And many will admire to see what a good memory you are furnished with, when perhaps your memory is not any better than mine.", "6": "Sixteen years ago when my children were little creatures the governess was trying to hammer some primer histories into their heads. Part of this fun--if you like to call it that--consisted in the memorizing of the accession dates of the thirty-seven personages who had ruled over England from the Conqueror down. These little people found it a bitter, hard contract. It was all dates, they all looked alike, and they wouldn't stick. Day after day of the summer vacation dribbled by, and still the kings held the fort; the children couldn't conquer any six of them.", "7": "With my lecture experience in mind I was aware that I could invent some way out of the trouble with pictures, but I hoped a way could be found which would let them romp in the open air while they learned the kings. I found it, and then they mastered all the monarchs in a day or two.", "8": "The idea was to make them see the reigns with their eyes; that would be a large help. We were at the farm then. From the house-porch the grounds sloped gradually down to the lower fence and rose on the right to the high ground where my small work-den stood. A carriage-road wound through the grounds and up the hill. I staked it out with the English monarchs, beginning with the Conqueror, and you could stand on the porch and clearly see every reign and its length, from the Conquest down to Victoria, then in the forty-sixth year of her reign\u2014eight hundred and seventeen years of English history under your eye at once!", "9": "English history was an unusually live topic in America just then. The world had suddenly realized that while it was not noticing the Queen had passed Henry VIII., passed Henry VI. and Elizabeth, and gaining in length every day. Her reign had entered the list of the long ones; everybody was interested now\u2014it was watching a race. Would she pass the long Edward? There was a possibility of it. Would she pass the long Henry? Doubtful, most people said. The long George? Impossible! Everybody said it. But we have lived to see her leave him two years behind.", "10": "I measured off 817 feet of the roadway, a foot representing a year, and at the beginning and end of each reign I drove a three-foot white-pine stake in the turf by the roadside and wrote the name and dates on it. Abreast the middle of the porch-front stood a great granite flower-vase overflowing with a cataract of bright-yellow flowers\u2014I can't think of their name. The vase was William the Conqueror. We put his name on it and his accession date, 1066. We started from that and measured off twenty-one feet of the road, and drove William Rufus's stake; then thirteen feet and drove the first Henry's stake; then thirty-five feet and drove Stephen's; then nineteen feet, which brought us just past the summer-house on the left; then we staked out thirty-five, ten, and seventeen for the second Henry and Richard and John; turned the curve and entered upon just what was needed for Henry III.\u2014a level, straight stretch of fifty-six feet of road without a crinkle in it. And it lay exactly in front of the house, in the middle of the grounds. There couldn't have been a better place for that long reign; you could stand on the porch and see those two wide-apart stakes almost with your eyes shut. (Fig. 2.)", "11": "That isn't the shape of the road\u2014I have bunched it up like that to save room. The road had some great curves in it, but their gradual sweep was such that they were no mar to history. No, in our road one could tell at a glance who was who by the size of the vacancy between stakes\u2014with locality to help, of course.", "12": "Although I am away off here in a Swedish village (1) and those stakes did not stand till the snow came, I can see them today as plainly as ever; and whenever I think of an English monarch his stakes rise before me of their own accord and I notice the large or small space which he takes up on our road. Are your kings spaced off in your mind? When you think of Richard III. and of James II. do the durations of their reigns seem about alike to you? It isn't so to me; I always notice that there's a foot's difference. When you think of Henry III. do you see a great long stretch of straight road? I do; and just at the end where it joins on to Edward I. I always see a small pear-bush with its green fruit hanging down. When I think of the Commonwealth I see a shady little group of these small saplings which we called the oak parlor; when I think of George III. I see him stretching up the hill, part of him occupied by a flight of stone steps; and I can locate Stephen to an inch when he comes into my mind, for he just filled the stretch which went by the summer-house. Victoria's reign reached almost to my study door on the first little summit; there's sixteen feet to be added now; I believe that that would carry it to a big pine-tree that was shattered by some lightning one summer when it was trying to hit me.", "13": "We got a good deal of fun out of the history road; and exercise, too. We trotted the course from the conqueror to the study, the children calling out the names, dates, and length of reigns as we passed the stakes, going a good gait along the long reigns, but slowing down when we came upon people like Mary and Edward VI., and the short Stuart and Plantagenet, to give time to get in the statistics. I offered prizes, too\u2014apples. I threw one as far as I could send it, and the child that first shouted the reign it fell in got the apple.", "14": "The children were encouraged to stop locating things as being \u201cover by the arbor,\u201d or \u201cin the oak parlor,\u201d or \u201cup at the stone steps,\u201d and say instead that the things were in Stephen, or in the Commonwealth, or in George III. They got the habit without trouble. To have the long road mapped out with such exactness was a great boon for me, for I had the habit of leaving books and other articles lying around everywhere, and had not previously been able to definitely name the place, and so had often been obliged to go to fetch them myself, to save time and failure; but now I could name the reign I left them in, and send the children.", "15": "Next I thought I would measure off the French reigns, and peg them alongside the English ones, so that we could always have contemporaneous French history under our eyes as we went our English rounds. We pegged them down to the Hundred Years' War, then threw the idea aside, I do not now remember why. After that we made the English pegs fence in European and American history as well as English, and that answered very well. English and alien poets, statesmen, artists, heroes, battles, plagues, cataclysms, revolutions\u2014we shoveled them all into the English fences according to their dates. Do you understand? We gave Washington's birth to George II.'s pegs and his death to George III.'s; George II. got the Lisbon earthquake and George III. the Declaration of Independence. Goethe, Shakespeare, Napoleon, Savonarola, Joan of Arc, the French Revolution, the Edict of Nantes, Clive, Wellington, Waterloo, Plassey, Patay, Cowpens, Saratoga, the Battle of the Boyne, the invention of the logarithms, the microscope, the steam-engine, the telegraph\u2014anything and everything all over the world\u2014we dumped it all in among the English pegs according to its date and regardless of its nationality.", "16": "If the road-pegging scheme had not succeeded I should have lodged the kings in the children's heads by means of pictures\u2014that is, I should have tried. It might have failed, for the pictures could only be effective when made by the pupil; not the master, for it is the work put upon the drawing that makes the drawing stay in the memory, and my children were too little to make drawings at that time. And, besides, they had no talent for art, which is strange, for in other ways they are like me.", "17": "But I will develop the picture plan now, hoping that you will be able to use it. It will come good for indoors when the weather is bad and one cannot go outside and peg a road. Let us imagine that the kings are a procession, and that they have come out of the Ark and down Ararat for exercise and are now starting back again up the zigzag road. This will bring several of them into view at once, and each zigzag will represent the length of a king's reign.", "18": "And so on. You will have plenty of space, for by my project you will use the parlor wall. You do not mark on the wall; that would cause trouble. You only attach bits of paper to it with pins or thumb-tacks. These will leave no mark.", "19": "Take your pen now, and twenty-one pieces of white paper, each two inches square, and we will do the twenty-one years of the Conqueror's reign. On each square draw a picture of a whale and write the dates and term of service. We choose the whale for several reasons: its name and William's begin with the same letter; it is the biggest fish that swims, and William is the most conspicuous figure in English history in the way of a landmark; finally, a whale is about the easiest thing to draw. By the time you have drawn twenty-one wales and written \u201cWilliam I.\u20141066-1087\u2014twenty-one years\u201d twenty-one times, those details will be your property; you cannot dislodge them from your memory with anything but dynamite. I will make a sample for you to copy: (Fig. 3).", "20": "I have got his chin up too high, but that is no matter; he is looking for Harold. It may be that a whale hasn't that fin up there on his back, but I do not remember; and so, since there is a doubt, it is best to err on the safe side. He looks better, anyway, than he would without it.", "21": "Be very careful and attentive while you are drawing your first whale from my sample and writing the word and figures under it, so that you will not need to copy the sample any more. Compare your copy with the sample; examine closely; if you find you have got everything right and can shut your eyes and see the picture and call the words and figures, then turn the sample and copy upside down and make the next copy from memory; and also the next and next, and so on, always drawing and writing from memory until you have finished the whole twenty-one. This will take you twenty minutes, or thirty, and by that time you will find that you can make a whale in less time than an unpracticed person can make a sardine; also, up to the time you die you will always be able to furnish William's dates to any ignorant person that inquires after them.", "22": "You will now take thirteen pieces of BLUE paper, each two inches square, and do William II. (Fig. 4.)", "23": "Make him spout his water forward instead of backward; also make him small, and stick a harpoon in him and give him that sick look in the eye. Otherwise you might seem to be continuing the other William, and that would be confusing and a damage. It is quite right to make him small; he was only about a No. 11 whale, or along there somewhere; there wasn't room in him for his father's great spirit. The barb of that harpoon ought not to show like that, because it is down inside the whale and ought to be out of sight, but it cannot be helped; if the barb were removed people would think some one had stuck a whip-stock into the whale. It is best to leave the barb the way it is, then every one will know it is a harpoon and attending to business. Remember\u2014draw from the copy only once; make your other twelve and the inscription from memory.", "24": "Now the truth is that whenever you have copied a picture and its inscription once from my sample and two or three times from memory the details will stay with you and be hard to forget. After that, if you like, you may make merely the whale's head and water-spout for the Conqueror till you end his reign, each time saying the inscription in place of writing it; and in the case of William II. make the harpoon alone, and say over the inscription each time you do it. You see, it will take nearly twice as long to do the first set as it will to do the second, and that will give you a marked sense of the difference in length of the two reigns.", "25": "Next do Henry I. on thirty-five squares of red paper. (Fig. 5.)", "26": "That is a hen, and suggests Henry by furnishing the first syllable. When you have repeated the hen and the inscription until you are perfectly sure of them, draw merely the hen's head the rest of the thirty-five times, saying over the inscription each time. Thus: (Fig. 6).", "27": "You begin to understand now how this procession is going to look when it is on the wall. First there will be the Conqueror's twenty-one whales and water-spouts, the twenty-one white squares joined to one another and making a white stripe three and one-half feet long; the thirteen blue squares of William II. will be joined to that\u2014a blue stripe two feet, two inches long, followed by Henry's red stripe five feet, ten inches long, and so on. The colored divisions will smartly show to the eye the difference in the length of the reigns and impress the proportions on the memory and the understanding. (Fig. 7.)", "28": "Stephen of Blois comes next. He requires nineteen two-inch squares of yellow paper. (Fig. 8.)", "29": "That is a steer. The sound suggests the beginning of Stephen's name. I choose it for that reason. I can make a better steer than that when I am not excited. But this one will do. It is a good-enough steer for history. The tail is defective, but it only wants straightening out.", "30": "Next comes Henry II. Give him thirty-five squares of red paper. These hens must face west, like the former ones. (Fig. 9.)", "31": "This hen differs from the other one. He is on his way to inquire what has been happening in Canterbury.", "32": "Now we arrive at Richard I., called Richard of the Lion-heart because he was a brave fighter and was never so contented as when he was leading crusades in Palestine and neglecting his affairs at home. Give him ten squares of white paper. (Fig. 10).", "33": "That is a lion. His office is to remind you of the lion-hearted Richard. There is something the matter with his legs, but I do not quite know what it is, they do not seem right. I think the hind ones are the most unsatisfactory; the front ones are well enough, though it would be better if they were rights and lefts.", "34": "Next comes King John, and he was a poor circumstance. He was called Lackland. He gave his realm to the Pope. Let him have seventeen squares of yellow paper. (Fig. 11.)", "35": "That creature is a jamboree. It looks like a trademark, but that is only an accident and not intentional. It is prehistoric and extinct. It used to roam the earth in the Old Silurian times, and lay eggs and catch fish and climb trees and live on fossils; for it was of a mixed breed, which was the fashion then. It was very fierce, and the Old Silurians were afraid of it, but this is a tame one. Physically it has no representative now, but its mind has been transmitted. First I drew it sitting down, but have turned it the other way now because I think it looks more attractive and spirited when one end of it is galloping. I love to think that in this attitude it gives us a pleasant idea of John coming all in a happy excitement to see what the barons have been arranging for him at Runnymede, while the other one gives us an idea of him sitting down to wring his hands and grieve over it.", "36": "We now come to Henry III.; red squares again, of course\u2014fifty-six of them. We must make all the Henrys the same color; it will make their long reigns show up handsomely on the wall. Among all the eight Henrys there were but two short ones. A lucky name, as far as longevity goes. The reigns of six of the Henrys cover 227 years. It might have been well to name all the royal princes Henry, but this was overlooked until it was too late. (Fig. 12.)", "37": "This is the best one yet. He is on his way (1265) to have a look at the first House of Commons in English history. It was a monumental event, the situation of the House, and was the second great liberty landmark which the century had set up. I have made Henry looking glad, but this was not intentional.", "38": "Edward I. comes next; light-brown paper, thirty-five squares. (Fig. 13.)", "39": "That is an editor. He is trying to think of a word. He props his feet on the chair, which is the editor's way; then he can think better. I do not care much for this one; his ears are not alike; still, editor suggests the sound of Edward, and he will do. I could make him better if I had a model, but I made this one from memory. But it is no particular matter; they all look alike, anyway. They are conceited and troublesome, and don't pay enough. Edward was the first really English king that had yet occupied the throne. The editor in the picture probably looks just as Edward looked when it was first borne in upon him that this was so. His whole attitude expressed gratification and pride mixed with stupefaction and astonishment.", "40": "Edward II. now; twenty blue squares. (Fig. 14.)", "41": "Another editor. That thing behind his ear is his pencil. Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that. That does him good, and makes him smile and show his teeth, the way he is doing in the picture. This one has just been striking out a smart thing, and now he is sitting there with his thumbs in his vest-holes, gloating. They are full of envy and malice, editors are. This picture will serve to remind you that Edward II. was the first English king who was deposed. Upon demand, he signed his deposition himself. He had found kingship a most aggravating and disagreeable occupation, and you can see by the look of him that he is glad he resigned. He has put his blue pencil up for good now. He had struck out many a good thing with it in his time.", "42": "Edward III. next; fifty red squares. (Fig. 15.)", "43": "This editor is a critic. He has pulled out his carving-knife and his tomahawk and is starting after a book which he is going to have for breakfast. This one's arms are put on wrong. I did not notice it at first, but I see it now. Somehow he has got his right arm on his left shoulder, and his left arm on the right shoulder, and this shows us the back of his hands in both instances. It makes him left-handed all around, which is a thing which has never happened before, except perhaps in a museum. That is the way with art, when it is not acquired but born to you: you start in to make some simple little thing, not suspecting that your genius is beginning to work and swell and strain in secret, and all of a sudden there is a convulsion and you fetch out something astonishing. This is called inspiration. It is an accident; you never know when it is coming. I might have tried as much as a year to think of such a strange thing as an all-around left-handed man and I could not have done it, for the more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the more it eludes you; but it can't elude inspiration; you have only to bait with inspiration and you will get it every time. Look at Botticelli's \u201cSpring.\u201d Those snaky women were unthinkable, but inspiration secured them for us, thanks to goodness. It is too late to reorganize this editor-critic now; we will leave him as he is. He will serve to remind us.", "44": "Richard II. next; twenty-two white squares. (Fig. 16.)", "45": "We use the lion again because this is another Richard. Like Edward II., he was deposed. He is taking a last sad look at his crown before they take it away. There was not room enough and I have made it too small; but it never fitted him, anyway.", "46": "Now we turn the corner of the century with a new line of monarchs\u2014the Lancastrian kings.", "47": "Henry IV.; fourteen squares of yellow paper. (Fig. 17.)", "48": "This hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes the imposing magnitude of the event. She is giving notice in the usual way. You notice I am improving in the construction of hens. At first I made them too much like other animals, but this one is orthodox. I mention this to encourage you. You will find that the more you practice the more accurate you will become. I could always draw animals, but before I was educated I could not tell what kind they were when I got them done, but now I can. Keep up your courage; it will be the same with you, although you may not think it. This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was born.", "49": "Henry V.; nine blue squares. (Fig. 18)", "50": "There you see him lost in meditation over the monument which records the amazing figures of the battle of Agincourt. French history says 20,000 Englishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there; and English historians say that the French loss, in killed and wounded, was 60,000.", "51": "Henry VI.; thirty-nine red squares. (Fig. 19)", "52": "This is poor Henry VI., who reigned long and scored many misfortunes and humiliations. Also two great disasters: he lost France to Joan of Arc and he lost the throne and ended the dynasty which Henry IV. had started in business with such good prospects. In the picture we see him sad and weary and downcast, with the scepter falling from his nerveless grasp. It is a pathetic quenching of a sun which had risen in such splendor.", "53": "Edward IV.; twenty-two light-brown squares. (Fig. 20.)", "54": "That is a society editor, sitting there elegantly dressed, with his legs crossed in that indolent way, observing the clothes the ladies wear, so that he can describe them for his paper and make them out finer than they are and get bribes for it and become wealthy. That flower which he is wearing in his buttonhole is a rose\u2014a white rose, a York rose\u2014and will serve to remind us of the War of the Roses, and that the white one was the winning color when Edward got the throne and dispossessed the Lancastrian dynasty.", "55": "Edward V.; one-third of a black square. (Fig. 21.)", "56": "His uncle Richard had him murdered in the tower. When you get the reigns displayed upon the wall this one will be conspicuous and easily remembered. It is the shortest one in English history except Lady Jane Grey's, which was only nine days. She is never officially recognized as a monarch of England, but if you or I should ever occupy a throne we should like to have proper notice taken of it; and it would be only fair and right, too, particularly if we gained nothing by it and lost our lives besides.", "57": "Richard III.; two white squares. (Fig. 22.)", "58": "That is not a very good lion, but Richard was not a very good king. You would think that this lion has two heads, but that is not so; one is only a shadow. There would be shadows for the rest of him, but there was not light enough to go round, it being a dull day, with only fleeting sun-glimpses now and then. Richard had a humped back and a hard heart, and fell at the battle of Bosworth. I do not know the name of that flower in the pot, but we will use it as Richard's trade-mark, for it is said that it grows in only one place in the world\u2014Bosworth Field\u2014and tradition says it never grew there until Richard's royal blood warmed its hidden seed to life and made it grow.", "59": "Henry VII.; twenty-four blue squares. (Fig. 23.)", "60": "Henry VII. had no liking for wars and turbulence; he preferred peace and quiet and the general prosperity which such conditions create. He liked to sit on that kind of eggs on his own private account as well as the nation's, and hatch them out and count up the result. When he died he left his heir 2,000,000 pounds, which was a most unusual fortune for a king to possess in those days. Columbus's great achievement gave him the discovery-fever, and he sent Sebastian Cabot to the New World to search out some foreign territory for England. That is Cabot's ship up there in the corner. This was the first time that England went far abroad to enlarge her estate\u2014but not the last.", "61": "Henry VIII.; thirty-eight red squares. (Fig. 24.)", "62": "That is Henry VIII. suppressing a monastery in his arrogant fashion.", "63": "Edward VI.; six squares of yellow paper. (Fig. 25.)", "64": "He is the last Edward to date. It is indicated by that thing over his head, which is a last\u2014shoemaker's last.", "65": "Mary; five squares of black paper. (Fig. 26.)", "66": "The picture represents a burning martyr. He is in back of the smoke. The first three letters of Mary's name and the first three of the word martyr are the same. Martyrdom was going out in her day and martyrs were becoming scarcer, but she made several. For this reason she is sometimes called Bloody Mary.", "67": "This brings us to the reign of Elizabeth, after passing through a period of nearly five hundred years of England's history\u2014492 to be exact. I think you may now be trusted to go the rest of the way without further lessons in art or inspirations in the matter of ideas. You have the scheme now, and something in the ruler's name or career will suggest the pictorial symbol. The effort of inventing such things will not only help your memory, but will develop originality in art. See what it has done for me. If you do not find the parlor wall big enough for all of England's history, continue it into the dining-room and into other rooms. This will make the walls interesting and instructive and really worth something instead of being just flat things to hold the house together."}, "THE MEMORABLE ASSASSINATION": {"0": "Note.\u2014The assassination of the Empress of Austria at Geneva, September 10, 1898, occurred during Mark Twain's Austrian residence. The news came to him at Kaltenleutgeben, a summer resort a little way out of Vienna. To his friend, the Rev. Jos. H. Twichell, he wrote:", "1": "\u201cThat good and unoffending lady, the Empress, is killed by a madman, and I am living in the midst of world-history again. The Queen's Jubilee last year, the invasion of the Reichsrath by the police, and now this murder, which will still be talked of and described and painted a thousand years from now. To have a personal friend of the wearer of two crowns burst in at the gate in the deep dusk of the evening and say, in a voice broken with tears, 'My God! the Empress is murdered,' and fly toward her home before we can utter a question\u2014why, it brings the giant event home to you, makes you a part of it and personally interested; it is as if your neighbor, Antony, should come flying and say, 'Caesar is butchered\u2014the head of the world is fallen!'", "2": "\u201cOf course there is no talk but of this. The mourning is universal and genuine, the consternation is stupefying. The Austrian Empire is being draped with black. Vienna will be a spectacle to see by next Saturday, when the funeral cortege marches.\u201d", "3": "He was strongly moved by the tragedy, impelled to write concerning it. He prepared the article which here follows, but did not offer it for publication, perhaps feeling that his own close association with the court circles at the moment prohibited this personal utterance. There appears no such reason for withholding its publication now.", "4": "A. B. P.", "5": "The more one thinks of the assassination, the more imposing and tremendous the event becomes. The destruction of a city is a large event, but it is one which repeats itself several times in a thousand years; the destruction of a third part of a nation by plague and famine is a large event, but it has happened several times in history; the murder of a king is a large event, but it has been frequent.", "6": "The murder of an empress is the largest of all large events. One must go back about two thousand years to find an instance to put with this one. The oldest family of unchallenged descent in Christendom lives in Rome and traces its line back seventeen hundred years, but no member of it has been present in the earth when an empress was murdered, until now. Many a time during these seventeen centuries members of that family have been startled with the news of extraordinary events\u2014the destruction of cities, the fall of thrones, the murder of kings, the wreck of dynasties, the extinction of religions, the birth of new systems of government; and their descendants have been by to hear of it and talk about it when all these things were repeated once, twice, or a dozen times\u2014but to even that family has come news at last which is not staled by use, has no duplicates in the long reach of its memory.", "7": "It is an event which confers a curious distinction upon every individual now living in the world: he has stood alive and breathing in the presence of an event such as has not fallen within the experience of any traceable or untraceable ancestor of his for twenty centuries, and it is not likely to fall within the experience of any descendant of his for twenty more.", "8": "Time has made some great changes since the Roman days. The murder of an empress then\u2014even the assassination of Caesar himself\u2014could not electrify the world as this murder has electrified it. For one reason, there was then not much of a world to electrify; it was a small world, as to known bulk, and it had rather a thin population, besides; and for another reason, the news traveled so slowly that its tremendous initial thrill wasted away, week by week and month by month, on the journey, and by the time it reached the remoter regions there was but little of it left. It was no longer a fresh event, it was a thing of the far past; it was not properly news, it was history. But the world is enormous now, and prodigiously populated\u2014that is one change; and another is the lightning swiftness of the flight of tidings, good and bad. \u201cThe Empress is murdered!\u201d When those amazing words struck upon my ear in this Austrian village last Saturday, three hours after the disaster, I knew that it was already old news in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, Japan, China, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, and that the entire globe with a single voice, was cursing the perpetrator of it. Since the telegraph first began to stretch itself wider and wider about the earth, larger and increasingly larger areas of the world have, as time went on, received simultaneously the shock of a great calamity; but this is the first time in history that the entire surface of the globe has been swept in a single instant with the thrill of so gigantic an event.", "9": "And who is the miracle-worker who has furnished to the world this spectacle? All the ironies are compacted in the answer. He is at the bottom of the human ladder, as the accepted estimates of degree and value go: a soiled and patched young loafer, without gifts, without talents, without education, without morals, without character, without any born charm or any acquired one that wins or beguiles or attracts; without a single grace of mind or heart or hand that any tramp or prostitute could envy him; an unfaithful private in the ranks, an incompetent stone-cutter, an inefficient lackey; in a word, a mangy, offensive, empty, unwashed, vulgar, gross, mephitic, timid, sneaking, human polecat. And it was within the privileges and powers of this sarcasm upon the human race to reach up\u2014up\u2014up\u2014and strike from its far summit in the social skies the world's accepted ideal of Glory and Might and Splendor and Sacredness! It realizes to us what sorry shows and shadows we are. Without our clothes and our pedestals we are poor things and much of a size; our dignities are not real, our pomps are shams. At our best and stateliest we are not suns, as we pretended, and teach, and believe, but only candles; and any bummer can blow us out.", "10": "And now we get realized to us once more another thing which we often forget\u2014or try to: that no man has a wholly undiseased mind; that in one way or another all men are mad. Many are mad for money. When this madness is in a mild form it is harmless and the man passes for sane; but when it develops powerfully and takes possession of the man, it can make him cheat, rob, and kill; and when he has got his fortune and lost it again it can land him in the asylum or the suicide's coffin. Love is a madness; if thwarted it develops fast; it can grow to a frenzy of despair and make an otherwise sane and highly gifted prince, like Rudolph, throw away the crown of an empire and snuff out his own life. All the whole list of desires, predilections, aversions, ambitions, passions, cares, griefs, regrets, remorses, are incipient madness, and ready to grow, spread, and consume, when the occasion comes. There are no healthy minds, and nothing saves any man but accident\u2014the accident of not having his malady put to the supreme test.", "11": "One of the commonest forms of madness is the desire to be noticed, the pleasure derived from being noticed. Perhaps it is not merely common, but universal. In its mildest form it doubtless is universal. Every child is pleased at being noticed; many intolerable children put in their whole time in distressing and idiotic effort to attract the attention of visitors; boys are always \u201cshowing off\u201d; apparently all men and women are glad and grateful when they find that they have done a thing which has lifted them for a moment out of obscurity and caused wondering talk. This common madness can develop, by nurture, into a hunger for notoriety in one, for fame in another. It is this madness for being noticed and talked about which has invented kingship and the thousand other dignities, and tricked them out with pretty and showy fineries; it has made kings pick one another's pockets, scramble for one another's crowns and estates, slaughter one another's subjects; it has raised up prize-fighters, and poets, and village mayors, and little and big politicians, and big and little charity-founders, and bicycle champions, and banditti chiefs, and frontier desperadoes, and Napoleons. Anything to get notoriety; anything to set the village, or the township, or the city, or the State, or the nation, or the planet shouting, \u201cLook\u2014there he goes\u2014that is the man!\u201d And in five minutes' time, at no cost of brain, or labor, or genius this mangy Italian tramp has beaten them all, transcended them all, outstripped them all, for in time their names will perish; but by the friendly help of the insane newspapers and courts and kings and historians, his is safe to live and thunder in the world all down the ages as long as human speech shall endure! Oh, if it were not so tragic how ludicrous it would be!", "12": "She was so blameless, the Empress; and so beautiful, in mind and heart, in person and spirit; and whether with a crown upon her head or without it and nameless, a grace to the human race, and almost a justification of its creation; would be, indeed, but that the animal that struck her down re-establishes the doubt.", "13": "In her character was every quality that in woman invites and engages respect, esteem, affection, and homage. Her tastes, her instincts, and her aspirations were all high and fine and all her life her heart and brain were busy with activities of a noble sort. She had had bitter griefs, but they did not sour her spirit, and she had had the highest honors in the world's gift, but she went her simple way unspoiled. She knew all ranks, and won them all, and made them her friends. An English fisherman's wife said, \u201cWhen a body was in trouble she didn't send her help, she brought it herself.\u201d Crowns have adorned others, but she adorned her crowns.", "14": "It was a swift celebrity the assassin achieved. And it is marked by some curious contrasts. At noon last Saturday there was no one in the world who would have considered acquaintanceship with him a thing worth claiming or mentioning; no one would have been vain of such an acquaintanceship; the humblest honest boot-black would not have valued the fact that he had met him or seen him at some time or other; he was sunk in abysmal obscurity, he was away beneath the notice of the bottom grades of officialdom. Three hours later he was the one subject of conversation in the world, the gilded generals and admirals and governors were discussing him, all the kings and queens and emperors had put aside their other interests to talk about him. And wherever there was a man, at the summit of the world or the bottom of it, who by chance had at some time or other come across that creature, he remembered it with a secret satisfaction, and mentioned it\u2014for it was a distinction, now! It brings human dignity pretty low, and for a moment the thing is not quite realizable\u2014but it is perfectly true. If there is a king who can remember, now, that he once saw that creature in a time past, he has let that fact out, in a more or less studiedly casual and indifferent way, some dozens of times during the past week. For a king is merely human; the inside of him is exactly like the inside of any other person; and it is human to find satisfaction in being in a kind of personal way connected with amazing events. We are all privately vain of such a thing; we are all alike; a king is a king by accident; the reason the rest of us are not kings is merely due to another accident; we are all made out of the same clay, and it is a sufficiently poor quality.", "15": "Below the kings, these remarks are in the air these days; I know it as well as if I were hearing them:", "16": "THE COMMANDER: \u201cHe was in my army.\u201d", "17": "THE GENERAL: \u201cHe was in my corps.\u201d", "18": "THE COLONEL: \u201cHe was in my regiment. A brute. I remember him well.\u201d", "19": "THE CAPTAIN: \u201cHe was in my company. A troublesome scoundrel. I remember him well.\u201d", "20": "THE SERGEANT: \u201cDid I know him? As well as I know you. Why, every morning I used to\u2014\u201d etc., etc.; a glad, long story, told to devouring ears.", "21": "THE LANDLADY: \u201cMany's the time he boarded with me. I can show you his very room, and the very bed he slept in. And the charcoal mark there on the wall\u2014he made that. My little Johnny saw him do it with his own eyes. Didn't you, Johnny?\u201d", "22": "It is easy to see, by the papers, that the magistrate and the constables and the jailer treasure up the assassin's daily remarks and doings as precious things, and as wallowing this week in seas of blissful distinction. The interviewer, too; he tries to let on that he is not vain of his privilege of contact with this man whom few others are allowed to gaze upon, but he is human, like the rest, and can no more keep his vanity corked in than could you or I.", "23": "Some think that this murder is a frenzied revolt against the criminal militarism which is impoverishing Europe and driving the starving poor mad. That has many crimes to answer for, but not this one, I think. One may not attribute to this man a generous indignation against the wrongs done the poor; one may not dignify him with a generous impulse of any kind. When he saw his photograph and said, \u201cI shall be celebrated,\u201d he laid bare the impulse that prompted him. It was a mere hunger for notoriety. There is another confessed case of the kind which is as old as history\u2014the burning of the temple of Ephesus.", "24": "Among the inadequate attempts to account for the assassination we must concede high rank to the many which have described it as a \u201cpeculiarly brutal crime\u201d and then added that it was \u201cordained from above.\u201d I think this verdict will not be popular \u201cabove.\u201d If the deed was ordained from above, there is no rational way of making this prisoner even partially responsible for it, and the Genevan court cannot condemn him without manifestly committing a crime. Logic is logic, and by disregarding its laws even the most pious and showy theologian may be beguiled into preferring charges which should not be ventured upon except in the shelter of plenty of lightning-rods.", "25": "I witnessed the funeral procession, in company with friends, from the windows of the Krantz, Vienna's sumptuous new hotel. We came into town in the middle of the forenoon, and I went on foot from the station. Black flags hung down from all the houses; the aspects were Sunday-like; the crowds on the sidewalks were quiet and moved slowly; very few people were smoking; many ladies wore deep mourning, gentlemen were in black as a rule; carriages were speeding in all directions, with footmen and coachmen in black clothes and wearing black cocked hats; the shops were closed; in many windows were pictures of the Empress: as a beautiful young bride of seventeen; as a serene and majestic lady with added years; and finally in deep black and without ornaments\u2014the costume she always wore after the tragic death of her son nine years ago, for her heart broke then, and life lost almost all its value for her. The people stood grouped before these pictures, and now and then one saw women and girls turn away wiping the tears from their eyes.", "26": "In front of the Krantz is an open square; over the way was the church where the funeral services would be held. It is small and old and severely plain, plastered outside and whitewashed or painted, and with no ornament but a statue of a monk in a niche over the door, and above that a small black flag. But in its crypt lie several of the great dead of the House of Habsburg, among them Maria Theresa and Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt. Hereabouts was a Roman camp, once, and in it the Emperor Marcus Aurelius died a thousand years before the first Habsburg ruled in Vienna, which was six hundred years ago and more.", "27": "The little church is packed in among great modern stores and houses, and the windows of them were full of people. Behind the vast plate-glass windows of the upper floors of a house on the corner one glimpsed terraced masses of fine-clothed men and women, dim and shimmery, like people under water. Under us the square was noiseless, but it was full of citizens; officials in fine uniforms were flitting about on errands, and in a doorstep sat a figure in the uttermost raggedness of poverty, the feet bare, the head bent humbly down; a youth of eighteen or twenty, he was, and through the field-glass one could see that he was tearing apart and munching riffraff that he had gathered somewhere. Blazing uniforms flashed by him, making a sparkling contrast with his drooping ruin of moldy rags, but he took no notice; he was not there to grieve for a nation's disaster; he had his own cares, and deeper. From two directions two long files of infantry came plowing through the pack and press in silence; there was a low, crisp order and the crowd vanished, the square save the sidewalks was empty, the private mourner was gone. Another order, the soldiers fell apart and enclosed the square in a double-ranked human fence. It was all so swift, noiseless, exact\u2014like a beautifully ordered machine.", "28": "It was noon, now. Two hours of stillness and waiting followed. Then carriages began to flow past and deliver the two or three hundred court personages and high nobilities privileged to enter the church. Then the square filled up; not with civilians, but with army and navy officers in showy and beautiful uniforms. They filled it compactly, leaving only a narrow carriage path in front of the church, but there was no civilian among them. And it was better so; dull clothes would have marred the radiant spectacle. In the jam in front of the church, on its steps, and on the sidewalk was a bunch of uniforms which made a blazing splotch of color\u2014intense red, gold, and white\u2014which dimmed the brilliancies around them; and opposite them on the other side of the path was a bunch of cascaded bright-green plumes above pale-blue shoulders which made another splotch of splendor emphatic and conspicuous in its glowing surroundings. It was a sea of flashing color all about, but these two groups were the high notes. The green plumes were worn by forty or fifty Austrian generals, the group opposite them were chiefly Knights of Malta and knights of a German order. The mass of heads in the square were covered by gilt helmets and by military caps roofed with a mirror-like glaze, and the movements of the wearers caused these things to catch the sun-rays, and the effect was fine to see\u2014the square was like a garden of richly colored flowers with a multitude of blinding and flashing little suns distributed over it.", "29": "Think of it\u2014it was by command of that Italian loafer yonder on his imperial throne in the Geneva prison that this splendid multitude was assembled there; and the kings and emperors that were entering the church from a side street were there by his will. It is so strange, so unrealizable.", "30": "At three o'clock the carriages were still streaming by in single file. At three-five a cardinal arrives with his attendants; later some bishops; then a number of archdeacons\u2014all in striking colors that add to the show. At three-ten a procession of priests passes along, with crucifix. Another one, presently; after an interval, two more; at three-fifty another one\u2014very long, with many crosses, gold-embroidered robes, and much white lace; also great pictured banners, at intervals, receding into the distance.", "31": "A hum of tolling bells makes itself heard, but not sharply. At three-fifty-eight a waiting interval. Presently a long procession of gentlemen in evening dress comes in sight and approaches until it is near to the square, then falls back against the wall of soldiers at the sidewalk, and the white shirt-fronts show like snowflakes and are very conspicuous where so much warm color is all about.", "32": "A waiting pause. At four-twelve the head of the funeral procession comes into view at last. First, a body of cavalry, four abreast, to widen the path. Next, a great body of lancers, in blue, with gilt helmets. Next, three six-horse mourning-coaches; outriders and coachmen in black, with cocked hats and white wigs. Next, troops in splendid uniforms, red, gold, and white, exceedingly showy.", "33": "Now the multitude uncover. The soldiers present arms; there is a low rumble of drums; the sumptuous great hearse approaches, drawn at a walk by eight black horses plumed with black bunches of nodding ostrich feathers; the coffin is borne into the church, the doors are closed.", "34": "The multitude cover their heads, and the rest of the procession moves by; first the Hungarian Guard in their indescribably brilliant and picturesque and beautiful uniform, inherited from the ages of barbaric splendor, and after them other mounted forces, a long and showy array.", "35": "Then the shining crown in the square crumbled apart, a wrecked rainbow, and melted away in radiant streams, and in the turn of a wrist the three dirtiest and raggedest and cheerfulest little slum-girls in Austria were capering about in the spacious vacancy. It was a day of contrasts.", "36": "Twice the Empress entered Vienna in state. The first time was in 1854, when she was a bride of seventeen, and then she rode in measureless pomp and with blare of music through a fluttering world of gay flags and decorations, down streets walled on both hands with a press of shouting and welcoming subjects; and the second time was last Wednesday, when she entered the city in her coffin and moved down the same streets in the dead of the night under swaying black flags, between packed human walls again; but everywhere was a deep stillness, now\u2014a stillness emphasized, rather than broken, by the muffled hoofbeats of the long cavalcade over pavements cushioned with sand, and the low sobbing of gray-headed women who had witnessed the first entry forty-four years before, when she and they were young\u2014and unaware!", "37": "A character in Baron von Berger's recent fairy drama \u201cHabsburg\u201d tells about that first coming of the girlish Empress-Queen, and in his history draws a fine picture: I cannot make a close translation of it, but will try to convey the spirit of the verses:"}, "A SCRAP OF CURIOUS HISTORY": {"0": "Marion City, on the Mississippi River, in the State of Missouri\u2014a village; time, 1845. La Bourboule-les-Bains, France\u2014a village; time, the end of June, 1894. I was in the one village in that early time; I am in the other now. These times and places are sufficiently wide apart, yet today I have the strange sense of being thrust back into that Missourian village and of reliving certain stirring days that I lived there so long ago.", "1": "Last Saturday night the life of the President of the French Republic was taken by an Italian assassin. Last night a mob surrounded our hotel, shouting, howling, singing the \u201cMarseillaise,\u201d and pelting our windows with sticks and stones; for we have Italian waiters, and the mob demanded that they be turned out of the house instantly\u2014to be drubbed, and then driven out of the village. Everybody in the hotel remained up until far into the night, and experienced the several kinds of terror which one reads about in books which tell of night attacks by Italians and by French mobs: the growing roar of the oncoming crowd; the arrival, with rain of stones and a crash of glass; the withdrawal to rearrange plans\u2014followed by a silence ominous, threatening, and harder to bear than even the active siege and the noise. The landlord and the two village policemen stood their ground, and at last the mob was persuaded to go away and leave our Italians in peace. Today four of the ringleaders have been sentenced to heavy punishment of a public sort\u2014and are become local heroes, by consequence.", "2": "That is the very mistake which was at first made in the Missourian village half a century ago. The mistake was repeated and repeated\u2014just as France is doing in these latter months.", "3": "In our village we had our Ravochals, our Henrys, our Vaillants; and in a humble way our Cesario\u2014I hope I have spelled this name wrong. Fifty years ago we passed through, in all essentials, what France has been passing through during the past two or three years, in the matter of periodical frights, horrors, and shudderings.", "4": "In several details the parallels are quaintly exact. In that day, for a man to speak out openly and proclaim himself an enemy of negro slavery was simply to proclaim himself a madman. For he was blaspheming against the holiest thing known to a Missourian, and could NOT be in his right mind. For a man to proclaim himself an anarchist in France, three years ago, was to proclaim himself a madman\u2014he could not be in his right mind.", "5": "Now the original old first blasphemer against any institution profoundly venerated by a community is quite sure to be in earnest; his followers and imitators may be humbugs and self-seekers, but he himself is sincere\u2014his heart is in his protest.", "6": "Robert Hardy was our first abolitionist\u2014awful name! He was a journeyman cooper, and worked in the big cooper-shop belonging to the great pork-packing establishment which was Marion City's chief pride and sole source of prosperity. He was a New-Englander, a stranger. And, being a stranger, he was of course regarded as an inferior person\u2014for that has been human nature from Adam down\u2014and of course, also, he was made to feel unwelcome, for this is the ancient law with man and the other animals. Hardy was thirty years old, and a bachelor; pale, given to reverie and reading. He was reserved, and seemed to prefer the isolation which had fallen to his lot. He was treated to many side remarks by his fellows, but as he did not resent them it was decided that he was a coward.", "7": "All of a sudden he proclaimed himself an abolitionist\u2014straight out and publicly! He said that negro slavery was a crime, an infamy. For a moment the town was paralyzed with astonishment; then it broke into a fury of rage and swarmed toward the cooper-shop to lynch Hardy. But the Methodist minister made a powerful speech to them and stayed their hands. He proved to them that Hardy was insane and not responsible for his words; that no man could be sane and utter such words.", "8": "So Hardy was saved. Being insane, he was allowed to go on talking. He was found to be good entertainment. Several nights running he made abolition speeches in the open air, and all the town flocked to hear and laugh. He implored them to believe him sane and sincere, and have pity on the poor slaves, and take measures for the restoration of their stolen rights, or in no long time blood would flow\u2014blood, blood, rivers of blood!", "9": "It was great fun. But all of a sudden the aspect of things changed. A slave came flying from Palmyra, the county-seat, a few miles back, and was about to escape in a canoe to Illinois and freedom in the dull twilight of the approaching dawn, when the town constable seized him. Hardy happened along and tried to rescue the negro; there was a struggle, and the constable did not come out of it alive. Hardy crossed the river with the negro, and then came back to give himself up. All this took time, for the Mississippi is not a French brook, like the Seine, the Loire, and those other rivulets, but is a real river nearly a mile wide. The town was on hand in force by now, but the Methodist preacher and the sheriff had already made arrangements in the interest of order; so Hardy was surrounded by a strong guard and safely conveyed to the village calaboose in spite of all the effort of the mob to get hold of him. The reader will have begun to perceive that this Methodist minister was a prompt man; a prompt man, with active hands and a good headpiece. Williams was his name\u2014Damon Williams; Damon Williams in public, Damnation Williams in private, because he was so powerful on that theme and so frequent.", "10": "The excitement was prodigious. The constable was the first man who had ever been killed in the town. The event was by long odds the most imposing in the town's history. It lifted the humble village into sudden importance; its name was in everybody's mouth for twenty miles around. And so was the name of Robert Hardy\u2014Robert Hardy, the stranger, the despised. In a day he was become the person of most consequence in the region, the only person talked about. As to those other coopers, they found their position curiously changed\u2014they were important people, or unimportant, now, in proportion as to how large or how small had been their intercourse with the new celebrity. The two or three who had really been on a sort of familiar footing with him found themselves objects of admiring interest with the public and of envy with their shopmates.", "11": "The village weekly journal had lately gone into new hands. The new man was an enterprising fellow, and he made the most of the tragedy. He issued an extra. Then he put up posters promising to devote his whole paper to matters connected with the great event\u2014there would be a full and intensely interesting biography of the murderer, and even a portrait of him. He was as good as his word. He carved the portrait himself, on the back of a wooden type\u2014and a terror it was to look at. It made a great commotion, for this was the first time the village paper had ever contained a picture. The village was very proud. The output of the paper was ten times as great as it had ever been before, yet every copy was sold.", "12": "When the trial came on, people came from all the farms around, and from Hannibal, and Quincy, and even from Keokuk; and the court-house could hold only a fraction of the crowd that applied for admission. The trial was published in the village paper, with fresh and still more trying pictures of the accused.", "13": "Hardy was convicted, and hanged\u2014a mistake. People came from miles around to see the hanging; they brought cakes and cider, also the women and children, and made a picnic of the matter. It was the largest crowd the village had ever seen. The rope that hanged Hardy was eagerly bought up, in inch samples, for everybody wanted a memento of the memorable event.", "14": "Martyrdom gilded with notoriety has its fascinations. Within one week afterward four young lightweights in the village proclaimed themselves abolitionists! In life Hardy had not been able to make a convert; everybody laughed at him; but nobody could laugh at his legacy. The four swaggered around with their slouch-hats pulled down over their faces, and hinted darkly at awful possibilities. The people were troubled and afraid, and showed it. And they were stunned, too; they could not understand it. \u201cAbolitionist\u201d had always been a term of shame and horror; yet here were four young men who were not only not ashamed to bear that name, but were grimly proud of it. Respectable young men they were, too\u2014of good families, and brought up in the church. Ed Smith, the printer's apprentice, nineteen, had been the head Sunday-school boy, and had once recited three thousand Bible verses without making a break. Dick Savage, twenty, the baker's apprentice; Will Joyce, twenty-two, journeyman blacksmith; and Henry Taylor, twenty-four, tobacco-stemmer\u2014were the other three. They were all of a sentimental cast; they were all romance-readers; they all wrote poetry, such as it was; they were all vain and foolish; but they had never before been suspected of having anything bad in them.", "15": "They withdrew from society, and grew more and more mysterious and dreadful. They presently achieved the distinction of being denounced by names from the pulpit\u2014which made an immense stir! This was grandeur, this was fame. They were envied by all the other young fellows now. This was natural. Their company grew\u2014grew alarmingly. They took a name. It was a secret name, and was divulged to no outsider; publicly they were simply the abolitionists. They had pass-words, grips, and signs; they had secret meetings; their initiations were conducted with gloomy pomps and ceremonies, at midnight.", "16": "They always spoke of Hardy as \u201cthe Martyr,\u201d and every little while they moved through the principal street in procession\u2014at midnight, black-robed, masked, to the measured tap of the solemn drum\u2014on pilgrimage to the Martyr's grave, where they went through with some majestic fooleries and swore vengeance upon his murderers. They gave previous notice of the pilgrimage by small posters, and warned everybody to keep indoors and darken all houses along the route, and leave the road empty. These warnings were obeyed, for there was a skull and crossbones at the top of the poster.", "17": "When this kind of thing had been going on about eight weeks, a quite natural thing happened. A few men of character and grit woke up out of the nightmare of fear which had been stupefying their faculties, and began to discharge scorn and scoffings at themselves and the community for enduring this child's-play; and at the same time they proposed to end it straightway. Everybody felt an uplift; life was breathed into their dead spirits; their courage rose and they began to feel like men again. This was on a Saturday. All day the new feeling grew and strengthened; it grew with a rush; it brought inspiration and cheer with it. Midnight saw a united community, full of zeal and pluck, and with a clearly defined and welcome piece of work in front of it. The best organizer and strongest and bitterest talker on that great Saturday was the Presbyterian clergyman who had denounced the original four from his pulpit\u2014Rev. Hiram Fletcher\u2014and he promised to use his pulpit in the public interest again now. On the morrow he had revelations to make, he said\u2014secrets of the dreadful society.", "18": "But the revelations were never made. At half past two in the morning the dead silence of the village was broken by a crashing explosion, and the town patrol saw the preacher's house spring in a wreck of whirling fragments into the sky. The preacher was killed, together with a negro woman, his only slave and servant.", "19": "The town was paralyzed again, and with reason. To struggle against a visible enemy is a thing worth while, and there is a plenty of men who stand always ready to undertake it; but to struggle against an invisible one\u2014an invisible one who sneaks in and does his awful work in the dark and leaves no trace\u2014that is another matter. That is a thing to make the bravest tremble and hold back.", "20": "The cowed populace were afraid to go to the funeral. The man who was to have had a packed church to hear him expose and denounce the common enemy had but a handful to see him buried. The coroner's jury had brought in a verdict of \u201cdeath by the visitation of God,\u201d for no witness came forward; if any existed they prudently kept out of the way. Nobody seemed sorry. Nobody wanted to see the terrible secret society provoked into the commission of further outrages. Everybody wanted the tragedy hushed up, ignored, forgotten, if possible.", "21": "And so there was a bitter surprise and an unwelcome one when Will Joyce, the blacksmith's journeyman, came out and proclaimed himself the assassin! Plainly he was not minded to be robbed of his glory. He made his proclamation, and stuck to it. Stuck to it, and insisted upon a trial. Here was an ominous thing; here was a new and peculiarly formidable terror, for a motive was revealed here which society could not hope to deal with successfully\u2014vanity, thirst for notoriety. If men were going to kill for notoriety's sake, and to win the glory of newspaper renown, a big trial, and a showy execution, what possible invention of man could discourage or deter them? The town was in a sort of panic; it did not know what to do.", "22": "However, the grand jury had to take hold of the matter\u2014it had no choice. It brought in a true bill, and presently the case went to the county court. The trial was a fine sensation. The prisoner was the principal witness for the prosecution. He gave a full account of the assassination; he furnished even the minutest particulars: how he deposited his keg of powder and laid his train\u2014from the house to such-and-such a spot; how George Ronalds and Henry Hart came along just then, smoking, and he borrowed Hart's cigar and fired the train with it, shouting, \u201cDown with all slave-tyrants!\u201d and how Hart and Ronalds made no effort to capture him, but ran away, and had never come forward to testify yet.", "23": "But they had to testify now, and they did\u2014and pitiful it was to see how reluctant they were, and how scared. The crowded house listened to Joyce's fearful tale with a profound and breathless interest, and in a deep hush which was not broken till he broke it himself, in concluding, with a roaring repetition of his \u201cDeath to all slave-tyrants!\u201d\u2014which came so unexpectedly and so startlingly that it made everyone present catch his breath and gasp.", "24": "The trial was put in the paper, with biography and large portrait, with other slanderous and insane pictures, and the edition sold beyond imagination.", "25": "The execution of Joyce was a fine and picturesque thing. It drew a vast crowd. Good places in trees and seats on rail fences sold for half a dollar apiece; lemonade and gingerbread-stands had great prosperity. Joyce recited a furious and fantastic and denunciatory speech on the scaffold which had imposing passages of school-boy eloquence in it, and gave him a reputation on the spot as an orator, and his name, later, in the society's records, of the \u201cMartyr Orator.\u201d He went to his death breathing slaughter and charging his society to \u201cavenge his murder.\u201d If he knew anything of human nature he knew that to plenty of young fellows present in that great crowd he was a grand hero\u2014and enviably situated.", "26": "He was hanged. It was a mistake. Within a month from his death the society which he had honored had twenty new members, some of them earnest, determined men. They did not court distinction in the same way, but they celebrated his martyrdom. The crime which had been obscure and despised had become lofty and glorified.", "27": "Such things were happening all over the country. Wild-brained martyrdom was succeeded by uprising and organization. Then, in natural order, followed riot, insurrection, and the wrack and restitutions of war. It was bound to come, and it would naturally come in that way. It has been the manner of reform since the beginning of the world."}, "SWITZERLAND, THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY": {"0": "It is a good many years since I was in Switzerland last. In that remote time there was only one ladder railway in the country. That state of things is all changed. There isn't a mountain in Switzerland now that hasn't a ladder railroad or two up its back like suspenders; indeed, some mountains are latticed with them, and two years hence all will be. In that day the peasant of the high altitudes will have to carry a lantern when he goes visiting in the night to keep from stumbling over railroads that have been built since his last round. And also in that day, if there shall remain a high-altitude peasant whose potato-patch hasn't a railroad through it, it will make him as conspicuous as William Tell.", "1": "However, there are only two best ways to travel through Switzerland. The first best is afoot. The second best is by open two-horse carriage. One can come from Lucerne to Interlaken over the Brunig by ladder railroad in an hour or so now, but you can glide smoothly in a carriage in ten, and have two hours for luncheon at noon\u2014for luncheon, not for rest. There is no fatigue connected with the trip. One arrives fresh in spirit and in person in the evening\u2014no fret in his heart, no grime on his face, no grit in his hair, not a cinder in his eye. This is the right condition of mind and body, the right and due preparation for the solemn event which closed the day\u2014stepping with metaphorically uncovered head into the presence of the most impressive mountain mass that the globe can show\u2014the Jungfrau. The stranger's first feeling, when suddenly confronted by that towering and awful apparition wrapped in its shroud of snow, is breath-taking astonishment. It is as if heaven's gates had swung open and exposed the throne.", "2": "It is peaceful here and pleasant at Interlaken. Nothing going on\u2014at least nothing but brilliant life-giving sunshine. There are floods and floods of that. One may properly speak of it as \u201cgoing on,\u201d for it is full of the suggestion of activity; the light pours down with energy, with visible enthusiasm. This is a good atmosphere to be in, morally as well as physically. After trying the political atmosphere of the neighboring monarchies, it is healing and refreshing to breathe in air that has known no taint of slavery for six hundred years, and to come among a people whose political history is great and fine, and worthy to be taught in all schools and studied by all races and peoples. For the struggle here throughout the centuries has not been in the interest of any private family, or any church, but in the interest of the whole body of the nation, and for shelter and protection of all forms of belief. This fact is colossal. If one would realize how colossal it is, and of what dignity and majesty, let him contrast it with the purposes and objects of the Crusades, the siege of York, the War of the Roses, and other historic comedies of that sort and size.", "3": "Last week I was beating around the Lake of Four Cantons, and I saw Rutli and Altorf. Rutli is a remote little patch of a meadow, but I do not know how any piece of ground could be holier or better worth crossing oceans and continents to see, since it was there that the great trinity of Switzerland joined hands six centuries ago and swore the oath which set their enslaved and insulted country forever free; and Altorf is also honorable ground and worshipful, since it was there that William, surnamed Tell (which interpreted means \u201cThe foolish talker\u201d\u2014that is to say, the too-daring talker), refused to bow to Gessler's hat. Of late years the prying student of history has been delighting himself beyond measure over a wonderful find which he has made\u2014to wit, that Tell did not shoot the apple from his son's head. To hear the students jubilate, one would suppose that the question of whether Tell shot the apple or didn't was an important matter; whereas it ranks in importance exactly with the question of whether Washington chopped down the cherry-tree or didn't. The deeds of Washington, the patriot, are the essential thing; the cherry-tree incident is of no consequence. To prove that Tell did shoot the apple from his son's head would merely prove that he had better nerve than most men and was as skillful with a bow as a million others who preceded and followed him, but not one whit more so. But Tell was more and better than a mere marksman, more and better than a mere cool head; he was a type; he stands for Swiss patriotism; in his person was represented a whole people; his spirit was their spirit\u2014the spirit which would bow to none but God, the spirit which said this in words and confirmed it with deeds. There have always been Tells in Switzerland\u2014people who would not bow. There was a sufficiency of them at Rutli; there were plenty of them at Murten; plenty at Grandson; there are plenty today. And the first of them all\u2014the very first, earliest banner-bearer of human freedom in this world\u2014was not a man, but a woman\u2014Stauffacher's wife. There she looms dim and great, through the haze of the centuries, delivering into her husband's ear that gospel of revolt which was to bear fruit in the conspiracy of Rutli and the birth of the first free government the world had ever seen.", "4": "From this Victoria Hotel one looks straight across a flat of trifling width to a lofty mountain barrier, which has a gateway in it shaped like an inverted pyramid. Beyond this gateway arises the vast bulk of the Jungfrau, a spotless mass of gleaming snow, into the sky. The gateway, in the dark-colored barrier, makes a strong frame for the great picture. The somber frame and the glowing snow-pile are startlingly contrasted. It is this frame which concentrates and emphasizes the glory of the Jungfrau and makes it the most engaging and beguiling and fascinating spectacle that exists on the earth. There are many mountains of snow that are as lofty as the Jungfrau and as nobly proportioned, but they lack the frame. They stand at large; they are intruded upon and elbowed by neighboring domes and summits, and their grandeur is diminished and fails of effect.", "5": "It is a good name, Jungfrau\u2014Virgin. Nothing could be whiter; nothing could be purer; nothing could be saintlier of aspect. At six yesterday evening the great intervening barrier seen through a faint bluish haze seemed made of air and substanceless, so soft and rich it was, so shimmering where the wandering lights touched it and so dim where the shadows lay. Apparently it was a dream stuff, a work of the imagination, nothing real about it. The tint was green, slightly varying shades of it, but mainly very dark. The sun was down\u2014as far as that barrier was concerned, but not for the Jungfrau, towering into the heavens beyond the gateway. She was a roaring conflagration of blinding white.", "6": "It is said the Fridolin (the old Fridolin), a new saint, but formerly a missionary, gave the mountain its gracious name. He was an Irishman, son of an Irish king\u2014there were thirty thousand kings reigning in County Cork alone in his time, fifteen hundred years ago. It got so that they could not make a living, there was so much competition and wages got cut so. Some of them were out of work months at a time, with wife and little children to feed, and not a crust in the place. At last a particularly severe winter fell upon the country, and hundreds of them were reduced to mendicancy and were to be seen day after day in the bitterest weather, standing barefoot in the snow, holding out their crowns for alms. Indeed, they would have been obliged to emigrate or starve but for a fortunate idea of Prince Fridolin's, who started a labor-union, the first one in history, and got the great bulk of them to join it. He thus won the general gratitude, and they wanted to make him emperor\u2014emperor over them all\u2014emperor of County Cork, but he said, No, walking delegate was good enough for him. For behold! he was modest beyond his years, and keen as a whip. To this day in Germany and Switzerland, where St. Fridolin is revered and honored, the peasantry speak of him affectionately as the first walking delegate.", "7": "The first walk he took was into France and Germany, missionarying\u2014for missionarying was a better thing in those days than it is in ours. All you had to do was to cure the head savage's sick daughter by a \u201cmiracle\u201d\u2014a miracle like the miracle of Lourdes in our day, for instance\u2014and immediately that head savage was your convert, and filled to the eyes with a new convert's enthusiasm. You could sit down and make yourself easy, now. He would take an ax and convert the rest of the nation himself. Charlemagne was that kind of a walking delegate.", "8": "Yes, there were great missionaries in those days, for the methods were sure and the rewards great. We have no such missionaries now, and no such methods.", "9": "But to continue the history of the first walking delegate, if you are interested. I am interested myself because I have seen his relics in Sackingen, and also the very spot where he worked his great miracle\u2014the one which won him his sainthood in the papal court a few centuries later. To have seen these things makes me feel very near to him, almost like a member of the family, in fact. While wandering about the Continent he arrived at the spot on the Rhine which is now occupied by Sackingen, and proposed to settle there, but the people warned him off. He appealed to the king of the Franks, who made him a present of the whole region, people and all. He built a great cloister there for women and proceeded to teach in it and accumulate more land. There were two wealthy brothers in the neighborhood, Urso and Landulph. Urso died and Fridolin claimed his estates. Landulph asked for documents and papers. Fridolin had none to show. He said the bequest had been made to him by word of mouth. Landulph suggested that he produce a witness and said it in a way which he thought was very witty, very sarcastic. This shows that he did not know the walking delegate. Fridolin was not disturbed. He said:", "10": "\u201cAppoint your court. I will bring a witness.\u201d", "11": "The court thus created consisted of fifteen counts and barons. A day was appointed for the trial of the case. On that day the judges took their seats in state, and proclamation was made that the court was ready for business. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes passed, and yet no Fridolin appeared. Landulph rose, and was in the act of claiming judgment by default when a strange clacking sound was heard coming up the stairs. In another moment Fridolin entered at the door and came walking in a deep hush down the middle aisle, with a tall skeleton stalking in his rear.", "12": "Amazement and terror sat upon every countenance, for everybody suspected that the skeleton was Urso's. It stopped before the chief judge and raised its bony arm aloft and began to speak, while all the assembly shuddered, for they could see the words leak out between its ribs. It said:", "13": "\u201cBrother, why dost thou disturb my blessed rest and withhold by robbery the gift which I gave thee for the honor of God?\u201d", "14": "It seems a strange thing and most irregular, but the verdict was actually given against Landulph on the testimony of this wandering rack-heap of unidentified bones. In our day a skeleton would not be allowed to testify at all, for a skeleton has no moral responsibility, and its word could not be believed on oath, and this was probably one of them. Most skeletons are not to be believed on oath, and this was probably one of them. However, the incident is valuable as preserving to us a curious sample of the quaint laws of evidence of that remote time--a time so remote, so far back toward the beginning of original idiocy, that the difference between a bench of judges and a basket of vegetables was as yet so slight that we may say with all confidence that it didn't really exist.", "15": "During several afternoons I have been engaged in an interesting, maybe useful, piece of work\u2014that is to say, I have been trying to make the mighty Jungfrau earn her living\u2014earn it in a most humble sphere, but on a prodigious scale, on a prodigious scale of necessity, for she couldn't do anything in a small way with her size and style. I have been trying to make her do service on a stupendous dial and check off the hours as they glide along her pallid face up there against the sky, and tell the time of day to the populations lying within fifty miles of her and to the people in the moon, if they have a good telescope there.", "16": "Until late in the afternoon the Jungfrau's aspect is that of a spotless desert of snow set upon edge against the sky. But by mid-afternoon some elevations which rise out of the western border of the desert, whose presence you perhaps had not detected or suspected up to that time, began to cast black shadows eastward across the gleaming surface. At first there is only one shadow; later there are two. Toward 4 P.M. the other day I was gazing and worshiping as usual when I chanced to notice that shadow No. 1 was beginning to take itself something of the shape of the human profile. By four the back of the head was good, the military cap was pretty good, the nose was bold and strong, the upper lip sharp, but not pretty, and there was a great goatee that shot straight aggressively forward from the chin.", "17": "At four-thirty the nose had changed its shape considerably, and the altered slant of the sun had revealed and made conspicuous a huge buttress or barrier of naked rock which was so located as to answer very well for a shoulder or coat-collar to this swarthy and indiscreet sweetheart who had stolen out there right before everybody to pillow his head on the Virgin's white breast and whisper soft sentimentalities to her in the sensuous music of the crashing ice-domes and the boom and thunder of the passing avalanche\u2014music very familiar to his ear, for he has heard it every afternoon at this hour since the day he first came courting this child of the earth, who lives in the sky, and that day is far, yes\u2014for he was at this pleasant sport before the Middle Ages drifted by him in the valley; before the Romans marched past, and before the antique and recordless barbarians fished and hunted here and wondered who he might be, and were probably afraid of him; and before primeval man himself, just emerged from his four-footed estate, stepped out upon this plain, first sample of his race, a thousand centuries ago, and cast a glad eye up there, judging he had found a brother human being and consequently something to kill; and before the big saurians wallowed here, still some eons earlier. Oh yes, a day so far back that the eternal son was present to see that first visit; a day so far back that neither tradition nor history was born yet and a whole weary eternity must come and go before the restless little creature, of whose face this stupendous Shadow Face was the prophecy, would arrive in the earth and begin his shabby career and think it a big thing. Oh, indeed yes; when you talk about your poor Roman and Egyptian day-before-yesterday antiquities, you should choose a time when the hoary Shadow Face of the Jungfrau is not by. It antedates all antiquities known or imaginable; for it was here the world itself created the theater of future antiquities. And it is the only witness with a human face that was there to see the marvel, and remains to us a memorial of it.", "18": "By 4:40 P.M. the nose of the shadow is perfect and is beautiful. It is black and is powerfully marked against the upright canvas of glowing snow, and covers hundreds of acres of that resplendent surface.", "19": "Meantime shadow No. 2 has been creeping out well to the rear of the face west of it\u2014and at five o'clock has assumed a shape that has rather a poor and rude semblance of a shoe.", "20": "Meantime, also, the great Shadow Face has been gradually changing for twenty minutes, and now, 5 P.M., it is becoming a quite fair portrait of Roscoe Conkling. The likeness is there, and is unmistakable. The goatee is shortened, now, and has an end; formerly it hadn't any, but ran off eastward and arrived nowhere.", "21": "By 6 P.M. the face has dissolved and gone, and the goatee has become what looks like the shadow of a tower with a pointed roof, and the shoe had turned into what the printers call a \u201cfist\u201d with a finger pointing.", "22": "If I were now imprisoned on a mountain summit a hundred miles northward of this point, and was denied a timepiece, I could get along well enough from four till six on clear days, for I could keep trace of the time by the changing shapes of these mighty shadows on the Virgin's front, the most stupendous dial I am acquainted with, the oldest clock in the world by a couple of million years.", "23": "I suppose I should not have noticed the forms of the shadows if I hadn't the habit of hunting for faces in the clouds and in mountain crags\u2014a sort of amusement which is very entertaining even when you don't find any, and brilliantly satisfying when you do. I have searched through several bushels of photographs of the Jungfrau here, but found only one with the Face in it, and in this case it was not strictly recognizable as a face, which was evidence that the picture was taken before four o'clock in the afternoon, and also evidence that all the photographers have persistently overlooked one of the most fascinating features of the Jungfrau show. I say fascinating, because if you once detect a human face produced on a great plan by unconscious nature, you never get tired of watching it. At first you can't make another person see it at all, but after he has made it out once he can't see anything else afterward.", "24": "The King of Greece is a man who goes around quietly enough when off duty.

By and by a hearty and healthy German-American got in and opened up a frank and interesting and sympathetic conversation with him, and asked him a couple of thousand questions about himself, which the king answered good-naturedly, but in a more or less indefinite way as to private particulars.", "25": "\u201cWhere do you live when you are at home?\u201d", "26": "\u201cIn Greece.\u201d", "27": "\u201cGreece!

WAGNER": {"0": "It was at Nuremberg that we struck the inundation of music-mad strangers that was rolling down upon Bayreuth. It had been long since we had seen such multitudes of excited and struggling people. It took a good half-hour to pack them and pair them into the train\u2014and it was the longest train we have yet seen in Europe. Nuremberg had been witnessing this sort of experience a couple of times a day for about two weeks. It gives one an impressive sense of the magnitude of this biennial pilgrimage. For a pilgrimage is what it is. The devotees come from the very ends of the earth to worship their prophet in his own Kaaba in his own Mecca.", "1": "If you are living in New York or San Francisco or Chicago or anywhere else in America, and you conclude, by the middle of May, that you would like to attend the Bayreuth opera two months and a half later, you must use the cable and get about it immediately or you will get no seats, and you must cable for lodgings, too. Then if you are lucky you will get seats in the last row and lodgings in the fringe of the town. If you stop to write you will get nothing. There were plenty of people in Nuremberg when we passed through who had come on pilgrimage without first securing seats and lodgings. They had found neither in Bayreuth; they had walked Bayreuth streets a while in sorrow, then had gone to Nuremberg and found neither beds nor standing room, and had walked those quaint streets all night, waiting for the hotels to open and empty their guests into the trains, and so make room for these, their defeated brethren and sisters in the faith. They had endured from thirty to forty hours' railroading on the continent of Europe\u2014with all which that implies of worry, fatigue, and financial impoverishment\u2014and all they had got and all they were to get for it was handiness and accuracy in kicking themselves, acquired by practice in the back streets of the two towns when other people were in bed; for back they must go over that unspeakable journey with their pious mission unfulfilled. These humiliated outcasts had the frowsy and unbrushed and apologetic look of wet cats, and their eyes were glazed with drowsiness, their bodies were adroop from crown to sole, and all kind-hearted people refrained from asking them if they had been to Bayreuth and failed to connect, as knowing they would lie.", "2": "We reached here (Bayreuth) about mid-afternoon of a rainy Saturday. We were of the wise, and had secured lodgings and opera seats months in advance.", "3": "I am not a musical critic, and did not come here to write essays about the operas and deliver judgment upon their merits. The little children of Bayreuth could do that with a finer sympathy and a broader intelligence than I. I only care to bring four or five pilgrims to the operas, pilgrims able to appreciate them and enjoy them. What I write about the performance to put in my odd time would be offered to the public as merely a cat's view of a king, and not of didactic value.", "4": "Next day, which was Sunday, we left for the opera-house\u2014that is to say, the Wagner temple\u2014a little after the middle of the afternoon. The great building stands all by itself, grand and lonely, on a high ground outside the town. We were warned that if we arrived after four o'clock we should be obliged to pay two dollars and a half apiece extra by way of fine. We saved that; and it may be remarked here that this is the only opportunity that Europe offers of saving money. There was a big crowd in the grounds about the building, and the ladies' dresses took the sun with fine effect. I do not mean to intimate that the ladies were in full dress, for that was not so. The dresses were pretty, but neither sex was in evening dress.", "5": "The interior of the building is simple\u2014severely so; but there is no occasion for color and decoration, since the people sit in the dark. The auditorium has the shape of a keystone, with the stage at the narrow end. There is an aisle on each side, but no aisle in the body of the house. Each row of seats extends in an unbroken curve from one side of the house to the other. There are seven entrance doors on each side of the theater and four at the butt, eighteen doors to admit and emit 1,650 persons. The number of the particular door by which you are to enter the house or leave it is printed on your ticket, and you can use no door but that one. Thus, crowding and confusion are impossible. Not so many as a hundred people use any one door. This is better than having the usual (and useless) elaborate fireproof arrangements. It is the model theater of the world. It can be emptied while the second hand of a watch makes its circuit. It would be entirely safe, even if it were built of lucifer matches.", "6": "If your seat is near the center of a row and you enter late you must work your way along a rank of about twenty-five ladies and gentlemen to get to it. Yet this causes no trouble, for everybody stands up until all the seats are full, and the filling is accomplished in a very few minutes. Then all sit down, and you have a solid mass of fifteen hundred heads, making a steep cellar-door slant from the rear of the house down to the stage.", "7": "All the lights were turned low, so low that the congregation sat in a deep and solemn gloom. The funereal rustling of dresses and the low buzz of conversation began to die swiftly down, and presently not the ghost of a sound was left. This profound and increasingly impressive stillness endured for some time\u2014the best preparation for music, spectacle, or speech conceivable. I should think our show people would have invented or imported that simple and impressive device for securing and solidifying the attention of an audience long ago; instead of which they continue to this day to open a performance against a deadly competition in the form of noise, confusion, and a scattered interest.", "8": "Finally, out of darkness and distance and mystery soft rich notes rose upon the stillness, and from his grave the dead magician began to weave his spells about his disciples and steep their souls in his enchantments. There was something strangely impressive in the fancy which kept intruding itself that the composer was conscious in his grave of what was going on here, and that these divine sounds were the clothing of thoughts which were at this moment passing through his brain, and not recognized and familiar ones which had issued from it at some former time.", "9": "The entire overture, long as it was, was played to a dark house with the curtain down. It was exquisite; it was delicious. But straightway thereafter, of course, came the singing, and it does seem to me that nothing can make a Wagner opera absolutely perfect and satisfactory to the untutored but to leave out the vocal parts. I wish I could see a Wagner opera done in pantomime once. Then one would have the lovely orchestration unvexed to listen to and bathe his spirit in, and the bewildering beautiful scenery to intoxicate his eyes with, and the dumb acting couldn't mar these pleasures, because there isn't often anything in the Wagner opera that one would call by such a violent name as acting; as a rule all you would see would be a couple of silent people, one of them standing still, the other catching flies. Of course I do not really mean that he would be catching flies; I only mean that the usual operatic gestures which consist in reaching first one hand out into the air and then the other might suggest the sport I speak of if the operator attended strictly to business and uttered no sound.", "10": "This present opera was \u201cParsifal.\u201d Madame Wagner does not permit its representation anywhere but in Bayreuth. The first act of the three occupied two hours, and I enjoyed that in spite of the singing.", "11": "I trust that I know as well as anybody that singing is one of the most entrancing and bewitching and moving and eloquent of all the vehicles invented by man for the conveying of feeling; but it seems to me that the chief virtue in song is melody, air, tune, rhythm, or what you please to call it, and that when this feature is absent what remains is a picture with the color left out. I was not able to detect in the vocal parts of \u201cParsifal\u201d anything that might with confidence be called rhythm or tune or melody; one person performed at a time\u2014and a long time, too\u2014often in a noble, and always in a high-toned, voice; but he only pulled out long notes, then some short ones, then another long one, then a sharp, quick, peremptory bark or two\u2014and so on and so on; and when he was done you saw that the information which he had conveyed had not compensated for the disturbance. Not always, but pretty often. If two of them would but put in a duet occasionally and blend the voices; but no, they don't do that. The great master, who knew so well how to make a hundred instruments rejoice in unison and pour out their souls in mingled and melodious tides of delicious sound, deals only in barren solos when he puts in the vocal parts. It may be that he was deep, and only added the singing to his operas for the sake of the contrast it would make with the music. Singing! It does seem the wrong name to apply to it. Strictly described, it is a practicing of difficult and unpleasant intervals, mainly. An ignorant person gets tired of listening to gymnastic intervals in the long run, no matter how pleasant they may be. In \u201cParsifal\u201d there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in one spot and practices by the hour, while first one and then another character of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires to die.", "12": "During the evening there was an intermission of three-quarters of an hour after the first act and one an hour long after the second. In both instances the theater was totally emptied. People who had previously engaged tables in the one sole eating-house were able to put in their time very satisfactorily; the other thousand went hungry. The opera was concluded at ten in the evening or a little later. When we reached home we had been gone more than seven hours. Seven hours at five dollars a ticket is almost too much for the money.", "13": "While browsing about the front yard among the crowd between the acts I encountered twelve or fifteen friends from different parts of America, and those of them who were most familiar with Wagner said that \u201cParsifal\u201d seldom pleased at first, but that after one had heard it several times it was almost sure to become a favorite. It seemed impossible, but it was true, for the statement came from people whose word was not to be doubted.", "14": "And I gathered some further information. On the ground I found part of a German musical magazine, and in it a letter written by Uhlic thirty-three years ago, in which he defends the scorned and abused Wagner against people like me, who found fault with the comprehensive absence of what our kind regards as singing. Uhlic says Wagner despised \u201cjene plapperude music,\u201d and therefore \u201cruns, trills, and Schnorkel are discarded by him.\u201d I don't know what a Schnorkel is, but now that I know it has been left out of these operas I never have missed so much in my life. And Uhlic further says that Wagner's song is true: that it is \u201csimply emphasized intoned speech.\u201d That certainly describes it\u2014in \u201cParsifal\u201d and some of the other operas; and if I understand Uhlic's elaborate German he apologizes for the beautiful airs in \u201cTannhauser.\u201d Very well; now that Wagner and I understand each other, perhaps we shall get along better, and I shall stop calling Waggner, on the American plan, and thereafter call him Waggner as per German custom, for I feel entirely friendly now. The minute we get reconciled to a person, how willing we are to throw aside little needless punctilios and pronounce his name right!", "15": "Of course I came home wondering why people should come from all corners of America to hear these operas, when we have lately had a season or two of them in New York with these same singers in the several parts, and possibly this same orchestra. I resolved to think that out at all hazards.", "16": "TUESDAY.\u2014Yesterday they played the only operatic favorite I have ever had\u2014an opera which has always driven me mad with ignorant delight whenever I have heard it\u2014\u201cTannhauser.\u201d I heard it first when I was a youth; I heard it last in the last German season in New York. I was busy yesterday and I did not intend to go, knowing I should have another \u201cTannhauser\u201d opportunity in a few days; but after five o'clock I found myself free and walked out to the opera-house and arrived about the beginning of the second act. My opera ticket admitted me to the grounds in front, past the policeman and the chain, and I thought I would take a rest on a bench for an hour and two and wait for the third act.", "17": "In a moment or so the first bugles blew, and the multitude began to crumble apart and melt into the theater. I will explain that this bugle-call is one of the pretty features here. You see, the theater is empty, and hundreds of the audience are a good way off in the feeding-house; the first bugle-call is blown about a quarter of an hour before time for the curtain to rise. This company of buglers, in uniform, march out with military step and send out over the landscape a few bars of the theme of the approaching act, piercing the distances with the gracious notes; then they march to the other entrance and repeat. Presently they do this over again. Yesterday only about two hundred people were still left in front of the house when the second call was blown; in another half-minute they would have been in the house, but then a thing happened which delayed them\u2014the only solitary thing in this world which could be relied on with certainty to accomplish this, I suppose\u2014an imperial princess appeared in the balcony above them. They stopped dead in their tracks and began to gaze in a stupor of gratitude and satisfaction. The lady presently saw that she must disappear or the doors would be closed upon these worshipers, so she returned to her box. This daughter-in-law of an emperor was pretty; she had a kind face; she was without airs; she is known to be full of common human sympathies. There are many kinds of princesses, but this kind is the most harmful of all, for wherever they go they reconcile people to monarchy and set back the clock of progress. The valuable princes, the desirable princes, are the czars and their sort. By their mere dumb presence in the world they cover with derision every argument that can be invented in favor of royalty by the most ingenious casuist. In his time the husband of this princess was valuable. He led a degraded life, he ended it with his own hand in circumstances and surroundings of a hideous sort, and was buried like a god.", "18": "In the opera-house there is a long loft back of the audience, a kind of open gallery, in which princes are displayed. It is sacred to them; it is the holy of holies. As soon as the filling of the house is about complete the standing multitude turn and fix their eyes upon the princely layout and gaze mutely and longingly and adoringly and regretfully like sinners looking into heaven. They become rapt, unconscious, steeped in worship. There is no spectacle anywhere that is more pathetic than this. It is worth crossing many oceans to see. It is somehow not the same gaze that people rivet upon a Victor Hugo, or Niagara, or the bones of the mastodon, or the guillotine of the Revolution, or the great pyramid, or distant Vesuvius smoking in the sky, or any man long celebrated to you by his genius and achievements, or thing long celebrated to you by the praises of books and pictures\u2014no, that gaze is only the gaze of intense curiosity, interest, wonder, engaged in drinking delicious deep draughts that taste good all the way down and appease and satisfy the thirst of a lifetime. Satisfy it\u2014that is the word. Hugo and the mastodon will still have a degree of intense interest thereafter when encountered, but never anything approaching the ecstasy of that first view. The interest of a prince is different. It may be envy, it may be worship, doubtless it is a mixture of both\u2014and it does not satisfy its thirst with one view, or even noticeably diminish it. Perhaps the essence of the thing is the value which men attach to a valuable something which has come by luck and not been earned. A dollar picked up in the road is more satisfaction to you than the ninety-and-nine which you had to work for, and money won at faro or in stocks snuggles into your heart in the same way. A prince picks up grandeur, power, and a permanent holiday and gratis support by a pure accident, the accident of birth, and he stands always before the grieved eye of poverty and obscurity a monumental representative of luck. And then\u2014supremest value of all-his is the only high fortune on the earth which is secure. The commercial millionaire may become a beggar; the illustrious statesman can make a vital mistake and be dropped and forgotten; the illustrious general can lose a decisive battle and with it the consideration of men; but once a prince always a prince\u2014that is to say, an imitation god, and neither hard fortune nor an infamous character nor an addled brain nor the speech of an ass can undeify him. By common consent of all the nations and all the ages the most valuable thing in this world is the homage of men, whether deserved or undeserved. It follows without doubt or question, then, that the most desirable position possible is that of a prince. And I think it also follows that the so-called usurpations with which history is littered are the most excusable misdemeanors which men have committed. To usurp a usurpation\u2014that is all it amounts to, isn't it?", "19": "A prince is not to us what he is to a European, of course. We have not been taught to regard him as a god, and so one good look at him is likely to so nearly appease our curiosity as to make him an object of no greater interest the next time. We want a fresh one. But it is not so with the European. I am quite sure of it. The same old one will answer; he never stales. Eighteen years ago I was in London and I called at an Englishman's house on a bleak and foggy and dismal December afternoon to visit his wife and married daughter by appointment. I waited half an hour and then they arrived, frozen. They explained that they had been delayed by an unlooked-for circumstance: while passing in the neighborhood of Marlborough House they saw a crowd gathering and were told that the Prince of Wales was about to drive out, so they stopped to get a sight of him. They had waited half an hour on the sidewalk, freezing with the crowd, but were disappointed at last\u2014the Prince had changed his mind. I said, with a good deal of surprise, \u201cIs it possible that you two have lived in London all your lives and have never seen the Prince of Wales?\u201d", "20": "Apparently it was their turn to be surprised, for they exclaimed: \u201cWhat an idea! Why, we have seen him hundreds of times.\u201d", "21": "They had seen him hundreds of times, yet they had waited half an hour in the gloom and the bitter cold, in the midst of a jam of patients from the same asylum, on the chance of seeing him again. It was a stupefying statement, but one is obliged to believe the English, even when they say a thing like that. I fumbled around for a remark, and got out this one:", "22": "\u201cI can't understand it at all. If I had never seen General Grant I doubt if I would do that even to get a sight of him.\u201d With a slight emphasis on the last word.", "23": "Their blank faces showed that they wondered where the parallel came in. Then they said, blankly: \u201cOf course not. He is only a President.\u201d", "24": "It is doubtless a fact that a prince is a permanent interest, an interest not subject to deterioration. The general who was never defeated, the general who never held a council of war, the only general who ever commanded a connected battle-front twelve hundred miles long, the smith who welded together the broken parts of a great republic and re-established it where it is quite likely to outlast all the monarchies present and to come, was really a person of no serious consequence to these people. To them, with their training, my General was only a man, after all, while their Prince was clearly much more than that\u2014a being of a wholly unsimilar construction and constitution, and being of no more blood and kinship with men than are the serene eternal lights of the firmament with the poor dull tallow candles of commerce that sputter and die and leave nothing behind but a pinch of ashes and a stink.", "25": "I saw the last act of \u201cTannhauser.\u201d I sat in the gloom and the deep stillness, waiting\u2014one minute, two minutes, I do not know exactly how long\u2014then the soft music of the hidden orchestra began to breathe its rich, long sighs out from under the distant stage, and by and by the drop-curtain parted in the middle and was drawn softly aside, disclosing the twilighted wood and a wayside shrine, with a white-robed girl praying and a man standing near. Presently that noble chorus of men's voices was heard approaching, and from that moment until the closing of the curtain it was music, just music\u2014music to make one drunk with pleasure, music to make one take scrip and staff and beg his way round the globe to hear it.", "26": "To such as are intending to come here in the Wagner season next year I wish to say, bring your dinner-pail with you. If you do, you will never cease to be thankful. If you do not, you will find it a hard fight to save yourself from famishing in Bayreuth. Bayreuth is merely a large village, and has no very large hotels or eating-houses. The principal inns are the Golden Anchor and the Sun. At either of these places you can get an excellent meal\u2014no, I mean you can go there and see other people get it. There is no charge for this. The town is littered with restaurants, but they are small and bad, and they are overdriven with custom. You must secure a table hours beforehand, and often when you arrive you will find somebody occupying it. We have had this experience. We have had a daily scramble for life; and when I say we, I include shoals of people. I have the impression that the only people who do not have to scramble are the veterans\u2014the disciples who have been here before and know the ropes. I think they arrive about a week before the first opera, and engage all the tables for the season. My tribe had tried all kinds of places\u2014some outside of the town, a mile or two\u2014and have captured only nibblings and odds and ends, never in any instance a complete and satisfying meal. Digestible? No, the reverse. These odds and ends are going to serve as souvenirs of Bayreuth, and in that regard their value is not to be overestimated. Photographs fade, bric-a-brac gets lost, busts of Wagner get broken, but once you absorb a Bayreuth-restaurant meal it is your possession and your property until the time comes to embalm the rest of you. Some of these pilgrims here become, in effect, cabinets; cabinets of souvenirs of Bayreuth. It is believed among scientists that you could examine the crop of a dead Bayreuth pilgrim anywhere in the earth and tell where he came from. But I like this ballast. I think a \u201cHermitage\u201d scrap-up at eight in the evening, when all the famine-breeders have been there and laid in their mementoes and gone, is the quietest thing you can lay on your keelson except gravel.", "27": "THURSDAY.\u2014They keep two teams of singers in stock for the chief roles, and one of these is composed of the most renowned artists in the world, with Materna and Alvary in the lead. I suppose a double team is necessary; doubtless a single team would die of exhaustion in a week, for all the plays last from four in the afternoon till ten at night. Nearly all the labor falls upon the half-dozen head singers, and apparently they are required to furnish all the noise they can for the money. If they feel a soft, whispery, mysterious feeling they are required to open out and let the public know it. Operas are given only on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with three days of ostensible rest per week, and two teams to do the four operas; but the ostensible rest is devoted largely to rehearsing. It is said that the off days are devoted to rehearsing from some time in the morning till ten at night. Are there two orchestras also? It is quite likely, since there are one hundred and ten names in the orchestra list.", "28": "Yesterday the opera was \u201cTristan and Isolde.\u201d I have seen all sorts of audiences\u2014at theaters, operas, concerts, lectures, sermons, funerals\u2014but none which was twin to the Wagner audience of Bayreuth for fixed and reverential attention. Absolute attention and petrified retention to the end of an act of the attitude assumed at the beginning of it. You detect no movement in the solid mass of heads and shoulders. You seem to sit with the dead in the gloom of a tomb. You know that they are being stirred to their profoundest depths; that there are times when they want to rise and wave handkerchiefs and shout their approbation, and times when tears are running down their faces, and it would be a relief to free their pent emotions in sobs or screams; yet you hear not one utterance till the curtain swings together and the closing strains have slowly faded out and died; then the dead rise with one impulse and shake the building with their applause. Every seat is full in the first act; there is not a vacant one in the last. If a man would be conspicuous, let him come here and retire from the house in the midst of an act. It would make him celebrated.", "29": "This audience reminds me of nothing I have ever seen and of nothing I have read about except the city in the Arabian tale where all the inhabitants have been turned to brass and the traveler finds them after centuries mute, motionless, and still retaining the attitudes which they last knew in life. Here the Wagner audience dress as they please, and sit in the dark and worship in silence. At the Metropolitan in New York they sit in a glare, and wear their showiest harness; they hum airs, they squeak fans, they titter, and they gabble all the time. In some of the boxes the conversation and laughter are so loud as to divide the attention of the house with the stage. In large measure the Metropolitan is a show-case for rich fashionables who are not trained in Wagnerian music and have no reverence for it, but who like to promote art and show their clothes.", "30": "Can that be an agreeable atmosphere to persons in whom this music produces a sort of divine ecstasy and to whom its creator is a very deity, his stage a temple, the works of his brain and hands consecrated things, and the partaking of them with eye and ear a sacred solemnity? Manifestly, no. Then, perhaps the temporary expatriation, the tedious traversing of seas and continents, the pilgrimage to Bayreuth stands explained. These devotees would worship in an atmosphere of devotion. It is only here that they can find it without fleck or blemish or any worldly pollution. In this remote village there are no sights to see, there is no newspaper to intrude the worries of the distant world, there is nothing going on, it is always Sunday. The pilgrim wends to his temple out of town, sits out his moving service, returns to his bed with his heart and soul and his body exhausted by long hours of tremendous emotion, and he is in no fit condition to do anything but to lie torpid and slowly gather back life and strength for the next service. This opera of \u201cTristan and Isolde\u201d last night broke the hearts of all witnesses who were of the faith, and I know of some who have heard of many who could not sleep after it, but cried the night away. I feel strongly out of place here. Sometimes I feel like the sane person in a community of the mad; sometimes I feel like the one blind man where all others see; the one groping savage in the college of the learned, and always, during service, I feel like a heretic in heaven.", "31": "But by no means do I ever overlook or minify the fact that this is one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life. I have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen anything so great and fine and real as this devotion.", "32": "FRIDAY.\u2014Yesterday's opera was \u201cParsifal\u201d again. The others went and they show marked advance in appreciation; but I went hunting for relics and reminders of the Margravine Wilhelmina, she of the imperishable \u201cMemoirs.\u201d I am properly grateful to her for her (unconscious) satire upon monarchy and nobility, and therefore nothing which her hand touched or her eye looked upon is indifferent to me. I am her pilgrim; the rest of this multitude here are Wagner's.", "33": "TUESDAY.\u2014I have seen my last two operas; my season is ended, and we cross over into Bohemia this afternoon. I was supposing that my musical regeneration was accomplished and perfected, because I enjoyed both of these operas, singing and all, and, moreover, one of them was \u201cParsifal,\u201d but the experts have disenchanted me. They say:", "34": "\u201cSinging! That wasn't singing; that was the wailing, screeching of third-rate obscurities, palmed off on us in the interest of economy.\u201d", "35": "Well, I ought to have recognized the sign\u2014the old, sure sign that has never failed me in matters of art. Whenever I enjoy anything in art it means that it is mighty poor. The private knowledge of this fact has saved me from going to pieces with enthusiasm in front of many and many a chromo. However, my base instinct does bring me profit sometimes; I was the only man out of thirty-two hundred who got his money back on those two operas."}, "WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS": {"0": "Is it true that the sun of a man's mentality touches noon at forty and then begins to wane toward setting? Doctor Osler is charged with saying so. Maybe he said it, maybe he didn't; I don't know which it is. But if he said it, I can point him to a case which proves his rule. Proves it by being an exception to it. To this place I nominate Mr. Howells.", "1": "I read his Venetian Days about forty years ago. I compare it with his paper on Machiavelli in a late number of Harper, and I cannot find that his English has suffered any impairment. For forty years his English has been to me a continual delight and astonishment. In the sustained exhibition of certain great qualities\u2014clearness, compression, verbal exactness, and unforced and seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing\u2014he is, in my belief, without his peer in the English-writing world. sustained. I entrench myself behind that protecting word. There are others who exhibit those great qualities as greatly as he does, but only by intervaled distributions of rich moonlight, with stretches of veiled and dimmer landscape between; whereas Howells's moon sails cloudless skies all night and all the nights.", "2": "In the matter of verbal exactness Mr. Howells has no superior, I suppose. He seems to be almost always able to find that elusive and shifty grain of gold, the right word. Others have to put up with approximations, more or less frequently; he has better luck. To me, the others are miners working with the gold-pan\u2014of necessity some of the gold washes over and escapes; whereas, in my fancy, he is quicksilver raiding down a riffle\u2014no grain of the metal stands much chance of eluding him. A powerful agent is the right word: it lights the reader's way and makes it plain; a close approximation to it will answer, and much traveling is done in a well-enough fashion by its help, but we do not welcome it and applaud it and rejoice in it as we do when the right one blazes out on us. Whenever we come upon one of those intensely right words in a book or a newspaper the resulting effect is physical as well as spiritual, and electrically prompt: it tingles exquisitely around through the walls of the mouth and tastes as tart and crisp and good as the autumn-butter that creams the sumac-berry. One has no time to examine the word and vote upon its rank and standing, the automatic recognition of its supremacy is so immediate. There is a plenty of acceptable literature which deals largely in approximations, but it may be likened to a fine landscape seen through the rain; the right word would dismiss the rain, then you would see it better. It doesn't rain when Howells is at work.", "3": "And where does he get the easy and effortless flow of his speech? and its cadenced and undulating rhythm? and its architectural felicities of construction, its graces of expression, its pemmican quality of compression, and all that? Born to him, no doubt. All in shining good order in the beginning, all extraordinary; and all just as shining, just as extraordinary today, after forty years of diligent wear and tear and use. He passed his fortieth year long and long ago; but I think his English of today\u2014his perfect English, I wish to say\u2014can throw down the glove before his English of that antique time and not be afraid.", "4": "I will go back to the paper on Machiavelli now, and ask the reader to examine this passage from it which I append. I do not mean examine it in a bird's-eye way; I mean search it, study it. And, of course, read it aloud. I may be wrong, still it is my conviction that one cannot get out of finely wrought literature all that is in it by reading it mutely:", "5": "Mr. Dyer is rather of the opinion, first luminously suggested by Macaulay, that Machiavelli was in earnest, but must not be judged as a political moralist of our time and race would be judged. He thinks that Machiavelli was in earnest, as none but an idealist can be, and he is the first to imagine him an idealist immersed in realities, who involuntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like the visionary issues of reverie. The Machiavelli whom he depicts does not cease to be politically a republican and socially a just man because he holds up an atrocious despot like Caesar Borgia as a mirror for rulers. What Machiavelli beheld round him in Italy was a civic disorder in which there was oppression without statecraft, and revolt without patriotism. When a miscreant like Borgia appeared upon the scene and reduced both tyrants and rebels to an apparent quiescence, he might very well seem to such a dreamer the savior of society whom a certain sort of dreamers are always looking for. Machiavelli was no less honest when he honored the diabolical force of Caesar Borgia than Carlyle was when at different times he extolled the strong man who destroys liberty in creating order. But Carlyle has only just ceased to be mistaken for a reformer, while it is still Machiavelli's hard fate to be so trammeled in his material that his name stands for whatever is most malevolent and perfidious in human nature.", "6": "You see how easy and flowing it is; how unvexed by ruggednesses, clumsinesses, broken meters; how simple and\u2014so far as you or I can make out\u2014unstudied; how clear, how limpid, how understandable, how unconfused by cross-currents, eddies, undertows; how seemingly unadorned, yet is all adornment, like the lily-of-the-valley; and how compressed, how compact, without a complacency-signal hung out anywhere to call attention to it.", "7": "There are twenty-three lines in the quoted passage. After reading it several times aloud, one perceives that a good deal of matter is crowded into that small space. I think it is a model of compactness. When I take its materials apart and work them over and put them together in my way, I find I cannot crowd the result back into the same hole, there not being room enough. I find it a case of a woman packing a man's trunk: he can get the things out, but he can't ever get them back again.", "8": "The proffered paragraph is a just and fair sample; the rest of the article is as compact as it is; there are no waste words. The sample is just in other ways: limpid, fluent, graceful, and rhythmical as it is, it holds no superiority in these respects over the rest of the essay. Also, the choice phrasing noticeable in the sample is not lonely; there is a plenty of its kin distributed through the other paragraphs. This is claiming much when that kin must face the challenge of a phrase like the one in the middle sentence: \u201can idealist immersed in realities who involuntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like the visionary issues of reverie.\u201d With a hundred words to do it with, the literary artisan could catch that airy thought and tie it down and reduce it to a concrete condition, visible, substantial, understandable and all right, like a cabbage; but the artist does it with twenty, and the result is a flower.", "9": "The quoted phrase, like a thousand others that have come from the same source, has the quality of certain scraps of verse which take hold of us and stay in our memories, we do not understand why, at first: all the words being the right words, none of them is conspicuous, and so they all seem inconspicuous, therefore we wonder what it is about them that makes their message take hold.", "10": "It is like a dreamy strain of moving music, with no sharp notes in it. The words are all \u201cright\u201d words, and all the same size. We do not notice it at first. We get the effect, it goes straight home to us, but we do not know why. It is when the right words are conspicuous that they thunder:", "11": "The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome!", "12": "When I go back from Howells old to Howells young I find him arranging and clustering English words well, but not any better than now. He is not more felicitous in concreting abstractions now than he was in translating, then, the visions of the eyes of flesh into words that reproduced their forms and colors:", "13": "In Venetian streets they give the fallen snow no rest. It is at once shoveled into the canals by hundreds of half-naked FACCHINI; and now in St. Mark's Place the music of innumerable shovels smote upon my ear; and I saw the shivering legion of poverty as it engaged the elements in a struggle for the possession of the Piazza. But the snow continued to fall, and through the twilight of the descending flakes all this toil and encounter looked like that weary kind of effort in dreams, when the most determined industry seems only to renew the task. The lofty crest of the bell-tower was hidden in the folds of falling snow, and I could no longer see the golden angel upon its summit. But looked at across the Piazza, the beautiful outline of St. Mark's Church was perfectly penciled in the air, and the shifting threads of the snowfall were woven into a spell of novel enchantment around the structure that always seemed to me too exquisite in its fantastic loveliness to be anything but the creation of magic. The tender snow had compassionated the beautiful edifice for all the wrongs of time, and so hid the stains and ugliness of decay that it looked as if just from the hand of the builder\u2014or, better said, just from the brain of the architect. There was marvelous freshness in the colors of the mosaics in the great arches of the facade, and all that gracious harmony into which the temple rises, of marble scrolls and leafy exuberance airily supporting the statues of the saints, was a hundred times etherealized by the purity and whiteness of the drifting flakes. The snow lay lightly on the golden globes that tremble like peacocks-crests above the vast domes, and plumed them with softest white; it robed the saints in ermine; and it danced over all its works, as if exulting in its beauty\u2014beauty which filled me with subtle, selfish yearning to keep such evanescent loveliness for the little-while-longer of my whole life, and with despair to think that even the poor lifeless shadow of it could never be fairly reflected in picture or poem.", "14": "Through the wavering snowfall, the Saint Theodore upon one of the granite pillars of the Piazzetta did not show so grim as his wont is, and the winged lion on the other might have been a winged lamb, so gentle and mild he looked by the tender light of the storm. The towers of the island churches loomed faint and far away in the dimness; the sailors in the rigging of the ships that lay in the Basin wrought like phantoms among the shrouds; the gondolas stole in and out of the opaque distance more noiselessly and dreamily than ever; and a silence, almost palpable, lay upon the mutest city in the world.", "15": "The spirit of Venice is there: of a city where Age and Decay, fagged with distributing damage and repulsiveness among the other cities of the planet in accordance with the policy and business of their profession, come for rest and play between seasons, and treat themselves to the luxury and relaxation of sinking the shop and inventing and squandering charms all about, instead of abolishing such as they find, as is their habit when not on vacation.", "16": "In the working season they do business in Boston sometimes, and a character in the undiscovered country takes accurate note of pathetic effects wrought by them upon the aspects of a street of once dignified and elegant homes whose occupants have moved away and left them a prey to neglect and gradual ruin and progressive degradation; a descent which reaches bottom at last, when the street becomes a roost for humble professionals of the faith-cure and fortune-telling sort.", "17": "What a queer, melancholy house, what a queer, melancholy street! I don't think I was ever in a street before where quite so many professional ladies, with English surnames, preferred Madam to Mrs. on their door-plates. And the poor old place has such a desperately conscious air of going to the deuce. Every house seems to wince as you go by, and button itself up to the chin for fear you should find out it had no shirt on\u2014so to speak. I don't know what's the reason, but these material tokens of a social decay afflict me terribly; a tipsy woman isn't dreadfuler than a haggard old house, that's once been a home, in a street like this.", "18": "Mr. Howells's pictures are not mere stiff, hard, accurate photographs; they are photographs with feeling in them, and sentiment, photographs taken in a dream, one might say.", "19": "As concerns his humor, I will not try to say anything, yet I would try, if I had the words that might approximately reach up to its high place. I do not think any one else can play with humorous fancies so gracefully and delicately and deliciously as he does, nor has so many to play with, nor can come so near making them look as if they were doing the playing themselves and he was not aware that they were at it. For they are unobtrusive, and quiet in their ways, and well conducted. His is a humor which flows softly all around about and over and through the mesh of the page, pervasive, refreshing, health-giving, and makes no more show and no more noise than does the circulation of the blood.", "20": "There is another thing which is contentingly noticeable in Mr. Howells's books. That is his \u201cstage directions\u201d\u2014those artifices which authors employ to throw a kind of human naturalness around a scene and a conversation, and help the reader to see the one and get at meanings in the other which might not be perceived if entrusted unexplained to the bare words of the talk. Some authors overdo the stage directions, they elaborate them quite beyond necessity; they spend so much time and take up so much room in telling us how a person said a thing and how he looked and acted when he said it that we get tired and vexed and wish he hadn't said it at all. Other authors' directions are brief enough, but it is seldom that the brevity contains either wit or information. Writers of this school go in rags, in the matter of stage directions; the majority of them having nothing in stock but a cigar, a laugh, a blush, and a bursting into tears. In their poverty they work these sorry things to the bone. They say:", "21": "\u201c... replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar.\u201d (This explains nothing; it only wastes space.)", "22": "\u201c... responded Richard, with a laugh.\u201d (There was nothing to laugh about; there never is. The writer puts it in from habit\u2014automatically; he is paying no attention to his work; or he would see that there is nothing to laugh at; often, when a remark is unusually and poignantly flat and silly, he tries to deceive the reader by enlarging the stage direction and making Richard break into \u201cfrenzies of uncontrollable laughter.\u201d This makes the reader sad.)", "23": "\u201c... murmured Gladys, blushing.\u201d (This poor old shop-worn blush is a tiresome thing. We get so we would rather Gladys would fall out of the book and break her neck than do it again. She is always doing it, and usually irrelevantly. Whenever it is her turn to murmur she hangs out her blush; it is the only thing she's got. In a little while we hate her, just as we do Richard.)", "24": "\u201c... repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears.\u201d (This kind keep a book damp all the time. They can't say a thing without crying. They cry so much about nothing that by and by when they have something to cry ABOUT they have gone dry; they sob, and fetch nothing; we are not moved. We are only glad.)", "25": "They gravel me, these stale and overworked stage directions, these carbon films that got burnt out long ago and cannot now carry any faintest thread of light. It would be well if they could be relieved from duty and flung out in the literary back yard to rot and disappear along with the discarded and forgotten \u201csteeds\u201d and \u201chalidomes\u201d and similar stage-properties once so dear to our grandfathers. But I am friendly to Mr. Howells's stage directions; more friendly to them than to any one else's, I think. They are done with a competent and discriminating art, and are faithful to the requirements of a stage direction's proper and lawful office, which is to inform. Sometimes they convey a scene and its conditions so well that I believe I could see the scene and get the spirit and meaning of the accompanying dialogue if some one would read merely the stage directions to me and leave out the talk. For instance, a scene like this, from The Undiscovered Country:", "26": "\u201c... and she laid her arms with a beseeching gesture on her father's shoulder.\u201d", "27": "\u201c... she answered, following his gesture with a glance.\u201d", "28": "\u201c... she said, laughing nervously.\u201d", "29": "\u201c... she asked, turning swiftly upon him that strange, searching glance.\u201d", "30": "\u201c... she answered, vaguely.\u201d", "31": "\u201c... she reluctantly admitted.\u201d", "32": "\u201c... but her voice died wearily away, and she stood looking into his face with puzzled entreaty.\u201d", "33": "Mr. Howells does not repeat his forms, and does not need to; he can invent fresh ones without limit. It is mainly the repetition over and over again, by the third-rates, of worn and commonplace and juiceless forms that makes their novels such a weariness and vexation to us, I think. We do not mind one or two deliveries of their wares, but as we turn the pages over and keep on meeting them we presently get tired of them and wish they would do other things for a change.", "34": "\u201c... replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar.\u201d", "35": "\u201c... responded Richard, with a laugh.\u201d", "36": "\u201c... murmured Gladys, blushing.\u201d", "37": "\u201c... repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears.\u201d", "38": "\u201c... replied the Earl, flipping the ash from his cigar.\u201d", "39": "\u201c... responded the undertaker, with a laugh.\u201d", "40": "\u201c... murmured the chambermaid, blushing.\u201d", "41": "\u201c... repeated the burglar, bursting into tears.\u201d", "42": "\u201c... replied the conductor, flipping the ash from his cigar.\u201d", "43": "\u201c... responded Arkwright, with a laugh.\u201d", "44": "\u201c... murmured the chief of police, blushing.\u201d", "45": "\u201c... repeated the house-cat, bursting into tears.\u201d", "46": "And so on and so on; till at last it ceases to excite. I always notice stage directions, because they fret me and keep me trying to get out of their way, just as the automobiles do. At first; then by and by they become monotonous and I get run over.", "47": "Mr. Howells has done much work, and the spirit of it is as beautiful as the make of it. I have held him in admiration and affection so many years that I know by the number of those years that he is old now; but his heart isn't, nor his pen; and years do not count. Let him have plenty of them; there is profit in them for us."}, "ENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHT": {"0": "Cato's Soliloquy.\u2014One day Mrs. Gastrel set a little girl to repeat to him (Dr. Samuel Johnson) Cato's Soliloquy, which she went through very correctly.

The augurs could read entrails as easily as a modern child can read coarse print. Roman history is full of the marvels of interpretation which these extraordinary men performed. These strange and wonderful achievements move our awe and compel our admiration. Those men could pierce to the marrow of a mystery instantly.

These unspeakable conditions continued during nineteen years. Then Stephen died as comfortably as any man ever did, and was honorably buried. It makes one pity the poor Archbishop, and wish that he, too, could have been let off as leniently. How did Henry of Huntington know that the Archbishop was sent to his grave by judgment of God for consecrating Stephen? He does not explain. Neither does he explain why Stephen was awarded a pleasanter death than he was entitled to, while the aged King Henry, his predecessor, who had ruled England thirty-five years to the people's strongly worded satisfaction, was condemned to close his life in circumstances most distinctly unpleasant, inconvenient, and disagreeable. His was probably the most uninspiring funeral that is set down in history. There is not a detail about it that is attractive. It seems to have been just the funeral for Stephen, and even at this far-distant day it is matter of just regret that by an indiscretion the wrong man got it.", "28": "Whenever God punishes a man, Henry of Huntington knows why it was done, and tells us; and his pen is eloquent with admiration; but when a man has earned punishment, and escapes, he does not explain. He is evidently puzzled, but he does not say anything. I think it is often apparent that he is pained by these discrepancies, but loyally tries his best not to show it.

However, he has plenty of opportunities to feel contented with the way things go\u2014his book is full of them.", "29": "King David of Scotland... under color of religion caused his followers to deal most barbarously with the English. They ripped open women, tossed children on the points of spears, butchered priests at the altars, and, cutting off the heads from the images on crucifixes, placed them on the bodies of the slain, while in exchange they fixed on the crucifixes the heads of their victims. Wherever the Scots came, there was the same scene of horror and cruelty: women shrieking, old men lamenting, amid the groans of the dying and the despair of the living.", "30": "But the English got the victory.", "31": "Then the chief of the men of Lothian fell, pierced by an arrow, and all his followers were put to flight.

No, for that was the common custom on both sides, and not open to criticism. Then was it for doing the butcheries \u201cunder cover of religion\u201d? No, that was not it; religious feeling was often expressed in that fervent way all through those old centuries. The truth is, He was not offended at \u201cthem\u201d at all; He was only offended at their king, who had been false to an oath. Then why did not He put the punishment upon the king instead of upon \u201cthem\u201d? It is a difficult question. One can see by the Chronicle that the \u201cjudgments\u201d fell rather customarily upon the wrong person, but Henry of Huntington does not explain why. Here is one that went true; the chronicler's satisfaction in it is not hidden:", "33": "In the month of August, Providence displayed its justice in a remarkable manner; for two of the nobles who had converted monasteries into fortifications, expelling the monks, their sin being the same, met with a similar punishment. Robert Marmion was one, Godfrey de Mandeville the other. Robert Marmion, issuing forth against the enemy, was slain under the walls of the monastery, being the only one who fell, though he was surrounded by his troops. Dying excommunicated, he became subject to death everlasting. In like manner Earl Godfrey was singled out among his followers, and shot with an arrow by a common foot-soldier. He made light of the wound, but he died of it in a few days, under excommunication. See here the like judgment of God, memorable through all ages!", "34": "This exaltation jars upon me; not because of the death of the men, for they deserved that, but because it is death eternal, in white-hot fire and flame. It makes my flesh crawl. I have not known more than three men, or perhaps four, in my whole lifetime, whom I would rejoice to see writhing in those fires for even a year, let alone forever. I believe I would relent before the year was up, and get them out if I could. I think that in the long run, if a man's wife and babies, who had not harmed me, should come crying and pleading, I couldn't stand it; I know I should forgive him and let him go, even if he had violated a monastery. Henry of Huntington has been watching Godfrey and Marmion for nearly seven hundred and fifty years, now, but I couldn't do it, I know I couldn't. I am soft and gentle in my nature, and I should have forgiven them seventy-and-seven times, long ago. And I think God has; but this is only an opinion, and not authoritative, like Henry of Huntington's interpretations. I could learn to interpret, but I have never tried; I get so little time.", "35": "All through his book Henry exhibits his familiarity with the intentions of God, and with the reasons for his intentions. Sometimes\u2014very often, in fact\u2014the act follows the intention after such a wide interval of time that one wonders how Henry could fit one act out of a hundred to one intention out of a hundred and get the thing right every time when there was such abundant choice among acts and intentions. Sometimes a man offends the Deity with a crime, and is punished for it thirty years later; meantime he has committed a million other crimes: no matter, Henry can pick out the one that brought the worms. Worms were generally used in those days for the slaying of particularly wicked people. This has gone out, now, but in old times it was a favorite. It always indicated a case of \u201cwrath.\u201d For instance:", "36": "... the just God avenging Robert Fitzhilderbrand's perfidy, a worm grew in his vitals, which gradually gnawing its way through his intestines fattened on the abandoned man till, tortured with excruciating sufferings and venting himself in bitter moans, he was by a fitting punishment brought to his end.\u2014(P. 400.)", "37": "It was probably an alligator, but we cannot tell; we only know it was a particular breed, and only used to convey wrath. Some authorities think it was an ichthyosaurus, but there is much doubt.", "38": "However, one thing we do know; and that is that that worm had been due years and years. Robert F. had violated a monastery once; he had committed unprintable crimes since, and they had been permitted\u2014under disapproval\u2014but the ravishment of the monastery had not been forgotten nor forgiven, and the worm came at last.", "39": "Why were these reforms put off in this strange way? What was to be gained by it? Did Henry of Huntington really know his facts, or was he only guessing? Sometimes I am half persuaded that he is only a guesser, and not a good one. The divine wisdom must surely be of the better quality than he makes it out to be.", "40": "Five hundred years before Henry's time some forecasts of the Lord's purposes were furnished by a pope, who perceived, by certain perfectly trustworthy signs furnished by the Deity for the information of His familiars, that the end of the world was", "41": "... about to come. But as this end of the world draws near many things are at hand which have not before happened, as changes in the air, terrible signs in the heavens, tempests out of the common order of the seasons, wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes in various places; all which will not happen in our days, but after our days all will come to pass.", "42": "Still, the end was so near that these signs were \u201csent before that we may be careful for our souls and be found prepared to meet the impending judgment.\u201d", "43": "That was thirteen hundred years ago. This is really no improvement on the work of the Roman augurs."}, "CONCERNING TOBACCO": {"0": "(Written about 1893; not before published)", "1": "As concerns tobacco, there are many superstitions. And the chiefest is this\u2014that there is a standard governing the matter, whereas there is nothing of the kind. Each man's own preference is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept, the only one which can command him. A congress of all the tobacco-lovers in the world could not elect a standard which would be binding upon you or me, or would even much influence us.", "2": "The next superstition is that a man has a standard of his own. He hasn't. He thinks he has, but he hasn't. He thinks he can tell what he regards as a good cigar from what he regards as a bad one\u2014but he can't. He goes by the brand, yet imagines he goes by the flavor. One may palm off the worst counterfeit upon him; if it bears his brand he will smoke it contentedly and never suspect.", "3": "Children of twenty-five, who have seven years of experience, try to tell me what is a good cigar and what isn't. Me, who never learned to smoke, but always smoked; me, who came into the world asking for a light.", "4": "No one can tell me what is a good cigar\u2014for me. I am the only judge. People who claim to know say that I smoke the worst cigars in the world. They bring their own cigars when they come to my house. They betray an unmanly terror when I offer them a cigar; they tell lies and hurry away to meet engagements which they have not made when they are threatened with the hospitalities of my box. Now then, observe what superstition, assisted by a man's reputation, can do. I was to have twelve personal friends to supper one night. One of them was as notorious for costly and elegant cigars as I was for cheap and devilish ones. I called at his house and when no one was looking borrowed a double handful of his very choicest; cigars which cost him forty cents apiece and bore red-and-gold labels in sign of their nobility. I removed the labels and put the cigars into a box with my favorite brand on it\u2014a brand which those people all knew, and which cowed them as men are cowed by an epidemic. They took these cigars when offered at the end of the supper, and lit them and sternly struggled with them\u2014in dreary silence, for hilarity died when the fell brand came into view and started around\u2014but their fortitude held for a short time only; then they made excuses and filed out, treading on one another's heels with indecent eagerness; and in the morning when I went out to observe results the cigars lay all between the front door and the gate. All except one\u2014that one lay in the plate of the man from whom I had cabbaged the lot. One or two whiffs was all he could stand. He told me afterward that some day I would get shot for giving people that kind of cigars to smoke.", "5": "Am I certain of my own standard? Perfectly; yes, absolutely\u2014unless somebody fools me by putting my brand on some other kind of cigar; for no doubt I am like the rest, and know my cigar by the brand instead of by the flavor. However, my standard is a pretty wide one and covers a good deal of territory. To me, almost any cigar is good that nobody else will smoke, and to me almost all cigars are bad that other people consider good. Nearly any cigar will do me, except a Havana. People think they hurt my feelings when they come to my house with their life preservers on\u2014I mean, with their own cigars in their pockets. It is an error; I take care of myself in a similar way. When I go into danger\u2014that is, into rich people's houses, where, in the nature of things, they will have high-tariff cigars, red-and-gilt girded and nested in a rosewood box along with a damp sponge, cigars which develop a dismal black ash and burn down the side and smell, and will grow hot to the fingers, and will go on growing hotter and hotter, and go on smelling more and more infamously and unendurably the deeper the fire tunnels down inside below the thimbleful of honest tobacco that is in the front end, the furnisher of it praising it all the time and telling you how much the deadly thing cost\u2014yes, when I go into that sort of peril I carry my own defense along; I carry my own brand\u2014twenty-seven cents a barrel\u2014and I live to see my family again. I may seem to light his red-gartered cigar, but that is only for courtesy's sake; I smuggle it into my pocket for the poor, of whom I know many, and light one of my own; and while he praises it I join in, but when he says it cost forty-five cents I say nothing, for I know better.", "6": "However, to say true, my tastes are so catholic that I have never seen any cigars that I really could not smoke, except those that cost a dollar apiece. I have examined those and know that they are made of dog-hair, and not good dog-hair at that.", "7": "I have a thoroughly satisfactory time in Europe, for all over the Continent one finds cigars which not even the most hardened newsboys in New York would smoke. I brought cigars with me, the last time; I will not do that any more. In Italy, as in France, the Government is the only cigar-peddler. Italy has three or four domestic brands: the Minghetti, the Trabuco, the Virginia, and a very coarse one which is a modification of the Virginia. The Minghettis are large and comely, and cost three dollars and sixty cents a hundred; I can smoke a hundred in seven days and enjoy every one of them. The Trabucos suit me, too; I don't remember the price. But one has to learn to like the Virginia, nobody is born friendly to it. It looks like a rat-tail file, but smokes better, some think. It has a straw through it; you pull this out, and it leaves a flue, otherwise there would be no draught, not even as much as there is to a nail. Some prefer a nail at first. However, I like all the French, Swiss, German, and Italian domestic cigars, and have never cared to inquire what they are made of; and nobody would know, anyhow, perhaps. There is even a brand of European smoking-tobacco that I like. It is a brand used by the Italian peasants. It is loose and dry and black, and looks like tea-grounds. When the fire is applied it expands, and climbs up and towers above the pipe, and presently tumbles off inside of one's vest. The tobacco itself is cheap, but it raises the insurance. It is as I remarked in the beginning\u2014the taste for tobacco is a matter of superstition. There are no standards\u2014no real standards. Each man's preference is the only standard for him, the only one which he can accept, the only one which can command him."}, "THE BEE": {"0": "It was Maeterlinck who introduced me to the bee. I mean, in the psychical and in the poetical way. I had had a business introduction earlier. It was when I was a boy. It is strange that I should remember a formality like that so long; it must be nearly sixty years.", "1": "Bee scientists always speak of the bee as she. It is because all the important bees are of that sex. In the hive there is one married bee, called the queen; she has fifty thousand children; of these, about one hundred are sons; the rest are daughters. Some of the daughters are young maids, some are old maids, and all are virgins and remain so.", "2": "Every spring the queen comes out of the hive and flies away with one of her sons and marries him. The honeymoon lasts only an hour or two; then the queen divorces her husband and returns home competent to lay two million eggs. This will be enough to last the year, but not more than enough, because hundreds of bees get drowned every day, and other hundreds are eaten by birds, and it is the queen's business to keep the population up to standard\u2014say, fifty thousand. She must always have that many children on hand and efficient during the busy season, which is summer, or winter would catch the community short of food. She lays from two thousand to three thousand eggs a day, according to the demand; and she must exercise judgment, and not lay more than are needed in a slim flower-harvest, nor fewer than are required in a prodigal one, or the board of directors will dethrone her and elect a queen that has more sense.", "3": "There are always a few royal heirs in stock and ready to take her place\u2014ready and more than anxious to do it, although she is their own mother. These girls are kept by themselves, and are regally fed and tended from birth. No other bees get such fine food as they get, or live such a high and luxurious life. By consequence they are larger and longer and sleeker than their working sisters. And they have a curved sting, shaped like a scimitar, while the others have a straight one.", "4": "A common bee will sting any one or anybody, but a royalty stings royalties only. A common bee will sting and kill another common bee, for cause, but when it is necessary to kill the queen other ways are employed. When a queen has grown old and slack and does not lay eggs enough one of her royal daughters is allowed to come to attack her, the rest of the bees looking on at the duel and seeing fair play. It is a duel with the curved stings. If one of the fighters gets hard pressed and gives it up and runs, she is brought back and must try again\u2014once, maybe twice; then, if she runs yet once more for her life, judicial death is her portion; her children pack themselves into a ball around her person and hold her in that compact grip two or three days, until she starves to death or is suffocated. Meantime the victor bee is receiving royal honors and performing the one royal function\u2014laying eggs.", "5": "As regards the ethics of the judicial assassination of the queen, that is a matter of politics, and will be discussed later, in its proper place.", "6": "During substantially the whole of her short life of five or six years the queen lives in the Egyptian darkness and stately seclusion of the royal apartments, with none about her but plebeian servants, who give her empty lip-affection in place of the love which her heart hungers for; who spy upon her in the interest of her waiting heirs, and report and exaggerate her defects and deficiencies to them; who fawn upon her and flatter her to her face and slander her behind her back; who grovel before her in the day of her power and forsake her in her age and weakness. There she sits, friendless, upon her throne through the long night of her life, cut off from the consoling sympathies and sweet companionship and loving endearments which she craves, by the gilded barriers of her awful rank; a forlorn exile in her own house and home, weary object of formal ceremonies and machine-made worship, winged child of the sun, native to the free air and the blue skies and the flowery fields, doomed by the splendid accident of her birth to trade this priceless heritage for a black captivity, a tinsel grandeur, and a loveless life, with shame and insult at the end and a cruel death\u2014and condemned by the human instinct in her to hold the bargain valuable!", "7": "Huber, Lubbock, Maeterlinck\u2014in fact, all the great authorities\u2014are agreed in denying that the bee is a member of the human family. I do not know why they have done this, but I think it is from dishonest motives. Why, the innumerable facts brought to light by their own painstaking and exhaustive experiments prove that if there is a master fool in the world, it is the bee. That seems to settle it.", "8": "But that is the way of the scientist. He will spend thirty years in building up a mountain range of facts with the intent to prove a certain theory; then he is so happy in his achievement that as a rule he overlooks the main chief fact of all\u2014that his accumulation proves an entirely different thing. When you point out this miscarriage to him he does not answer your letters; when you call to convince him, the servant prevaricates and you do not get in. Scientists have odious manners, except when you prop up their theory; then you can borrow money of them.", "9": "To be strictly fair, I will concede that now and then one of them will answer your letter, but when they do they avoid the issue\u2014you cannot pin them down. When I discovered that the bee was human I wrote about it to all those scientists whom I have just mentioned. For evasions, I have seen nothing to equal the answers I got.", "10": "After the queen, the personage next in importance in the hive is the virgin. The virgins are fifty thousand or one hundred thousand in number, and they are the workers, the laborers. No work is done, in the hive or out of it, save by them. The males do not work, the queen does no work, unless laying eggs is work, but it does not seem so to me. There are only two million of them, anyway, and all of five months to finish the contract in. The distribution of work in a hive is as cleverly and elaborately specialized as it is in a vast American machine-shop or factory. A bee that has been trained to one of the many and various industries of the concern doesn't know how to exercise any other, and would be offended if asked to take a hand in anything outside of her profession. She is as human as a cook; and if you should ask the cook to wait on the table, you know what would happen. Cooks will play the piano if you like, but they draw the line there. In my time I have asked a cook to chop wood, and I know about these things. Even the hired girl has her frontiers; true, they are vague, they are ill-defined, even flexible, but they are there. This is not conjecture; it is founded on the absolute. And then the butler. You ask the butler to wash the dog. It is just as I say; there is much to be learned in these ways, without going to books. Books are very well, but books do not cover the whole domain of esthetic human culture. Pride of profession is one of the boniest bones in existence, if not the boniest. Without doubt it is so in the hive."}, "TAMING THE BICYCLE": {"0": "(Written about 1893; not before published)", "1": "In the early eighties Mark Twain learned to ride one of the old high-wheel bicycles of that period. He wrote an account of his experience, but did not offer it for publication. The form of bicycle he rode long ago became antiquated, but in the humor of his pleasantry is a quality which does not grow old.", "2": "A. B. P. I", "3": "I thought the matter over, and concluded I could do it. So I went down and bought a barrel of Pond's Extract and a bicycle. The Expert came home with me to instruct me. We chose the back yard, for the sake of privacy, and went to work.", "4": "Mine was not a full-grown bicycle, but only a colt\u2014a fifty-inch, with the pedals shortened up to forty-eight\u2014and skittish, like any other colt. The Expert explained the thing's points briefly, then he got on its back and rode around a little, to show me how easy it was to do. He said that the dismounting was perhaps the hardest thing to learn, and so we would leave that to the last. But he was in error there. He found, to his surprise and joy, that all that he needed to do was to get me on to the machine and stand out of the way; I could get off, myself. Although I was wholly inexperienced, I dismounted in the best time on record. He was on that side, shoving up the machine; we all came down with a crash, he at the bottom, I next, and the machine on top.", "5": "We examined the machine, but it was not in the least injured. This was hardly believable. Yet the Expert assured me that it was true; in fact, the examination proved it. I was partly to realize, then, how admirably these things are constructed. We applied some Pond's Extract, and resumed. The Expert got on the other side to shove up this time, but I dismounted on that side; so the result was as before.", "6": "The machine was not hurt. We oiled ourselves up again, and resumed. This time the Expert took up a sheltered position behind, but somehow or other we landed on him again.", "7": "He was full of surprised admiration; said it was abnormal. She was all right, not a scratch on her, not a timber started anywhere. I said it was wonderful, while we were greasing up, but he said that when I came to know these steel spider-webs I would realize that nothing but dynamite could cripple them. Then he limped out to position, and we resumed once more. This time the Expert took up the position of short-stop, and got a man to shove up behind. We got up a handsome speed, and presently traversed a brick, and I went out over the top of the tiller and landed, head down, on the instructor's back, and saw the machine fluttering in the air between me and the sun. It was well it came down on us, for that broke the fall, and it was not injured.", "8": "Five days later I got out and was carried down to the hospital, and found the Expert doing pretty fairly. In a few more days I was quite sound. I attribute this to my prudence in always dismounting on something soft. Some recommend a feather bed, but I think an Expert is better.", "9": "The Expert got out at last, brought four assistants with him. It was a good idea. These four held the graceful cobweb upright while I climbed into the saddle; then they formed in column and marched on either side of me while the Expert pushed behind; all hands assisted at the dismount.", "10": "The bicycle had what is called the \u201cwabbles,\u201d and had them very badly. In order to keep my position, a good many things were required of me, and in every instance the thing required was against nature. Against nature, but not against the laws of nature. That is to say, that whatever the needed thing might be, my nature, habit, and breeding moved me to attempt it in one way, while some immutable and unsuspected law of physics required that it be done in just the other way. I perceived by this how radically and grotesquely wrong had been the life-long education of my body and members. They were steeped in ignorance; they knew nothing\u2014nothing which it could profit them to know. For instance, if I found myself falling to the right, I put the tiller hard down the other way, by a quite natural impulse, and so violated a law, and kept on going down. The law required the opposite thing\u2014the big wheel must be turned in the direction in which you are falling. It is hard to believe this, when you are told it. And not merely hard to believe it, but impossible; it is opposed to all your notions. And it is just as hard to do it, after you do come to believe it. Believing it, and knowing by the most convincing proof that it is true, does not help it: you can't any more DO it than you could before; you can neither force nor persuade yourself to do it at first. The intellect has to come to the front, now. It has to teach the limbs to discard their old education and adopt the new.", "11": "The steps of one's progress are distinctly marked. At the end of each lesson he knows he has acquired something, and he also knows what that something is, and likewise that it will stay with him. It is not like studying German, where you mull along, in a groping, uncertain way, for thirty years; and at last, just as you think you've got it, they spring the subjunctive on you, and there you are. No\u2014and I see now, plainly enough, that the great pity about the German language is, that you can't fall off it and hurt yourself. There is nothing like that feature to make you attend strictly to business. But I also see, by what I have learned of bicycling, that the right and only sure way to learn German is by the bicycling method. That is to say, take a grip on one villainy of it at a time, and learn it\u2014not ease up and shirk to the next, leaving that one half learned.", "12": "When you have reached the point in bicycling where you can balance the machine tolerably fairly and propel it and steer it, then comes your next task\u2014how to mount it. You do it in this way: you hop along behind it on your right foot, resting the other on the mounting-peg, and grasping the tiller with your hands. At the word, you rise on the peg, stiffen your left leg, hang your other one around in the air in a general in indefinite way, lean your stomach against the rear of the saddle, and then fall off, maybe on one side, maybe on the other; but you fall off. You get up and do it again; and once more; and then several times.", "13": "By this time you have learned to keep your balance; and also to steer without wrenching the tiller out by the roots (I say tiller because it IS a tiller; \u201chandle-bar\u201d is a lamely descriptive phrase). So you steer along, straight ahead, a little while, then you rise forward, with a steady strain, bringing your right leg, and then your body, into the saddle, catch your breath, fetch a violent hitch this way and then that, and down you go again.", "14": "But you have ceased to mind the going down by this time; you are getting to light on one foot or the other with considerable certainty. Six more attempts and six more falls make you perfect. You land in the saddle comfortably, next time, and stay there\u2014that is, if you can be content to let your legs dangle, and leave the pedals alone a while; but if you grab at once for the pedals, you are gone again. You soon learn to wait a little and perfect your balance before reaching for the pedals; then the mounting-art is acquired, is complete, and a little practice will make it simple and easy to you, though spectators ought to keep off a rod or two to one side, along at first, if you have nothing against them.", "15": "And now you come to the voluntary dismount; you learned the other kind first of all. It is quite easy to tell one how to do the voluntary dismount; the words are few, the requirement simple, and apparently undifficult; let your left pedal go down till your left leg is nearly straight, turn your wheel to the left, and get off as you would from a horse. It certainly does sound exceedingly easy; but it isn't. I don't know why it isn't but it isn't. Try as you may, you don't get down as you would from a horse, you get down as you would from a house afire. You make a spectacle of yourself every time.", "16": "II", "17": "During the eight days I took a daily lesson of an hour and a half. At the end of this twelve working-hours' apprenticeship I was graduated\u2014in the rough. I was pronounced competent to paddle my own bicycle without outside help. It seems incredible, this celerity of acquirement. It takes considerably longer than that to learn horseback-riding in the rough.", "18": "Now it is true that I could have learned without a teacher, but it would have been risky for me, because of my natural clumsiness. The self-taught man seldom knows anything accurately, and he does not know a tenth as much as he could have known if he had worked under teachers; and, besides, he brags, and is the means of fooling other thoughtless people into going and doing as he himself has done. There are those who imagine that the unlucky accidents of life\u2014life's \u201cexperiences\u201d\u2014are in some way useful to us. I wish I could find out how. I never knew one of them to happen twice. They always change off and swap around and catch you on your inexperienced side. If personal experience can be worth anything as an education, it wouldn't seem likely that you could trip Methuselah; and yet if that old person could come back here it is more than likely that one of the first things he would do would be to take hold of one of these electric wires and tie himself all up in a knot. Now the surer thing and the wiser thing would be for him to ask somebody whether it was a good thing to take hold of. But that would not suit him; he would be one of the self-taught kind that go by experience; he would want to examine for himself. And he would find, for his instruction, that the coiled patriarch shuns the electric wire; and it would be useful to him, too, and would leave his education in quite a complete and rounded-out condition, till he should come again, some day, and go to bouncing a dynamite-can around to find out what was in it.", "19": "But we wander from the point. However, get a teacher; it saves much time and Pond's Extract.", "20": "Before taking final leave of me, my instructor inquired concerning my physical strength, and I was able to inform him that I hadn't any. He said that that was a defect which would make up-hill wheeling pretty difficult for me at first; but he also said the bicycle would soon remove it. The contrast between his muscles and mine was quite marked. He wanted to test mine, so I offered my biceps\u2014which was my best. It almost made him smile. He said, \u201cIt is pulpy, and soft, and yielding, and rounded; it evades pressure, and glides from under the fingers; in the dark a body might think it was an oyster in a rag.\u201d Perhaps this made me look grieved, for he added, briskly: \u201cOh, that's all right, you needn't worry about that; in a little while you can't tell it from a petrified kidney. Just go right along with your practice; you're all right.\u201d", "21": "Then he left me, and I started out alone to seek adventures. You don't really have to seek them\u2014that is nothing but a phrase\u2014they come to you.", "22": "I chose a reposeful Sabbath-day sort of a back street which was about thirty yards wide between the curbstones. I knew it was not wide enough; still, I thought that by keeping strict watch and wasting no space unnecessarily I could crowd through.", "23": "Of course I had trouble mounting the machine, entirely on my own responsibility, with no encouraging moral support from the outside, no sympathetic instructor to say, \u201cGood! now you're doing well\u2014good again\u2014don't hurry\u2014there, now, you're all right\u2014brace up, go ahead.\u201d In place of this I had some other support. This was a boy, who was perched on a gate-post munching a hunk of maple sugar.", "24": "He was full of interest and comment. The first time I failed and went down he said that if he was me he would dress up in pillows, that's what he would do. The next time I went down he advised me to go and learn to ride a tricycle first. The third time I collapsed he said he didn't believe I could stay on a horse-car. But the next time I succeeded, and got clumsily under way in a weaving, tottering, uncertain fashion, and occupying pretty much all of the street. My slow and lumbering gait filled the boy to the chin with scorn, and he sung out, \u201cMy, but don't he rip along!\u201d Then he got down from his post and loafed along the sidewalk, still observing and occasionally commenting. Presently he dropped into my wake and followed along behind. A little girl passed by, balancing a wash-board on her head, and giggled, and seemed about to make a remark, but the boy said, rebukingly, \u201cLet him alone, he's going to a funeral.\u201d", "25": "I have been familiar with that street for years, and had always supposed it was a dead level; but it was not, as the bicycle now informed me, to my surprise. The bicycle, in the hands of a novice, is as alert and acute as a spirit-level in the detecting of delicate and vanishing shades of difference in these matters. It notices a rise where your untrained eye would not observe that one existed; it notices any decline which water will run down. I was toiling up a slight rise, but was not aware of it. It made me tug and pant and perspire; and still, labor as I might, the machine came almost to a standstill every little while. At such times the boy would say: \u201cThat's it! take a rest\u2014there ain't no hurry. They can't hold the funeral without YOU.\u201d", "26": "Stones were a bother to me. Even the smallest ones gave me a panic when I went over them. I could hit any kind of a stone, no matter how small, if I tried to miss it; and of course at first I couldn't help trying to do that. It is but natural. It is part of the ass that is put in us all, for some inscrutable reason.", "27": "I was at the end of my course, at last, and it was necessary for me to round to. This is not a pleasant thing, when you undertake it for the first time on your own responsibility, and neither is it likely to succeed. Your confidence oozes away, you fill steadily up with nameless apprehensions, every fiber of you is tense with a watchful strain, you start a cautious and gradual curve, but your squirmy nerves are all full of electric anxieties, so the curve is quickly demoralized into a jerky and perilous zigzag; then suddenly the nickel-clad horse takes the bit in its mouth and goes slanting for the curbstone, defying all prayers and all your powers to change its mind\u2014your heart stands still, your breath hangs fire, your legs forget to work, straight on you go, and there are but a couple of feet between you and the curb now. And now is the desperate moment, the last chance to save yourself; of course all your instructions fly out of your head, and you whirl your wheel AWAY from the curb instead of TOWARD it, and so you go sprawling on that granite-bound inhospitable shore. That was my luck; that was my experience. I dragged myself out from under the indestructible bicycle and sat down on the curb to examine.", "28": "I started on the return trip. It was now that I saw a farmer's wagon poking along down toward me, loaded with cabbages. If I needed anything to perfect the precariousness of my steering, it was just that. The farmer was occupying the middle of the road with his wagon, leaving barely fourteen or fifteen yards of space on either side. I couldn't shout at him\u2014a beginner can't shout; if he opens his mouth he is gone; he must keep all his attention on his business. But in this grisly emergency, the boy came to the rescue, and for once I had to be grateful to him. He kept a sharp lookout on the swiftly varying impulses and inspirations of my bicycle, and shouted to the man accordingly:", "29": "\u201cTo the left! Turn to the left, or this jackass 'll run over you!\u201d The man started to do it. \u201cNo, to the right, to the right! Hold on! THAT won't do!\u2014to the left!\u2014to the right!\u2014to the LEFT\u2014right! left\u2014ri\u2014Stay where you ARE, or you're a goner!\u201d", "30": "And just then I caught the off horse in the starboard and went down in a pile. I said, \u201cHang it! Couldn't you SEE I was coming?\u201d", "31": "\u201cYes, I see you was coming, but I couldn't tell which WAY you was coming. Nobody could\u2014now, could they? You couldn't yourself\u2014now, could you? So what could I do?\u201d", "32": "There was something in that, and so I had the magnanimity to say so. I said I was no doubt as much to blame as he was.", "33": "Within the next five days I achieved so much progress that the boy couldn't keep up with me. He had to go back to his gate-post, and content himself with watching me fall at long range.", "34": "There was a row of low stepping-stones across one end of the street, a measured yard apart. Even after I got so I could steer pretty fairly I was so afraid of those stones that I always hit them. They gave me the worst falls I ever got in that street, except those which I got from dogs. I have seen it stated that no expert is quick enough to run over a dog; that a dog is always able to skip out of his way. I think that that may be true: but I think that the reason he couldn't run over the dog was because he was trying to. I did not try to run over any dog. But I ran over every dog that came along. I think it makes a great deal of difference. If you try to run over the dog he knows how to calculate, but if you are trying to miss him he does not know how to calculate, and is liable to jump the wrong way every time. It was always so in my experience. Even when I could not hit a wagon I could hit a dog that came to see me practice. They all liked to see me practice, and they all came, for there was very little going on in our neighborhood to entertain a dog. It took time to learn to miss a dog, but I achieved even that.", "35": "I can steer as well as I want to, now, and I will catch that boy out one of these days and run over HIM if he doesn't reform.", "36": "Get a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live."}, "IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?": {"0": "Scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript which constitute this formidable Autobiography and Diary of mine, certain chapters will in some distant future be found which deal with \"Claimants\"\u2014claimants historically notorious: Satan, Claimant; the Golden Calf, Claimant; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, Claimant; Louis XVII., Claimant; William Shakespeare, Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant; Mary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant\u2014and the rest of them. Eminent Claimants, successful Claimants, defeated Claimants, royal Claimants, pleb Claimants, showy Claimants, shabby Claimants, revered Claimants, despised Claimants, twinkle star-like here and there and yonder through the mists of history and legend and tradition\u2014and, oh, all the darling tribe are clothed in mystery and romance, and we read about them with deep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous resentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to. It has always been so with the human race. There was never a Claimant that couldn't get a hearing, nor one that couldn't accumulate a rapturous following, no matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be. Arthur Orton's claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet come to life again was as flimsy as Mrs. Eddy's that she wrote Science And Health from the direct dictation of the Deity; yet in England nearly forty years ago Orton had a huge army of devotees and incorrigible adherents, many of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had been proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer, and today Mrs. Eddy's following is not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers and enthusiasm. Orton had many fine and educated minds among his adherents, Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning. Her Church is as well equipped in those particulars as is any other Church. Claimants can always count upon a following, it doesn't matter who they are, nor what they claim, nor whether they come with documents or without. It was always so. Down out of the long-vanished past, across the abyss of the ages, if you listen, you can still hear the believing multitudes shouting for Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel.", "1": "A friend has sent me a new book, from England\u2014The Shakespeare Problem Restated\u2014well restated and closely reasoned; and my fifty years' interest in that matter\u2014asleep for the last three years\u2014is excited once more. It is an interest which was born of Delia Bacon's book\u2014away back in that ancient day\u20141857, or maybe 1856. About a year later my pilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from his own steamboat to the Pennsylvania, and placed me under the orders and instructions of George Ealer\u2014dead now, these many, many years. I steered for him a good many months\u2014as was the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice: stood a daylight watch and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and correction of the master. He was a prime chess-player and an idolater of Shakespeare. He would play chess with anybody; even with me, and it cost his official dignity something to do that. Also\u2014quite uninvited\u2014he would read Shakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when it was his watch and I was steering. He read well, but not profitably for me, because he constantly injected commands into the text. That broke it all up, mixed it all up, tangled it all up\u2014to that degree, in fact, that if we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an ignorant person couldn't have told, sometimes, which observations were Shakespeare's and which were Ealer's. For instance:", "2": "He certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and stormy and tragic, but it was a damage to me, because I have never since been able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way. I cannot rid it of his explosive interlardings, they break in everywhere with their irrelevant, \"What in hell are you up to now! pull her down! more! More!\u2014there now, steady as you go,\" and the other disorganizing interruptions that were always leaping from his mouth. When I read Shakespeare now I can hear them as plainly as I did in that long-departed time\u2014fifty-one years ago. I never regarded Ealer's readings as educational. Indeed, they were a detriment to me.", "3": "His contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring that detail he was a good reader; I can say that much for him. He did not use the book, and did not need to; he knew his Shakespeare as well as Euclid ever knew his multiplication table.", "4": "Did he have something to say\u2014this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippi pilot\u2014anent Delia Bacon's book?", "5": "Yes. And he said it; said it all the time, for months\u2014in the morning watch, the middle watch, and dog watch; and probably kept it going in his sleep. He bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it appeared, and we discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of river four times traversed in every thirty-five days\u2014the time required by that swift boat to achieve two round trips. We discussed, and discussed, and discussed, and disputed and disputed and disputed; at any rate, he did, and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog and there was a vacancy. He did his arguing with heat, with energy, with violence; and I did mine with the reserve and moderation of a subordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house that is perched forty feet above the water. He was fiercely loyal to Shakespeare and cordially scornful of Bacon and of all the pretensions of the Baconians. So was I\u2014at first. And at first he was glad that that was my attitude. There were even indications that he admired it; indications dimmed, it is true, by the distance that lay between the lofty boss-pilotical altitude and my lowly one, yet perceptible to me; perceptible, and translatable into a compliment\u2014compliment coming down from above the snow-line and not well thawed in the transit, and not likely to set anything afire, not even a cub-pilot's self-conceit; still a detectable complement, and precious.", "6": "Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare\u2014if possible\u2014than I was before, and more prejudiced against Bacon\u2014if possible\u2014than I was before. And so we discussed and discussed, both on the same side, and were happy. For a while. Only for a while. Only for a very little while, a very, very, very little while. Then the atmosphere began to change; began to cool off.", "7": "A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was, earlier than I did, perhaps, but I saw it early enough for all practical purposes. You see, he was of an argumentative disposition. Therefore it took him but a little time to get tired of arguing with a person who agreed with everything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative to flare up and show what he could do when it came to clear, cold, hard, rose-cut, hundred-faceted, diamond-flashing reasoning. That was his name for it. It has been applied since, with complacency, as many as several times, in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle. On the Shakespeare side.", "8": "Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me when principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to each other and a choice had to be made: I let principle go, and went over to the other side. Not the entire way, but far enough to answer the requirements of the case. That is to say, I took this attitude\u2014to wit, I only believed Bacon wrote Shakespeare, whereas I knew Shakespeare didn't. Ealer was satisfied with that, and the war broke loose. Study, practice, experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled me to take my new position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterly seriously; a little later still, lovingly, gratefully, devotedly; finally: fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly. After that I was welded to my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and I looked down with compassion not unmixed with scorn upon everybody else's faith that didn't tally with mine. That faith, imposed upon me by self-interest in that ancient day, remains my faith today, and in it I find comfort, solace, peace, and never-failing joy. You see how curiously theological it is. The \"rice Christian\" of the Orient goes through the very same steps, when he is after rice and the missionary is after him; he goes for rice, and remains to worship.", "9": "Ealer did a lot of our \"reasoning\"\u2014not to say substantially all of it. The slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by that large name. We others do not call our inductions and deductions and reductions by any name at all. They show for themselves what they are, and we can with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of its own choosing.", "10": "Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled my induction-talents together and hove the controversial lead myself: always getting eight feet, eight and a half, often nine, sometimes even quarter-less-twain\u2014as I believed; but always \"no bottom,\" as he said.", "11": "I got the best of him only once. I prepared myself. I wrote out a passage from Shakespeare\u2014it may have been the very one I quoted awhile ago, I don't remember\u2014and riddled it with his wild steamboatful interlardings. When an unrisky opportunity offered, one lovely summer day, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of crossings known as Hell's Half Acre, and were aboard again and he had sneaked the Pennsylvania triumphantly through it without once scraping sand, and the A. T. Lacey had followed in our wake and got stuck, and he was feeling good, I showed it to him. It amused him. I asked him to fire it off\u2014read it; read it, I diplomatically added, as only he could read dramatic poetry. The compliment touched him where he lived. He did read it; read it with surpassing fire and spirit; read it as it will never be read again; for he knew how to put the right music into those thunderous interlardings and make them seem a part of the text, make them sound as if they were bursting from Shakespeare's own soul, each one of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed and magnificent whole.", "12": "I waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer; waited until he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet position, my pet argument, the one which I was fondest of, the one which I prized far above all others in my ammunition-wagon\u2014to wit, that Shakespeare couldn't have written Shakespeare's works, for the reason that the man who wrote them was limitlessly familiar with the laws, and the law-courts, and law-proceedings, and lawyer-talk, and lawyer-ways\u2014and if Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely divided star-dust that constituted this vast wealth, how did he get it, and where and when?", "13": "\"From books.\"", "14": "From books! That was always the idea. I answered as my readings of the champions of my side of the great controversy had taught me to answer: that a man can't handle glibly and easily and comfortably and successfully the argot of a trade at which he has not personally served. He will make mistakes; he will not, and cannot, get the trade-phrasings precisely and exactly right; and the moment he departs, by even a shade, from a common trade-form, the reader who has served that trade will know the writer hasn't. Ealer would not be convinced; he said a man could learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and free-masonries of any trade by careful reading and studying. But when I got him to read again the passage from Shakespeare with the interlardings, he perceived, himself, that books couldn't teach a student a bewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and perfectly that he could talk them off in book and play or conversation and make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover. It was a triumph for me. He was silent awhile, and I knew what was happening\u2014he was losing his temper. And I knew he would presently close the session with the same old argument that was always his stay and his support in time of need; the same old argument, the one I couldn't answer, because I dasn't\u2014the argument that I was an ass, and better shut up. He delivered it, and I obeyed.", "15": "O dear, how long ago it was\u2014how pathetically long ago! And here am I, old, forsaken, forlorn, and alone, arranging to get that argument out of somebody again.", "16": "When a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without saying that he keeps company with other standard authors. Ealer always had several high-class books in the pilot-house, and he read the same ones over and over again, and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones. He played well on the flute, and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play. So did I. He had a notion that a flute would keep its health better if you took it apart when it was not standing a watch; and so, when it was not on duty it took its rest, disjointed, on the compass-shelf under the breastboard. When the Pennsylvania blew up and became a drifting rack-heap freighted with wounded and dying poor souls (my young brother Henry among them), pilot Brown had the watch below, and was probably asleep and never knew what killed him; but Ealer escaped unhurt. He and his pilot-house were shot up into the air; then they fell, and Ealer sank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane-deck and the boiler-deck had been, and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck, on top of one of the unexploded boilers, where he lay prone in a fog of scald and deadly steam. But not for long. He did not lose his head\u2014long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it, in any and all emergencies. He held his coat-lapels to his nose with one hand, to keep out the steam, and scrabbled around with the other till he found the joints of his flute, then he took measures to save himself alive, and was successful. I was not on board. I had been put ashore in New Orleans by Captain Klinefelter. The reason\u2014however, I have told all about it in the book called Old Times On The Mississippi, and it isn't important, anyway, it is so long ago.", "17": "When I was a Sunday-school scholar, something more than sixty years ago, I became interested in Satan, and wanted to find out all I could about him. I began to ask questions, but my class-teacher, Mr. Barclay, the stone-mason, was reluctant about answering them, it seemed to me. I was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there wasn't another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a thing. I was greatly interested in the incident of Eve and the serpent, and thought Eve's calmness was perfectly noble. I asked Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who, being approached by a serpent, would not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber. He did not answer my question, but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my age and comprehension. I will say for Mr. Barclay that he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan's history, but he stopped there: he wouldn't allow any discussion of them.", "18": "In the course of time we exhausted the facts. There were only five or six of them; you could set them all down on a visiting-card. I was disappointed. I had been meditating a biography, and was grieved to find that there were no materials. I said as much, with the tears running down. Mr. Barclay's sympathy and compassion were aroused, for he was a most kind and gentle-spirited man, and he patted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a whole vast ocean of materials! I can still feel the happy thrill which these blessed words shot through me.", "19": "Then he began to bail out that ocean's riches for my encouragement and joy. Like this: it was \"conjectured\"\u2014though not established\u2014that Satan was originally an angel in Heaven; that he fell; that he rebelled, and brought on a war; that he was defeated, and banished to perdition. Also, \"we have reason to believe\" that later he did so and so; that \"we are warranted in supposing\" that at a subsequent time he traveled extensively, seeking whom he might devour; that a couple of centuries afterward, \"as tradition instructs us,\" he took up the cruel trade of tempting people to their ruin, with vast and fearful results; that by and by, \"as the probabilities seem to indicate,\" he may have done certain things, he might have done certain other things, he must have done still other things.", "20": "And so on and so on. We set down the five known facts by themselves on a piece of paper, and numbered it \"page 1\"; then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set down the \"conjectures,\" and \"suppositions,\" and \"maybes,\" and \"perhapses,\" and \"doubtlesses,\" and \"rumors,\" and \"guesses,\" and \"probabilities,\" and \"likelihoods,\" and \"we are permitted to thinks,\" and \"we are warranted in believings,\" and \"might have beens,\" and \"could have beens,\" and \"must have beens,\" and \"unquestionablys,\" and \"without a shadow of doubts\"\u2014and behold!", "21": "Materials? Why, we had enough to build a biography of Shakespeare!", "22": "Yet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write the history of Satan. Why? Because, as he said, he had suspicions\u2014suspicions that my attitude in that matter was not reverent, and that a person must be reverent when writing about the sacred characters. He said any one who spoke flippantly of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world and also be brought to account.", "23": "I assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had wholly misconceived my attitude; that I had the highest respect for Satan, and that my reverence for him equaled, and possibly even exceeded, that of any member of any church. I said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his words that he thought I would make fun of Satan, and deride him, laugh at him, scoff at him; whereas in truth I had never thought of such a thing, but had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and laugh at them. \"What others?\" \"Why, the Supposers, the Perhapsers, the Might-Have-Beeners, the Could-Have-Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters, the We-Are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and all that funny crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a Conjectural Satan thirty miles high.\"", "24": "What did Mr. Barclay do then? Was he disarmed? Was he silenced? No. He was shocked. He was so shocked that he visibly shuddered. He said the Satanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturers were themselves sacred! As sacred as their work. So sacred that whoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their work, could not afterward enter any respectable house, even by the back door.", "25": "How true were his words, and how wise! How fortunate it would have been for me if I had heeded them. But I was young, I was but seven years of age, and vain, foolish, and anxious to attract attention. I wrote the biography, and have never been in a respectable house since.", "26": "How curious and interesting is the parallel\u2014as far as poverty of biographical details is concerned\u2014between Satan and Shakespeare. It is wonderful, it is unique, it stands quite alone, there is nothing resembling it in history, nothing resembling it in romance, nothing approaching it even in tradition. How sublime is their position, and how over-topping, how sky-reaching, how supreme\u2014the two Great Unknowns, the two Illustrious Conjecturabilities! They are the best-known unknown persons that have ever drawn breath upon the planet.", "27": "For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now, of those details of Shakespeare's history which are facts\u2014verified facts, established facts, undisputed facts.", "28": "He was born on the 23d of April, 1564.", "29": "Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write, could not sign their names.", "30": "At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabby and unclean, and densely illiterate. Of the nineteen important men charged with the government of the town, thirteen had to \"make their mark\" in attesting important documents, because they could not write their names.", "31": "Of the first eighteen years of his life nothing is known. They are a blank.", "32": "On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Whateley.", "33": "Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Hathaway. She was eight years his senior.", "34": "William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry. By grace of a reluctantly granted dispensation there was but one publication of the banns.", "35": "Within six months the first child was born.", "36": "About two (blank) years followed, during which period nothing at all happened to Shakespeare, so far as anybody knows.", "37": "Then came twins\u20141585.

A detail of no consequence: other obscurities did it every year of the forty-five of her reign. And remained obscure.", "44": "Three pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then", "45": "In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.", "46": "Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he accumulated money, and also reputation as actor and manager.", "47": "Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become associated with a number of great plays and poems, as (ostensibly) author of the same.", "48": "Some of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he made no protest.", "49": "Then\u20141610-11\u2014he returned to Stratford and settled down for good and all, and busied himself in lending money, trading in tithes, trading in land and houses; shirking a debt of forty-one shillings, borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of his family; suing debtors for shillings and coppers; being sued himself for shillings and coppers; and acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain common, and did not succeed.", "50": "He lived five or six years\u2014till 1616\u2014in the joy of these elevated pursuits. Then he made a will, and signed each of its three pages with his name.", "51": "A thoroughgoing business man's will. It named in minute detail every item of property he owned in the world\u2014houses, lands, sword, silver-gilt bowl, and so on\u2014all the way down to his \"second-best bed\" and its furniture.", "52": "It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the members of his family, overlooking no individual of it. Not even his wife: the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen; the wife whom he had left husbandless so many years; the wife who had had to borrow forty-one shillings in her need, and which the lender was never able to collect of the prosperous husband, but died at last with the money still lacking. No, even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare's will.", "53": "He left her that \"second-best bed.\"", "54": "And not another thing; not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood with.", "55": "It was eminently and conspicuously a business man's will, not a poet's.", "56": "It mentioned not a single book.", "57": "Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and second-best beds in those days, and when a departing person owned one he gave it a high place in his will.", "58": "The will mentioned not a play, not a poem, not an unfinished literary work, not a scrap of manuscript of any kind.", "59": "Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history that has died this poor; the others all left literary remains behind. Also a book. Maybe two.", "60": "If Shakespeare had owned a dog\u2014but we need not go into that: we know he would have mentioned it in his will. If a good dog, Susanna would have got it; if an inferior one his wife would have got a dower interest in it. I wish he had had a dog, just so we could see how painstakingly he would have divided that dog among the family, in his careful business way.", "61": "He signed the will in three places.", "62": "In earlier years he signed two other official documents.", "63": "These five signatures still exist.", "64": "There are no other specimens of his penmanship in existence. Not a line.", "65": "Was he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom he loved, was eight years old when he died, yet she had had no teaching, he left no provision for her education, although he was rich, and in her mature womanhood she couldn't write and couldn't tell her husband's manuscript from anybody else's\u2014she thought it was Shakespeare's.", "66": "When Shakespeare died in Stratford, it was not an event. It made no more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theater-actor would have made. Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting poems, no eulogies, no national tears\u2014there was merely silence, and nothing more. A striking contrast with what happened when Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh, and the other distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare's time passed from life! No praiseful voice was lifted for the lost Bard of Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he lifted his.", "67": "So far as anybody actually knows and can prove, Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.", "68": "So far as anybody knows and can prove, he never wrote a letter to anybody in his life.", "69": "So far as any one knows, he received only one letter during his life.", "70": "So far as any one knows and can prove, Shakespeare of Stratford wrote only one poem during his life. This one is authentic. He did write that one\u2014a fact which stands undisputed; he wrote the whole of it; he wrote the whole of it out of his own head. He commanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb, and he was obeyed. There it abides to this day. This is it: Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare: Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.", "71": "In the list as above set down will be found every positively known fact of Shakespeare's life, lean and meager as the invoice is. Beyond these details we know not a thing about him. All the rest of his vast history, as furnished by the biographers, is built up, course upon course, of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures\u2014an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of inconsequential facts.", "72": "The historians \"suppose\" that Shakespeare attended the Free School in Stratford from the time he was seven years old till he was thirteen. There is no evidence in existence that he ever went to school at all.", "73": "The historians \"infer\" that he got his Latin in that school\u2014the school which they \"suppose\" he attended.", "74": "They \"suppose\" his father's declining fortunes made it necessary for him to leave the school they supposed he attended, and get to work and help support his parents and their ten children. But there is no evidence that he ever entered or returned from the school they suppose he attended.", "75": "They \"suppose\" he assisted his father in the butchering business; and that, being only a boy, he didn't have to do full-grown butchering, but only slaughtered calves. Also, that whenever he killed a calf he made a high-flown speech over it. This supposition rests upon the testimony of a man who wasn't there at the time; a man who got it from a man who could have been there, but did not say whether he was nor not; and neither of them thought to mention it for decades, and decades, and decades, and two more decades after Shakespeare's death (until old age and mental decay had refreshed and vivified their memories). They hadn't two facts in stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen, but only just the one: he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he was at it. Curious. They had only one fact, yet the distinguished citizen had spent twenty-six years in that little town\u2014just half his lifetime. However, rightly viewed, it was the most important fact, indeed almost the only important fact, of Shakespeare's life in Stratford. Rightly viewed. For experience is an author's most valuable asset; experience is the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into the book he writes. Rightly viewed, calf-butchering accounts for \"Titus Andronicus,\" the only play\u2014ain't it?\u2014that the Stratford Shakespeare ever wrote; and yet it is the only one everybody tried to chouse him out of, the Baconians included.", "76": "The historians find themselves \"justified in believing\" that the young Shakespeare poached upon Sir Thomas Lucy's deer preserves and got haled before that magistrate for it. But there is no shred of respectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened.", "77": "The historians, having argued the thing that might have happened into the thing that did happen, found no trouble in turning Sir Thomas Lucy into Mr. Justice Shallow. They have long ago convinced the world\u2014on surmise and without trustworthy evidence\u2014that Shallow is Sir Thomas.", "78": "The next addition to the young Shakespeare's Stratford history comes easy. The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-steeling, and the surmised trial before the magistrate, and the surmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play: result, the young Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh, such a wild young scamp, and that gratuitous slander is established for all time! It is the very way Professor Osborn and I built the colossal skeleton brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high in the Natural History Museum, the awe and admiration of all the world, the stateliest skeleton that exists on the planet. We had nine bones, and we built the rest of him out of plaster of Paris. We ran short of plaster of Paris, or we'd have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the Stratford Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or contained the most plaster.", "79": "Shakespeare pronounced \"Venus and Adonis\" \"the first heir of his invention,\" apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary composition. He should not have said it. It has been an embarrassment to his historians these many, many years. They have to make him write that graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he escaped from Stratford and his family\u20141586 or '87\u2014age, twenty-two, or along there; because within the next five years he wrote five great plays, and could not have found time to write another line.", "80": "It is sorely embarrassing. If he began to slaughter calves, and poach deer, and rollick around, and learn English, at the earliest likely moment\u2014say at thirteen, when he was supposably wrenched from that school where he was supposably storing up Latin for future literary use\u2014he had his youthful hands full, and much more than full. He must have had to put aside his Warwickshire dialect, which wouldn't be understood in London, and study English very hard. Very hard indeed; incredibly hard, almost, if the result of that labor was to be the smooth and rounded and flexible and letter-perfect English of the \"Venus and Adonis\" in the space of ten years; and at the same time learn great and fine and unsurpassable literary form.", "81": "However, it is \"conjectured\" that he accomplished all this and more, much more: learned law and its intricacies; and the complex procedure of the law-courts; and all about soldiering, and sailoring, and the manners and customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society; and likewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned then possessed, and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the lowly and the ignorant; and added thereto a wider and more intimate knowledge of the world's great literatures, ancient and modern, than was possessed by any other man of his time\u2014for he was going to make brilliant and easy and admiration-compelling use of these splendid treasures the moment he got to London. And according to the surmisers, that is what he did. Yes, although there was no one in Stratford able to teach him these things, and no library in the little village to dig them out of. His father could not read, and even the surmisers surmise that he did not keep a library.", "82": "It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyers through being for a time the clerk of a Stratford court; just as a bright lad like me, reared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi, might become perfect in knowledge of the Bering Strait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the veteran exercises of that adventure-bristling trade through catching catfish with a \"trot-line\" Sundays. But the surmise is damaged by the fact that there is no evidence\u2014and not even tradition\u2014that the young Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law-court.", "83": "It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated his law-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London, through \"amusing himself\" by learning book-law in his garret and by picking up lawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts and listening. But it is only surmise; there is no evidence that he ever did either of those things. They are merely a couple of chunks of plaster of Paris.", "84": "There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses in front of the London theaters, mornings and afternoons. Maybe he did. If he did, it seriously shortened his law-study hours and his recreation-time in the courts. In those very days he was writing great plays, and needed all the time he could get. The horse-holding legend ought to be strangled; it too formidably increases the historian's difficulty in accounting for the young Shakespeare's erudition\u2014an erudition which he was acquiring, hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk, every day in those strenuous times, and emptying each day's catch into next day's imperishable drama.", "85": "He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and a knowledge of soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways and talk; also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages: for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these various knowledges, too, into his dramas. How did he acquire these rich assets?", "86": "In the usual way: by surmise. It is surmised that he traveled in Italy and Germany and around, and qualified himself to put their scenic and social aspects upon paper; that he perfected himself in French, Italian, and Spanish on the road; that he went in Leicester's expedition to the Low Countries, as soldier or sutler or something, for several months or years\u2014or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his business\u2014and thus became familiar with soldiership and soldier-ways and soldier-talk and generalship and general-ways and general-talk, and seamanship and sailor-ways and sailor-talk.", "87": "Maybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who held the horses in the mean time; and who studied the books in the garret; and who frolicked in the law-courts for recreation. Also, who did the call-boying and the play-acting.", "88": "For he became a call-boy; and as early as '93 he became a \"vagabond\"\u2014the law's ungentle term for an unlisted actor; and in '94 a \"regular\" and properly and officially listed member of that (in those days) lightly valued and not much respected profession.", "89": "Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theaters, and manager of them. Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business man, and was raking in money with both hands for twenty years. Then in a noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one poem\u2014his only poem, his darling\u2014and laid him down and died: Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare: Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.", "90": "He was probably dead when he wrote it. Still, this is only conjecture. We have only circumstantial evidence. Internal evidence.", "91": "Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute the giant Biography of William Shakespeare? It would strain the Unabridged Dictionary to hold them. He is a brontosaur: nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster of Paris.", "92": "\"WE MAY ASSUME\"", "93": "In the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are transacting business. Two of these cults are known as the Shakespearites and the Baconians, and I am the other one\u2014the Brontosaurian.", "94": "The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's Works; the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosaurian doesn't really know which of them did it, but is quite composedly and contentedly sure that Shakespeare didn't, and strongly suspects that Bacon did. We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but I am fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind the Baconian assumers have come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Both parties handle the same materials, but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the Shakespearites. The Shakespearite conducts his assuming upon a definite principle, an unchanging and immutable law: which is: 2 and 8 and 7 and 14, added together, make 165. I believe this to be an error. No matter, you cannot get a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials upon any other basis. With the Baconian it is different. If you place before him the above figures and set him to adding them up, he will never in any case get more than 45 out of them, and in nine cases out of ten he will get just the proper 31.", "95": "Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way calculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant and unintelligent. We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that's scarred from stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and is so cultured, so educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him \"all cat-knowledge is his province\"; also, take a mouse. Lock the three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half an hour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian, and let them cipher and assume. The mouse is missing: the question to be decided is, where is it? You can guess both verdicts beforehand. One verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as certainly say the mouse is in the tom-cat.", "96": "The Shakespearite will Reason like this\u2014(that is not my word, it is his). He will say the kitten may have been attending school when nobody was noticing; therefore we are warranted in assuming that it did so; also, it could have been training in a court-clerk's office when no one was noticing; since that could have happened, we are justified in assuming that it did happen; it could have studied catology in a garret when no one was noticing\u2014therefore it did; it could have attended cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation, when no one was noticing, and have harvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way: it could have done it, therefore without a doubt it did; it could have gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one was noticing, and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what to do with a mouse when opportunity offers; the plain inference, therefore, is that that is what it did. Since all these manifold things could have occurred, we have every right to believe they did occur. These patiently and painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing more\u2014opportunity\u2014to convert themselves into triumphant action. The opportunity came, we have the result; beyond shadow of question the mouse is in the kitten.", "97": "It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a \"we think we may assume,\" we expect it, under careful watering and fertilizing and tending, to grow up into a strong and hardy and weather-defying \"there isn't a shadow of a doubt\" at last\u2014and it usually happens.", "98": "We know what the Baconian's verdict would be: \"There is not a rag of evidence that the kitten has had any training, any education, any experience qualifying it for the present occasion, or is indeed equipped for any achievement above lifting such unclaimed milk as comes its way; but there is abundant evidence\u2014unassailable proof, in fact\u2014that the other animal is equipped, to the last detail, with every qualification necessary for the event. without shadow of doubt the tom-cat contains the mouse.\"", "99": "When Shakespeare died, in 1616, great literary productions attributed to him as author had been before the London world and in high favor for twenty-four years. Yet his death was not an event. It made no stir, it attracted no attention. Apparently his eminent literary contemporaries did not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst. Perhaps they knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared, but did not regard him as the author of his Works. \"We are justified in assuming\" this.", "100": "His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford. Does this mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of any kind?", "101": "\"We are privileged to assume\"\u2014no, we are indeed obliged to assume\u2014that such was the case. He had spent the first twenty-two or twenty-three years of his life there, and of course knew everybody and was known by everybody of that day in the town, including the dogs and the cats and the horses. He had spent the last five or six years of his life there, diligently trading in every big and little thing that had money in it; so we are compelled to assume that many of the folk there in those said latter days knew him personally, and the rest by sight and hearsay. But not as a celebrity? Apparently not. For everybody soon forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident connected with him. The dozens of townspeople, still alive, who had known of him or known about him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in the same unremembering condition: if they knew of any incident connected with that period of his life they didn't tell about it. Would they if they had been asked? It is most likely. Were they asked? It is pretty apparent that they were not. Why weren't they? It is a very plausible guess that nobody there or elsewhere was interested to know.", "102": "For seven years after Shakespeare's death nobody seems to have been interested in him. Then the quarto was published, and Ben Jonson awoke out of his long indifference and sang a song of praise and put it in the front of the book. Then silence fell again.", "103": "For sixty years. Then inquiries into Shakespeare's Stratford life began to be made, of Stratfordians. Of Stratfordians who had known Shakespeare or had seen him? No. Then of Stratfordians who had seen people who had known or seen people who had seen Shakespeare? No. Apparently the inquires were only made of Stratfordians who were not Stratfordians of Shakespeare's day, but later comers; and what they had learned had come to them from persons who had not seen Shakespeare; and what they had learned was not claimed as fact, but only as legend\u2014dim and fading and indefinite legend; legend of the calf-slaughtering rank, and not worth remembering either as history or fiction.", "104": "Has it ever happened before\u2014or since\u2014that a celebrated person who had spent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was born and reared, was able to slip out of this world and leave that village voiceless and gossipless behind him\u2014utterly voiceless., utterly gossipless? And permanently so? I don't believe it has happened in any case except Shakespeare's. And couldn't and wouldn't have happened in his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his death.", "105": "When I examine my own case\u2014but let us do that, and see if it will not be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to result, most likely to result, indeed substantially sure to result in the case of a celebrated person, a benefactor of the human race. Like me.", "106": "My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi, when I was two and a half years old. I entered school at five years of age, and drifted from one school to another in the village during nine and a half years. Then my father died, leaving his family in exceedingly straitened circumstances; wherefore my book-education came to a standstill forever, and I became a printer's apprentice, on board and clothes, and when the clothes failed I got a hymn-book in place of them. This for summer wear, probably. I lived in Hannibal fifteen and a half years, altogether, then ran away, according to the custom of persons who are intending to become celebrated. I never lived there afterward. Four years later I became a \"cub\" on a Mississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade, and after a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U.S. inspectors rigorously examined me through a couple of long sittings and decided that I knew every inch of the Mississippi\u2014thirteen hundred miles\u2014in the dark and in the day\u2014as well as a baby knows the way to its mother's paps day or night. So they licensed me as a pilot\u2014knighted me, so to speak\u2014and I rose up clothed with authority, a responsible servant of the United States Government.", "107": "Now then. Shakespeare died young\u2014he was only fifty-two. He had lived in his native village twenty-six years, or about that. He died celebrated (if you believe everything you read in the books). Yet when he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it; and for sixty years afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or about his life in Stratford. When the inquirer came at last he got but one fact\u2014no, legend\u2014and got that one at second hand, from a person who had only heard it as a rumor and didn't claim copyright in it as a production of his own. He couldn't, very well, for its date antedated his own birth-date. But necessarily a number of persons were still alive in Stratford who, in the days of their youth, had seen Shakespeare nearly every day in the last five years of his life, and they would have been able to tell that inquirer some first-hand things about him if he had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person of interest to the villagers. Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and interview them? Wasn't it worth while? Wasn't the matter of sufficient consequence? Had the inquirer an engagement to see a dog-fight and couldn't spare the time?", "108": "It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity, there or elsewhere, and no considerable repute as actor and manager.", "109": "Now then, I am away along in life\u2014my seventy-third year being already well behind me\u2014yet sixteen of my Hannibal schoolmates are still alive today, and can tell\u2014and do tell\u2014inquirers dozens and dozens of incidents of their young lives and mine together; things that happened to us in the morning of life, in the blossom of our youth, in the good days, the dear days, \"the days when we went gipsying, a long time ago.\" Most of them creditable to me, too. One child to whom I paid court when she was five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal, and she visited me last summer, traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of railroad without damage to her patience or to her old-young vigor. Another little lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when she was nine years old and I the same, is still alive\u2014in London\u2014and hale and hearty, just as I am. And on the few surviving steamboats\u2014those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets that plied the big river in the beginning of my water-career\u2014which is exactly as long ago as the whole invoice of the life-years of Shakespeare numbers\u2014there are still findable two or three river-pilots who saw me do creditable things in those ancient days; and several white-headed engineers; and several roustabouts and mates; and several deck-hands who used to heave the lead for me and send up on the still night the \"Six\u2014feet\u2014scant!\" that made me shudder, and the \"M-a-r-k\u2014twain!\" that took the shudder away, and presently the darling \"By the d-e-e-p\u2014four!\" that lifted me to heaven for joy. (1) They know about me, and can tell. And so do printers, from St. Louis to New York; and so do newspaper reporters, from Nevada to San Francisco. And so do the police. If Shakespeare had really been celebrated, like me, Stratford could have told things about him; and if my experience goes for anything, they'd have done it.", "110": "If I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide whether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not, I believe I would place before the debaters only the one question, was shakespeare ever a practicing lawyer? and leave everything else out.", "111": "It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely myriad-minded, but also myriad-accomplished: that he not only knew some thousands of things about human life in all its shades and grades, and about the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which men busy themselves in, but that he could talk about the men and their grades and trades accurately, making no mistakes. Maybe it is so, but have the experts spoken, or is it only Tom, Dick, and Harry? Does the exhibit stand upon wide, and loose, and eloquent generalizing\u2014which is not evidence, and not proof\u2014or upon details, particulars, statistics, illustrations, demonstrations?", "112": "Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to only one of Shakespeare's multifarious craft-equipments, so far as my recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon talk abide with me\u2014his law-equipment. I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever examined Shakespeare's battles and sieges and strategies, and then decided and established for good and all that they were militarily flawless; I do not remember that any Nelson, or Drake, or Cook ever examined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate familiarity with that art; I don't remember that any king or prince or duke has ever testified that Shakespeare was letter-perfect in his handling of royal court-manners and the talk and manners of aristocracies; I don't remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian or Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master in those languages; I don't remember\u2014well, I don't remember that there is testimony\u2014great testimony\u2014imposing testimony\u2014unanswerable and unattackable testimony as to any of Shakespeare's hundred specialties, except one\u2014the law.", "113": "Other things change, with time, and the student cannot trace back with certainty the changes that various trades and their processes and technicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a century or two and find out what their processes and technicalities were in those early days, but with the law it is different: it is mile-stoned and documented all the way back, and the master of that wonderful trade, that complex and intricate trade, that awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of knowing whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not; and whether his law-court procedure is correct or not, and whether his legal shop-talk is the shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-made counterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasional loiterings in Westminster.", "114": "Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had every experience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast of our day.

I know the argot of the quartz-mining and milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret Harte introduces that industry into a story, the first time one of his miners opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte got the phrasing by listening\u2014like Shakespeare\u2014I mean the Stratford one\u2014not by experience.

I would put aside the guesses and surmises, and perhapses, and might-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and, we-are-justified-in-presumings,and the rest of those vague specters and shadows and indefinitenesses, and stand or fall, win or lose, by the verdict rendered by the jury upon that single question. If the verdict was Yes, I should feel quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare, the actor, manager, and trader who died so obscure, so forgotten, so destitute of even village consequence, that sixty years afterward no fellow-citizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him, did not write the Works.", "126": "Chapter XIII of The Shakespeare Problem Restated bears the heading \"Shakespeare as a Lawyer,\" and comprises some fifty pages of expert testimony, with comments thereon, and I will copy the first nine, as being sufficient all by themselves, as it seems to me, to settle the question which I have conceived to be the master-key to the Shakespeare-Bacon puzzle.", "127": "This testimony is so strong, so direct, so authoritative; and so uncheapened, unwatered by guesses, and surmises, and maybe-so's, and might-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and the rest of that ton of plaster of Paris out of which the biographers have built the colossal brontosaur which goes by the Stratford actor's name, that it quite convinces me that the man who wrote Shakespeare's Works knew all about law and lawyers.

The upholders of the Stratford-Shakespeare superstition call us the hardest names they can think of, and they keep doing it all the time; very well, if they like to descend to that level, let them do it, but I will not so undignify myself as to follow them. I cannot call them harsh names; the most I can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my disapproval; and this without malice, without venom.", "132": "To resume.

Why a dozen, instead of only one or two? One reason is, because there are a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that poem. Do you remember \"Beautiful Snow\"? Do you remember \"Rock Me to Sleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep\"? Do you remember \"Backward, turn, backward, O Time, in thy flight! Make me a child again just for tonight\"? I remember them very well. Their authorship was claimed by most of the grown-up people who were alive at the time, and every claimant had one plausible argument in his favor, at least\u2014to wit, he could have done the authoring; he was competent.", "135": "Have the Works been claimed by a dozen? They haven't. There was good reason. The world knows there was but one man on the planet at the time who was competent\u2014not a dozen, and not two. A long time ago the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find a procession of prodigious footprints stretching across the plain\u2014footprints that were three miles apart, each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep, and with forests and villages mashed to mush in it. Was there any doubt as to who made that mighty trail? Were there a dozen claimants? Where there two? No\u2014the people knew who it was that had been along there: there was only one Hercules.", "136": "There has been only one Shakespeare. There couldn't be two; certainly there couldn't be two at the same time. It takes ages to bring forth a Shakespeare, and some more ages to match him. This one was not matched before his time; nor during his time; and hasn't been matched since. The prospect of matching him in our time is not bright.", "137": "The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not qualified to write the Works, and that Francis Bacon was. They claim that Bacon possessed the stupendous equipment\u2014both natural and acquired\u2014for the miracle; and that no other Englishman of his day possessed the like; or, indeed, anything closely approaching it.", "138": "Macaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor and horizonless magnitude of that equipment. Also, he has synopsized Bacon's history\u2014a thing which cannot be done for the Stratford Shakespeare, for he hasn't any history to synopsize. Bacon's history is open to the world, from his boyhood to his death in old age\u2014a history consisting of known facts, displayed in minute and multitudinous detail; facts, not guesses and conjectures and might-have-beens.", "139": "Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen, and had a Lord Chancellor for his father, and a mother who was \"distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian: she corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewell, and translated his Apologia from the Latin so correctly that neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration.\" It is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations and aspirations shall tend. The atmosphere furnished by the parents to the son in this present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning; with thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects; and with polite culture. It had its natural effect. Shakespeare of Stratford was reared in a house which had no use for books, since its owners, his parents, were without education. This may have had an effect upon the son, but we do not know, because we have no history of him of an informing sort. There were but few books anywhere, in that day, and only the well-to-do and highly educated possessed them, they being almost confined to the dead languages. \"All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single shelf\"\u2014imagine it! The few existing books were in the Latin tongue mainly. \"A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance\u2014not merely with Cicero and Virgil, but with the most interesting memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own time\"\u2014a literature necessary to the Stratford lad, for his fictitious reputation's sake, since the writer of his Works would begin to use it wholesale and in a most masterly way before the lad was hardly more than out of his teens and into his twenties.", "140": "At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent three years there. Thence he went to Paris in the train of the English Ambassador, and there he mingled daily with the wise, the cultured, the great, and the aristocracy of fashion, during another three years. A total of six years spent at the sources of knowledge; knowledge both of books and of men. The three spent at the university were coeval with the second and last three spent by the little Stratford lad at Stratford school supposedly, and perhapsedly, and maybe, and by inference\u2014with nothing to infer from. The second three of the Baconian six were \"presumably\" spent by the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher. That is, the thugs presume it\u2014on no evidence of any kind. Which is their way, when they want a historical fact. Fact and presumption are, for business purposes, all the same to them. They know the difference, but they also know how to blink it. They know, too, that while in history-building a fact is better than a presumption, it doesn't take a presumption long to bloom into a fact when they have the handling of it. They know by old experience that when they get hold of a presumption-tadpole he is not going to stay tadpole in their history-tank; no, they know how to develop him into the giant four-legged bullfrog of fact, and make him sit up on his hams, and puff out his chin, and look important and insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure authenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince everybody because it is so loud. The thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty persons where reasoning convinces but one. I wouldn't be a thug, not even if\u2014but never mind about that, it has nothing to do with the argument, and it is not noble in spirit besides. If I am better than a thug, is the merit mine? No, it is His. Then to Him be the praise. That is the right spirit.", "141": "They \"presume\" the lad severed his \"presumed\" connection with the Stratford school to become apprentice to a butcher. They also \"presume\" that the butcher was his father. They don't know. There is no written record of it, nor any other actual evidence. If it would have helped their case any, they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers, to fifty butchers, to a wilderness of butchers\u2014all by their patented method \"presumption.\" If it will help their case they will do it yet; and if it will further help it, they will \"presume\" that all those butchers were his father. And the week after, they will say it. Why, it is just like being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial incandescent hypodermic irregular accusative Noun of Multitude; which is father to the expression which the grammarians call Verb. It is like a whole ancestry, with only one posterity.", "142": "To resume. Next, the young Bacon took up the study of law, and mastered that abstruse science. From that day to the end of his life he was daily in close contact with lawyers and judges; not as a casual onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of a theater, but as a practicing lawyer\u2014a great and successful one, a renowned one, a Launcelot of the bar, the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood of the legal Table Round; he lived in the law's atmosphere thenceforth, all his years, and by sheer ability forced his way up its difficult steeps to its supremest summit, the Lord-Chancellorship, leaving behind him no fellow-craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that majestic place.", "143": "When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the other illustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses, brilliances, profundities, and felicities so prodigally displayed in the Plays, and try to fit them to the historyless Stratford stage-manager, they sound wild, strange, incredible, ludicrous; but when we put them in the mouth of Bacon they do not sound strange, they seem in their natural and rightful place, they seem at home there. Please turn back and read them again. Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are meaningless, they are inebriate extravagancies\u2014intemperate admirations of the dark side of the moon, so to speak; attributed to Bacon, they are admirations of the golden glories of the moon's front side, the moon at the full\u2014and not intemperate, not overwrought, but sane and right, and justified. \"At every turn and point at which the author required a metaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever turned first to the law; he seems almost to have thought in legal phrases; the commonest legal phrases, the commonest of legal expressions, were ever at the end of his pen.\" That could happen to no one but a person whose trade was the law; it could not happen to a dabbler in it. Veteran mariners fill their conversation with sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the sea and the storm, but no mere passenger ever does it, be he of Stratford or elsewhere; or could do it with anything resembling accuracy, if he were hardy enough to try. Please read again what Lord Campbell and the other great authorities have said about Bacon when they thought they were saying it about Shakespeare of Stratford.", "144": "The author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man of his time, with wisdom, erudition, imagination, capaciousness of mind, grace, and majesty of expression. Every one has said it, no one doubts it. Also, he had humor, humor in rich abundance, and always wanting to break out. We have no evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford possessed any of these gifts or any of these acquirements. The only lines he ever wrote, so far as we know, are substantially barren of them\u2014barren of all of them. Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare: Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.", "145": "Ben Jonson says of Bacon, as orator:", "146": "From Macaulay:", "147": "Again:", "148": "To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney-General and Solicitor-General would have satisfied the appetite of any other man for hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast literary industries just described, to satisfy his. He was a born worker.", "149": "Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment, and quiet his appetite for work? Not entirely:", "150": "Here are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw light upon Bacon, and seem to indicate\u2014and maybe demonstrate\u2014that he was competent to write the Plays and Poems:", "151": "There are too many places in the Plays where this happens. Poor old dying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate puns at his own name, is a pathetic instance of it. \"We may assume\" that it is Bacon's fault, but the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame.", "152": "It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and each and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed in the Plays and Poems, and in much higher and richer degree than any other man of his time or of any previous time. He was a genius without a mate, a prodigy not matable. There was only one of him; the planet could not produce two of him at one birth, nor in one age. He could have written anything that is in the Plays and Poems. He could have written this:The cloud-cap'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like an insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.", "153": "Also, he could have written this, but he refrained: Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare: Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.", "154": "When a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap'd towers, he ought not to follow it immediately with Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare, because he will find the transition from great poetry to poor prose too violent for comfort. It will give him a shock. You never notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is until you bite into a layer of it in a pie.", "155": "Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare's Works? Ah, now, what do you take me for? Would I be so soft as that, after having known the human race familiarly for nearly seventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any one could think so injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me. No, no, I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind, it will never be possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine sincerely, dispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition. I doubt if I could do it myself. We always get at second hand our notions about systems of government; and high tariff and low tariff; and prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and the glories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and approval of the duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefs concerning the nature of cats; and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic; and our preferences in the matter of religious and political parties; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the Author Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second hand, we reason none of them out for ourselves. It is the way we are made. It is the way we are all made, and we can't help it, we can't change it. And whenever we have been furnished a fetish, and have been taught to believe in it, and love it and worship it, and refrain from examining it, there is no evidence, howsoever clear and strong, that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion. In morals, conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment and associations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash. Whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels, and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels, we keep our sacrilegious hands off it. We submit, not reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately afraid we should find, upon examination that the jewels are of the sort that are manufactured at North Adams, Mass.", "156": "I haven't any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal this side of the year 2209. Disbelief in him cannot come swiftly, disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar baby has never been known to disintegrate swiftly; it is a very slow process. It took several thousand years to convince our fine race\u2014including every splendid intellect in it\u2014that there is no such thing as a witch; it has taken several thousand years to convince the same fine race\u2014including every splendid intellect in it\u2014that there is no such person as Satan; it has taken several centuries to remove perdition from the Protestant Church's program of post-mortem entertainments; it has taken a weary long time to persuade American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to bear it the best they can; and it looks as if their Scotch brethren will still be burning babies in the everlasting fires when Shakespeare comes down from his perch.", "157": "We are The Reasoning Race. We can't prove it by the above examples, and we can't prove it by the miraculous \"histories\" built by those Stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust, but there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by, if I could think of them. We are The Reasoning Race, and when we find a vague file of chipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust of Stratford village, we know by our reasoning bowers that Hercules has been along there. I feel that our fetish is safe for three centuries yet. The bust, too\u2014there in the Stratford Church. The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust, the serene bust, the emotionless bust, with the dandy mustache, and the putty face, unseamed of care\u2014that face which has looked passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will still look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep, deep, deep, subtle, subtle, subtle expression of a bladder.", "158": "One of the most trying defects which I find in these\u2014these\u2014what shall I call them? for I will not apply injurious epithets to them, the way they do to us, such violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature and my dignity. The farthest I can go in that direction is to call them by names of limited reverence\u2014names merely descriptive, never unkind, never offensive, never tainted by harsh feeling. If they would do like this, they would feel better in their hearts. Very well, then\u2014to proceed. One of the most trying defects which I find in these Stratfordolaters, these Shakesperiods, these thugs, these bangalores, these troglodytes, these herumfrodites, these blatherskites, these buccaneers, these bandoleers, is their spirit of irreverence. It is detectable in every utterance of theirs when they are talking about us. I am thankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit. When a thing is sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it. I cannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent, except towards the things which were sacred to other people. Am I in the right? I think so. But I ask no one to take my unsupported word; no, look at the dictionary; let the dictionary decide. Here is the definition:", "159": "What does the Hindu say? He says it is correct. He says irreverence is lack of respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, and Chrishna, and his other gods, and for his sacred cattle, and for his temples and the things within them. He endorses the definition, you see; and there are 300,000,000 Hindus or their equivalents back of him.", "160": "The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G it could restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for our Deity and our sacred things, but that ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried: for by the simple process of spelling his deities with capitals the Hindu confiscates the definition and restricts it to his own sects, thus making it clearly compulsory upon us to revere his gods and his sacred things, and nobody's else. We can't say a word, for he has our own dictionary at his back, and its decision is final.", "161": "This law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1. Whatever is sacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by everybody else; 2. whatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held in reverence by everybody else; 3. therefore, by consequence, logically, and indisputably, whatever is sacred to me must be held in reverence by everybody else.", "162": "Now then, what aggravates me is that these troglodytes and muscovites and bandoleers and buccaneers are also trying to crowd in and share the benefit of the law, and compel everybody to revere their Shakespeare and hold him sacred. We can't have that: there's enough of us already. If you go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege, it will presently come to be conceded that each man's sacred things are the only ones, and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them or suffer for it. That can surely happen, and when it happens, the word Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless, and foolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and impudent, and dictatorial word in the language. And people will say, \"Whose business is it what gods I worship and what things hold sacred? Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?\"", "163": "We cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us. We must save the word from this destruction. There is but one way to do it, and that is to stop the spread of the privilege and strictly confine it to its present limits\u2014that is, to all the Christian sects, to all the Hindu sects, and me. We do not need any more, the stock is watered enough, just as it is.", "164": "It would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone. I think so because I am the only sect that knows how to employ it gently, kindly, charitably, dispassionately. The other sects lack the quality of self-restraint. The Catholic Church says the most irreverent things about matters which are sacred to the Protestants, and the Protestant Church retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which Catholics hold sacred; then both of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas Paine and charge him with irreverence. This is all unfortunate, because it makes it difficult for students equipped with only a low grade of mentality to find out what Irreverence really is.", "165": "It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me. Then there will be no more quarreling, no more bandying of disrespectful epithets, no more heartburnings.", "166": "There will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare controversy except what is sacred to me. That will simplify the whole matter, and trouble will cease. There will be irreverence no longer, because I will not allow it. The first time those criminals charge me with irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet -of-Khorassan will be the last. Taught by the methods found effective in extinguishing earlier offenders by the Inquisition, of holy memory, I shall know how to quiet them.", "167": "Isn't it odd, when you think of it, that you may list all the celebrated Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern times, clear back to the first Tudors\u2014a list containing five hundred names, shall we say?\u2014and you can go to the histories, biographies, and cyclopedias and learn the particulars of the lives of every one of them. Every one of them except one\u2014the most famous, the most renowned\u2014by far the most illustrious of them all\u2014Shakespeare! You can get the details of the lives of all the celebrated ecclesiastics in the list; all the celebrated tragedians, comedians, singers, dancers, orators, judges, lawyers, poets, dramatists, historians, biographers, editors, inventors, reformers, statesmen, generals, admirals, discoverers, prize-fighters, murderers, pirates, conspirators, horse-jockeys, bunco-steerers, misers, swindlers, explorers, adventurers by land and sea, bankers, financiers, astronomers, naturalists, claimants, impostors, chemists, biologists, geologists, philologists, college presidents and professors, architects, engineers, painters, sculptors, politicians, agitators, rebels, revolutionists, patriots, demagogues, clowns, cooks, freaks, philosophers, burglars, highwaymen, journalists, physicians, surgeons\u2014you can get the life-histories of all of them but one. Just one\u2014the most extraordinary and the most celebrated of them all\u2014Shakespeare!", "168": "You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries, and you can find out the life-histories of all those people, too. You will then have listed fifteen hundred celebrities, and you can trace the authentic life-histories of the whole of them. Save one\u2014far and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation\u2014Shakespeare! About him you can find out nothing. Nothing of even the slightest importance. Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory. Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace person\u2014a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave. We can go to the records and find out the life-history of every renowned race-horse of modern times\u2014but not Shakespeare's! There are many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cart-loads (of guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly sufficient all by itself\u2014he hadn't any history to record. There is no way of getting around that deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance.", "169": "Its quite plain significance\u2014to any but those thugs (I do not use the term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived, and none until he had been dead two or three generations. The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not find it out. He ought to have explained that he was the author, and not merely a nom de plume for another man to hide behind. If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones, and more solicitous about his Works, it would have been better for his good name, and a kindness to us. The bones were not important. They will moulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until the last sun goes down.", "170": "P.S. March 25. About two months ago I was illuminating this Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant. And not only in great London, but also in the little village where he was born, where he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried. I argued that if he had been a person of any note at all, aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his death, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him. I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been famous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in Missouri. It is a good argument, a prodigiously strong one, and most formidable one for even the most gifted and ingenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away. Today a Hannibal Courier-Post of recent date has reached me, with an article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty years. I will make an extract from it:", "171": "And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper, of date twenty days ago:", "172": "I remember her well. I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago. She was at that time nine years old, and I was about eleven. I remember where she stood, and how she looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock. She was crying. What it was about I have long ago forgotten. But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me, no doubt. She was a good child, I can say that for her. She knew me nearly seventy years ago. Did she forget me, in the course of time? I think not. If she had lived in Stratford in Shakespeare's time, would she have forgotten him? Yes. For he was never famous during his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and there wouldn't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a week.", "173": "\"Injun Joe,\" \"Jimmy Finn,\" and \"General Gaines\" were prominent and very intemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago. Plenty of grayheads there remember them to this day, and can tell you about them. Isn't it curious that two \"town drunkards\" and one half-breed loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his lifetime?"}}}, {"title": "Alexander's Bridge", "author": "Cather, Willa, 1873-1947", "edition": null, "pub_info": null, "form": null, "segments": {"CHAPTER I": {"0": "Late one brilliant April afternoon Professor Lucius Wilson stood at the head of Chestnut Street, looking about him with the pleased air of a man of taste who does not very often get to Boston. He had lived there as a student, but for twenty years and more, since he had been Professor of Philosophy in a Western university, he had seldom come East except to take a steamer for some foreign port. Wilson was standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the slanting street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses, and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still shining. The gleam of the river at the foot of the hill made him blink a little, not so much because it was too bright as because he found it so pleasant. The few passers-by glanced at him unconcernedly, and even the children who hurried along with their school-bags under their arms seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should be standing there, looking up through his glasses at the gray housetops.", "1": "The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs and the watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down the hill, descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow. His nostril, long unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood smoke in the air, blended with the odor of moist spring earth and the saltiness that came up the river with the tide. He crossed Charles Street between jangling street cars and shelving lumber drays, and after a moment of uncertainty wound into Brimmer Street. The street was quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite direction. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have slackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal, appreciative glance. She was a person of distinction he saw at once, and, moreover, very handsome. She was tall, carried her beautiful head proudly, and moved with ease and certainty. One immediately took for granted the costly privileges and fine spaces that must lie in the background from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and elegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,\u2014for, in his way, he had an eye for such things,\u2014particularly her brown furs and her hat. He got a blurred impression of her fine color, the violets she wore, her white gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a flight of steps in front of him and disappeared.", "2": "Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as completely and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long anticipated, and definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For a few pleasurable seconds he quite forgot where he was going, and only after the door had closed behind her did he realize that the young woman had entered the house to which he had directed his trunk from the South Station that morning. He hesitated a moment before mounting the steps. \u201cCan that,\u201d he murmured in amazement,\u2014\u201ccan that possibly have been Mrs. Alexander?\u201d", "3": "When the servant admitted him, Mrs. Alexander was still standing in the hallway. She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her hand.", "4": "\u201cIs it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get here before I did. I was detained at a concert, and Bartley telephoned that he would be late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather have your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with me, while we wait for Bartley?\u201d", "5": "Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid walk, and with her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He followed her through the drawing-room into the library, where the wide back windows looked out upon the garden and the sunset and a fine stretch of silver-colored river. A harp-shaped elm stood stripped against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year\u2019s birds\u2019 nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star quivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a rich and amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed in front of the wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed chair and began to pour it, while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite her and took his cup with a great sense of ease and harmony and comfort.", "6": "\u201cYou have had a long journey, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mrs. Alexander asked, after showing gracious concern about his tea. \u201cAnd I am so sorry Bartley is late. He\u2019s often tired when he\u2019s late. He flatters himself that it is a little on his account that you have come to this Congress of Psychologists.\u201d", "7": "\u201cIt is,\u201d Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; \u201cand I hope he won\u2019t be tired tonight. But, on my own account, I\u2019m glad to have a few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to know you.\u201d", "8": "\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d She nodded at him above her cup and smiled, but there was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been there when she greeted him in the hall.", "9": "Wilson leaned forward. \u201cHave I said something awkward? I live very far out of the world, you know. But I didn\u2019t mean that you would exactly fade dim, even if Bartley were here.\u201d", "10": "Mrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not so vain! How terribly discerning you are.\u201d", "11": "She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank glance brought about an understanding between them.", "12": "He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly liked her eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were like a glimpse of fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather.", "13": "\u201cSince you noticed something,\u201d Mrs. Alexander went on, \u201cit must have been a flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of the people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they were talking of someone I had never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it would seem that he grew up among the strangest people. They usually say that he has turned out very well, or remark that he always was a fine fellow. I never know what reply to make.\u201d", "14": "Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot gently. \u201cI expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well, Mrs. Alexander. Though I will say for myself that I was always confident he\u2019d do something extraordinary.\u201d", "15": "Mrs. Alexander\u2019s shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of impatience. \u201cOh, I should think that might have been a safe prediction. Another cup, please?\u201d", "16": "\u201cYes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as you might imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose their courage; and some never get a fair wind. Bartley\u201d\u2014he dropped his chin on the back of his long hand and looked at her admiringly\u2014\u201cBartley caught the wind early, and it has sung in his sails ever since.\u201d", "17": "Mrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and Wilson studied her half-averted face. He liked the suggestion of stormy possibilities in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that, he reflected, she would be too cold.", "18": "\u201cI should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy. I don\u2019t believe he remembers,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cWon\u2019t you smoke, Mr. Wilson?\u201d", "19": "Wilson lit a cigarette. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose he does. He was never introspective. He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known. We didn\u2019t know exactly what to do with him.\u201d", "20": "A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander screened her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw wavering bright spots on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened.", "21": "\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cI now and again hear stories about things that happened when he was in college.\u201d", "22": "\u201cBut that isn\u2019t what you want.\u201d Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at her with the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. \u201cWhat you want is a picture of him, standing back there at the other end of twenty years. You want to look down through my memory.\u201d", "23": "She dropped her hands in her lap. \u201cYes, yes; that\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d", "24": "At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson laughed as Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. \u201cThere he is. Away with perspective! No past, no future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The only moment that ever was or will be in the world!\u201d", "25": "The door from the hall opened, a voice called \u201cWinifred?\u201d hurriedly, and a big man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread, bringing with him a smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air. When Alexander reached the library door, he switched on the lights and stood six feet and more in the archway, glowing with strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks. There were other bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always Alexander\u2019s picture that the Sunday Supplement men wanted, because he looked as a tamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his head seemed as hard and powerful as a catapult, and his shoulders looked strong enough in themselves to support a span of any one of his ten great bridges that cut the air above as many rivers.", "26": "After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room over the library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of white lights along the Cambridge Embankment. The room was not at all what one might expect of an engineer\u2019s study. Wilson felt at once the harmony of beautiful things that have lived long together without obtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of Alexander\u2019s doing, of course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing before he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place there,\u2014that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for his vigor and vehemence. He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in the cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled above his broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth hand, a flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned.", "27": "\u201cYou are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells me.\u201d", "28": "\u201cYes, for a few weeks only. There\u2019s a meeting of British engineers, and I\u2019m doing another bridge in Canada, you know.\u201d", "29": "\u201cOh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your wife, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "30": "\u201cYes, at Allway. She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most remarkable old lady. I was working with MacKeller then, an old Scotch engineer who had picked me up in London and taken me back to Quebec with him. He had the contract for the Allway Bridge, but before he began work on it he found out that he was going to die, and he advised the committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I\u2019d never have got anything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of Mrs. Pemberton, Winifred\u2019s aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway she asked me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady.\u201d", "31": "\u201cLike her niece?\u201d Wilson queried.", "32": "Bartley laughed. \u201cShe had been very handsome, but not in Winifred\u2019s way. When I knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white, with a splendid head and a face like fine old lace, somehow,\u2014but perhaps I always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair. She had such a flavor of life about her. She had known Gordon and Livingstone and Beaconsfield when she was young,\u2014every one. She was the first woman of that sort I\u2019d ever known. You know how it is in the West,\u2014old people are poked out of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done. I used to go up from the works to have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It was very stimulating, for she couldn\u2019t tolerate stupidity.\u201d", "33": "\u201cIt must have been then that your luck began, Bartley,\u201d said Wilson, flicking his cigar ash with his long finger. \u201cIt\u2019s curious, watching boys,\u201d he went on reflectively. \u201cI\u2019m sure I did you justice in the matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot where some day strain would tell. Even after you began to climb, I stood down in the crowd and watched you with\u2014well, not with confidence. The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your facade rose, the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from top to bottom,\u201d\u2014he indicated its course in the air with his forefinger,\u2014\u201cthen a crash and clouds of dust. It was curious. I had such a clear picture of it. And another curious thing, Bartley,\u201d Wilson spoke with deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, \u201cis that I don\u2019t feel it any longer. I am sure of you.\u201d", "34": "Alexander laughed. \u201cNonsense! It\u2019s not I you feel sure of; it\u2019s Winifred. People often make that mistake.\u201d", "35": "\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Alexander. You\u2019ve changed. You have decided to leave some birds in the bushes. You used to want them all.\u201d", "36": "Alexander\u2019s chair creaked. \u201cI still want a good many,\u201d he said rather gloomily. \u201cAfter all, life doesn\u2019t offer a man much. You work like the devil and think you\u2019re getting on, and suddenly you discover that you\u2019ve only been getting yourself tied up. A million details drink you dry. Your life keeps going for things you don\u2019t want, and all the while you are being built alive into a social structure you don\u2019t care a rap about. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I\u2019d have been if I hadn\u2019t been this sort; I want to go and live out his potentialities, too. I haven\u2019t forgotten that there are birds in the bushes.\u201d", "37": "Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust forward as if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him, wondering. His old pupil always stimulated him at first, and then vastly wearied him. The machinery was always pounding away in this man, and Wilson preferred companions of a more reflective habit of mind. He could not help feeling that there were unreasoning and unreasonable activities going on in Alexander all the while; that even after dinner, when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley had merely closed the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The machinery itself was still pounding on.", "38": "Bartley\u2019s abstraction and Wilson\u2019s reflections were cut short by a rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander was standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she shook her head.", "39": "\u201cNo, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor Wilson were quite comfortable. I am going down to the music-room.\u201d", "40": "\u201cWhy not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are tired of talk.\u201d", "41": "\u201cYes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander,\u201d Wilson began, but he got no further.", "42": "\u201cWhy, certainly, if you won\u2019t find me too noisy. I am working on the Schumann `Carnival,\u2019 and, though I don\u2019t practice a great many hours, I am very methodical,\u201d Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an upright piano that stood at the back of the room, near the windows.", "43": "Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair behind her. She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling. Wilson could not imagine her permitting herself to do anything badly, but he was surprised at the cleanness of her execution. He wondered how a woman with so many duties had managed to keep herself up to a standard really professional. It must take a great deal of time, certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time. Wilson reflected that he had never before known a woman who had been able, for any considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual passion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration, shading his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even younger than in street clothes, and, for all her composure and self-sufficiency, she seemed to him strangely alert and vibrating, as if in her, too, there were something never altogether at rest. He felt that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people and what she demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten years she must know him; and however one took him, however much one admired him, one had to admit that he simply wouldn\u2019t square. He was a natural force, certainly, but beyond that, Wilson felt, he was not anything very really or for very long at a time.", "44": "Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley\u2019s profile was still wreathed in cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His shoulders were sunk deep in the cushions and one hand hung large and passive over the arm of his chair. He had slipped on a purple velvet smoking-coat. His wife, Wilson surmised, had chosen it. She was clearly very proud of his good looks and his fine color. But, with the glow of an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer\u2019s face looked tired, even a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly above the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped forward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson thought that beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling weariness of on-coming middle age.", "45": "The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden under the declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs. Alexander at the tea-table in the library.", "46": "\u201cWell,\u201d he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself, \u201cthere was a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley at his club, more psychologists, and here I am. I\u2019ve looked forward to this hour all day.\u201d", "47": "Mrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. \u201cAnd do you remember where we stopped yesterday?\u201d", "48": "\u201cPerfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I have color enough in me. Bartley makes me feel a faded monochrome. You can\u2019t get at the young Bartley except by means of color.\u201d Wilson paused and deliberated. Suddenly he broke out: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a remarkable student, you know, though he was always strong in higher mathematics. His work in my own department was quite ordinary. It was as a powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the most interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a scientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing qualities so much oftener than we find force.\u201d", "49": "\u201cAnd, after all,\u201d said Mrs. Alexander, \u201cthat is the thing we all live upon. It is the thing that takes us forward.\u201d", "50": "Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. \u201cExactly,\u201d he assented warmly. \u201cIt builds the bridges into the future, over which the feet of every one of us will go.\u201d", "51": "\u201cHow interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into the future\u2014I often say that to myself. Bartley\u2019s bridges always seem to me like that. Have you ever seen his first suspension bridge in Canada, the one he was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it sometime. We were married as soon as it was finished, and you will laugh when I tell you that it always has a rather bridal look to me. It is over the wildest river, with mists and clouds always battling about it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging in the sky. It really was a bridge into the future. You have only to look at it to feel that it meant the beginning of a great career. But I have a photograph of it here.\u201d She drew a portfolio from behind a bookcase. \u201cAnd there, you see, on the hill, is my aunt\u2019s house.\u201d", "52": "Wilson took up the photograph. \u201cBartley was telling me something about your aunt last night. She must have been a delightful person.\u201d", "53": "Winifred laughed. \u201cThe bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the hill, and the noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But after she met Bartley she pretended to like it, and said it was a good thing to be reminded that there were things going on in the world. She loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he came to the house. Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank, Early-Victorian manner. She liked men of action, and disliked young men who were careful of themselves and who, as she put it, were always trimming their wick as if they were afraid of their oil\u2019s giving out. MacKeller, Bartley\u2019s first chief, was an old friend of my aunt, and he told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which really pleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk after Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt Eleanor had found him much to her taste, but she hadn\u2019t said anything. Presently she came out, with a chuckle: `MacKeller found him sowing wild oats in London, I believe. I hope he didn\u2019t stop him too soon. Life coquets with dashing fellows. The coming men are always like that. We must have him to dinner, my dear.\u2019 And we did. She grew much fonder of Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna, and she thought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics, and she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used to declare that the Prince Consort had brought all that stuff over out of Germany. She always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him. She considered that a newfangled way of making a match of it.\u201d", "54": "When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his wife still confronting the photograph. \u201cOh, let us get that out of the way,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWinifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down. I\u2019ve decided to go over to New York to-morrow night and take a fast boat. I shall save two days.\u201d"}, "CHAPTER II": {"0": "On the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to the hotel on the Embankment at which he always stopped, and in the lobby he was accosted by an old acquaintance, Maurice Mainhall, who fell upon him with effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to dine with him. Bartley never dined alone if he could help it, and Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew what had been going on in town; especially, he knew everything that was not printed in the newspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them. He had written a number of books himself; among them a \u201cHistory of Dancing,\u201d a \u201cHistory of Costume,\u201d a \u201cKey to Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets,\u201d a study of \u201cThe Poetry of Ernest Dowson,\u201d etc. Although Mainhall\u2019s enthusiasm was often tiresome, and although he was often unable to distinguish between facts and vivid figments of his imagination, his imperturbable good nature overcame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by becoming, in a reluctant manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage-Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair. He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music. Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics. He hated them when they presumed to be anything else.", "1": "While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes of his old friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed that they should go to see Hugh MacConnell\u2019s new comedy, \u201cBog Lights.\u201d", "2": "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite the best thing MacConnell\u2019s done,\u201d he explained as they got into a hansom. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously well put on, too. Florence Merrill and Cyril Henderson. But Hilda Burgoyne\u2019s the hit of the piece. Hugh\u2019s written a delightful part for her, and she\u2019s quite inexpressible. It\u2019s been on only two weeks, and I\u2019ve been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell\u2019s box for tonight or there\u2019d be no chance of our getting places. There\u2019s everything in seeing Hilda while she\u2019s fresh in a part. She\u2019s apt to grow a bit stale after a time. The ones who have any imagination do.\u201d", "3": "\u201cHilda Burgoyne!\u201d Alexander exclaimed mildly. \u201cWhy, I haven\u2019t heard of her for\u2014years.\u201d", "4": "Mainhall laughed. \u201cThen you can\u2019t have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It\u2019s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she\u2019s come up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in London\u2014but what can one expect? Do you know, Alexander,\u201d\u2014Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,\u2014\u201cdo you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.\u201d", "5": "Just then they drove up to the Duke of York\u2019s, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre. When they entered the stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander\u2019s attention to the stage. Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he reflected, \u201cthere\u2019s small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless hasn\u2019t thought of me for years.\u201d He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell\u2019s irresistible comedy. The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey-girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing.", "6": "\u201cYou see,\u201d he murmured in Alexander\u2019s ear, as the curtain fell on the first act, \u201cone almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness. Of course, Hilda is Irish,\u2014the Burgoynes have been stage people for generations,\u2014and she has the Irish voice. It\u2019s delightful to hear it in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips\u2014who ever heard it out of Galway? She saves her hand, too. She\u2019s at her best in the second act. She\u2019s really MacConnell\u2019s poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale.\u201d", "7": "The second act opened before Philly Doyle\u2019s underground still, with Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather. Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall\u2019s sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest. As Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful brown eyes. When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar. After her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly\u2019s burrow, where she sat singing \u201cThe Rising of the Moon\u201d and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey.", "8": "When the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the corridor. They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar. Presently he hailed a tall, bearded man, grim-browed and rather battered-looking, who had his opera cloak on his arm and his hat in his hand, and who seemed to be on the point of leaving the theatre.", "9": "\u201cMacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It\u2019s going famously to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You\u2019ll never do anything like this again, mark me. A man writes to the top of his bent only once.\u201d", "10": "The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded eyes and made a wry face. \u201cAnd have I done anything so fool as that, now?\u201d he asked.", "11": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I was saying,\u201d Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never bring Hilda out like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn\u2019t possibly be better, you know.\u201d", "12": "MacConnell grunted. \u201cShe\u2019ll do well enough if she keeps her pace and doesn\u2019t go off on us in the middle of the season, as she\u2019s more than like to do.\u201d", "13": "He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.", "14": "\u201cPoor old Hugh,\u201d Mainhall murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s hit terribly hard. He\u2019s been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more. She doesn\u2019t take up with anybody, you know. Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning. One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe. I dare say it\u2019s quite true that there\u2019s never been any one else.\u201d Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him. Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: \u201cShe\u2019s an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that. Here comes Sir Harry Towne. He\u2019s another who\u2019s awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer.\u201d", "15": "Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.", "16": "Mainhall cut in impatiently.", "17": "\u201cI say, Sir Harry, the little girl\u2019s going famously to-night, isn\u2019t she?\u201d", "18": "Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously. \u201cDo you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she\u2019s feeling rather seedy, poor child. Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself. A little attack of nerves, possibly.\u201d", "19": "He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: \u201cYou know Lord Westmere, of course,\u2014the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda.\u201d", "20": "When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing \u201cThe Cloak of Old Gaul.\u201d In a moment Peggy was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest. He even leaned forward over the rail a little. For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience. In the half-light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling with amusement Sir Harry\u2019s judicial frown. He was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender, barefoot donkey-girl who slipped in and out of the play, singing, like some one winding through a hilly field. He leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as Mainhall himself when, at the end of the play, she came again and again before the curtain, panting a little and flushed, her eyes dancing and her eager, nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement.", "21": "When Alexander returned to his hotel\u2014he shook Mainhall at the door of the theatre\u2014he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late before he went to bed. He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed, he had almost forgotten her. He had last written to her from Canada, after he first met Winifred, telling her that everything was changed with him\u2014that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he could; if he could not, then all the more was everything changed for him. Hilda had never replied to his letter. He felt guilty and unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really forgot Hilda altogether. When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth. After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man. One night when he and Winifred were sitting together on the bridge, he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for,\u2014one thing in particular,\u2014and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them. She considered a moment and then said \u201cNo, I think not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can\u2019t be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal things,\u201d\u2014here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a quick, impulsive gesture\u2014\u201coh, about those I should be very jealous. I should torture myself\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget. He wondered to-night, as he poured his wine, how many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years. He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her. \u201cAll the same,\u201d he lifted his glass, \u201chere\u2019s to you, little Hilda. You\u2019ve made things come your way, and I never thought you\u2019d do it.", "22": "\u201cOf course,\u201d he reflected, \u201cshe always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft. But I never thought she\u2019d do anything. She hadn\u2019t much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles. She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to. Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all. Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good. She was a daft, generous little thing. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s held her own since. After all, we were awfully young. It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly. I shouldn\u2019t wonder if she could laugh about it with me now. I shouldn\u2019t wonder\u2014 But they\u2019ve probably spoiled her, so that she\u2019d be tiresome if one met her again.\u201d", "23": "Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed."}, "CHAPTER III": {"0": "The next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine o\u2019clock he dropped in at the Duke of York\u2019s. The house was sold out and he stood through the second act. When he returned to his hotel he examined the new directory, and found Miss Burgoyne\u2019s address still given as off Bedford Square, though at a new number. He remembered that, in so far as she had been brought up at all, she had been brought up in Bloomsbury. Her father and mother played in the provinces most of the year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an old aunt who was crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage altogether. In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed to have a lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung tenaciously to such scraps and shreds of memories as were connected with it. The mummy room of the British Museum had been one of the chief delights of her childhood. That forbidding pile was the goal of her truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken there for a treat, as other children are taken to the theatre. It was long since Alexander had thought of any of these things, but now they came back to him quite fresh, and had a significance they did not have when they were first told him in his restless twenties. So she was still in the old neighborhood, near Bedford Square. The new number probably meant increased prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was snugly settled. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she would not be home for a good two hours yet, and he might as well walk over and have a look at the place. He remembered the shortest way.", "1": "It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went through Covent Garden to Oxford Street, and as he turned into Museum Street he walked more slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he approached the sullen gray mass at the end. He had not been inside the Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to meet there; sometimes to set out for gay adventures at Twickenham or Richmond, sometimes to linger about the place for a while and to ponder by Lord Elgin\u2019s marbles upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room, upon the awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought of the British Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things in the world were assembled to make one\u2019s hour of youth the more precious. One trembled lest before he got out it might somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness and see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet. How one hid his youth under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one\u2019s back upon all that vaulted cold, to take Hilda\u2019s arm and hurry out of the great door and down the steps into the sunlight among the pigeons\u2014to know that the warm and vital thing within him was still there and had not been snatched away to flush Caesar\u2019s lean cheek or to feed the veins of some bearded Assyrian king. They in their day had carried the flaming liquor, but to-day was his! So the song used to run in his head those summer mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked by the place very quietly, as if he were afraid of waking some one.", "2": "He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The house, a comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the four front windows on the second floor, where a low, even light was burning behind the white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were window boxes, painted white and full of flowers. Bartley was making a third round of the Square when he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a hansom-cab horse, driven rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was astonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve. He turned and walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda\u2019s number and stopped. The hansom must have been one that she employed regularly, for she did not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out quickly and lightly. He heard her cheerful \u201cGood-night, cabby,\u201d as she ran up the steps and opened the door with a latchkey. In a few moments the lights flared up brightly behind the white curtains, and as he walked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone too far to look up without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling that he had had a good evening, and he slept well.", "3": "For the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the office of a Scotch engineering firm on Henrietta Street, and was at work almost constantly. He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at his hotel. One afternoon, after he had tea, he started for a walk down the Embankment toward Westminster, intending to end his stroll at Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne would let him take her to the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached the Abbey, he turned back and crossed Westminster Bridge and sat down to watch the trails of smoke behind the Houses of Parliament catch fire with the sunset. The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little flickering flames; Somerset House and the bleached gray pinnacles about Whitehall were floated in a luminous haze. The yellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires. There was a smell of acacias in the air everywhere, and the laburnums were dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It was a sweet, lonely kind of summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she used to be, was doubtless more satisfactory than seeing her as she must be now\u2014and, after all, Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own young years that he was remembering?", "4": "He crossed back to Westminster, went up to the Temple, and sat down to smoke in the Middle Temple gardens, listening to the thin voice of the fountain and smelling the spice of the sycamores that came out heavily in the damp evening air. He thought, as he sat there, about a great many things: about his own youth and Hilda\u2019s; above all, he thought of how glorious it had been, and how quickly it had passed; and, when it had passed, how little worth while anything was. None of the things he had gained in the least compensated. In the last six years his reputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had been called to Japan to deliver, at the Emperor\u2019s request, a course of lectures at the Imperial University, and had instituted reforms throughout the islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but in drainage and road-making. On his return he had undertaken the bridge at Moorlock, in Canada, the most important piece of bridge-building going on in the world,\u2014a test, indeed, of how far the latest practice in bridge structure could be carried. It was a spectacular undertaking by reason of its very size, and Bartley realized that, whatever else he might do, he would probably always be known as the engineer who designed the great Moorlock Bridge, the longest cantilever in existence. Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had ever done. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was using lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had vexations enough, too, with his work at home. He had several bridges under way in the United States, and they were always being held up by strikes and delays resulting from a general industrial unrest.", "5": "Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work than he had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had never got so little out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the demands made on his time by boards of civic enterprise and committees of public welfare. The obligations imposed by his wife\u2019s fortune and position were sometimes distracting to a man who followed his profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many worthy endeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was becoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that success would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only power that was in itself another kind of restraint. He had always meant to keep his personal liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first chief, had done, and not, like so many American engineers, to become a part of a professional movement, a cautious board member, a Nestor de pontibus. He happened to be engaged in work of public utility, but he was not willing to become what is called a public man. He found himself living exactly the kind of life he had determined to escape. What, he asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and substantial comforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly; overwork had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which confronted him,\u2014of that he was afraid. He was not ready for it. It was like being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a thing possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to be free; and there was still something unconquered in him, something besides the strong work-horse that his profession had made of him. He felt rich to-night in the possession of that unstultified survival; in the light of his experience, it was more precious than honors or achievement. In all those busy, successful years there had been nothing so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness. This feeling was the only happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the only ones in which he could feel his own continuous identity\u2014feel the boy he had been in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked his way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris without a dollar in his pocket. The man who sat in his offices in Boston was only a powerful machine. Under the activities of that machine the person who, in such moments as this, he felt to be himself, was fading and dying. He remembered how, when he was a little boy and his father called him in the morning, he used to leap from his bed into the full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was Life itself. Whatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of concentrated thought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society; things that could be bought in the market. There was only one thing that had an absolute value for each individual, and it was just that original impulse, that internal heat, that feeling of one\u2019s self in one\u2019s own breast.", "6": "When Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were blinking along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars were shining in the wide sky above the river.", "7": "The next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish performance. It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find, and he got no farther than the Temple gardens and the Embankment. It was a pleasant kind of loneliness. To a man who was so little given to reflection, whose dreams always took the form of definite ideas, reaching into the future, there was a seductive excitement in renewing old experiences in imagination. He started out upon these walks half guiltily, with a curious longing and expectancy which were wholly gratified by solitude. Solitude, but not solitariness; for he walked shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy companion\u2014not little Hilda Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly dearer to him than she had ever been\u2014his own young self, the youth who had waited for him upon the steps of the British Museum that night, and who, though he had tried to pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked an arm in his.", "8": "It was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him this youth was the most dangerous of companions.", "9": "One Sunday evening, at Lady Walford\u2019s, Alexander did at last meet Hilda Burgoyne. Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there. He looked about for her rather nervously, and finally found her at the farther end of the large drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men, young and old. She was apparently telling them a story. They were all laughing and bending toward her. When she saw Alexander, she rose quickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a little to let him approach.", "10": "\u201cMr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?\u201d", "11": "Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. \u201cLong enough to have seen you more than once. How fine it all is!\u201d", "12": "She laughed as if she were pleased. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. I like it. Won\u2019t you join us here?\u201d", "13": "\u201cMiss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway last summer,\u201d Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again. Lord Westmere stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand and looked at Alexander blankly. Hilda was a good story-teller. She was sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a moment only. Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her slender, supple figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish skin and brown hair. Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her active, girlish body with its slender hips and quick, eager shoulders. Alexander heard little of the story, but he watched Hilda intently. She must certainly, he reflected, be thirty, and he was honestly delighted to see that the years had treated her so indulgently. If her face had changed at all, it was in a slight hardening of the mouth\u2014still eager enough to be very disconcerting at times, he felt\u2014and in an added air of self-possession and self-reliance. She carried her head, too, a little more resolutely.", "14": "When the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to Alexander, and the other men drifted away.", "15": "\u201cI thought I saw you in MacConnell\u2019s box with Mainhall one evening, but I supposed you had left town before this.\u201d", "16": "She looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an old friend whom she was glad to meet again.", "17": "\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been mooning about here.\u201d", "18": "Hilda laughed gayly. \u201cMooning! I see you mooning! You must be the busiest man in the world. Time and success have done well by you, you know. You\u2019re handsomer than ever and you\u2019ve gained a grand manner.\u201d", "19": "Alexander blushed and bowed. \u201cTime and success have been good friends to both of us. Aren\u2019t you tremendously pleased with yourself?\u201d", "20": "She laughed again and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cOh, so-so. But I want to hear about you. Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about the wonderful things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated you. What was it, Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun? That sounds like `The Mikado.\u2019 And what about your new bridge\u2014in Canada, isn\u2019t it, and it\u2019s to be the longest one in the world and has some queer name I can\u2019t remember.\u201d", "21": "Bartley shook his head and smiled drolly. \u201cSince when have you been interested in bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in everything? And is that a part of success?\u201d", "22": "\u201cWhy, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!\u201d Hilda exclaimed.", "23": "\u201cWell, I think we won\u2019t talk about bridges here, at any rate.\u201d Bartley looked down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug impatiently under the hem of her gown. \u201cBut I wonder whether you\u2019d think me impertinent if I asked you to let me come to see you sometime and tell you about them?\u201d", "24": "\u201cWhy should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons.\u201d", "25": "\u201cI know. Mainhall offered to take me. But you must know that I\u2019ve been in London several times within the last few years, and you might very well think that just now is a rather inopportune time\u2014\u201d", "26": "She cut him short. \u201cNonsense. One of the pleasantest things about success is that it makes people want to look one up, if that\u2019s what you mean. I\u2019m like every one else\u2014more agreeable to meet when things are going well with me. Don\u2019t you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do something that people like?\u201d", "27": "\u201cDoes it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I didn\u2019t want you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you.\u201d He spoke very seriously and looked down at the floor.", "28": "Hilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then broke into a low, amused laugh. \u201cMy dear Mr. Alexander, you have strange delicacies. If you please, that is exactly why you wish to see me. We understand that, do we not?\u201d", "29": "Bartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger about awkwardly.", "30": "Hilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her shrewd eyes. \u201cCome, don\u2019t be angry, but don\u2019t try to pose for me, or to be anything but what you are. If you care to come, it\u2019s yourself I\u2019ll be glad to see, and you thinking well of yourself. Don\u2019t try to wear a cloak of humility; it doesn\u2019t become you. Stalk in as you are and don\u2019t make excuses. I\u2019m not accustomed to inquiring into the motives of my guests. That would hardly be safe, even for Lady Walford, in a great house like this.\u201d", "31": "\u201cSunday afternoon, then,\u201d said Alexander, as she rose to join her hostess. \u201cHow early may I come?\u201d", "32": "She gave him her hand and flushed and laughed. He bent over it a little stiffly. She went away on Lady Walford\u2019s arm, and as he stood watching her yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather sullen. He felt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly."}, "CHAPTER IV": {"0": "On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne\u2019s invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea. Alexander arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon. Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his tea-cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep-set, faded eyes. He seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively. It was not very long, indeed, before his coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his hair and beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale. His dry humor went under a cloud of absent-minded kindliness which, Mainhall explained, always overtook him here. He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girl\u2019s party.", "1": "The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne. Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar. Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension. On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation. He looked very much like Agassiz, and his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and tight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of Mrs. Browning. Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their \u2018bus. They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda. \u201cShe\u2019s a dear, unworldly little thing,\u201d said the philosopher absently; \u201cmore like the stage people of my young days\u2014folk of simple manners. There aren\u2019t many such left. American tours have spoiled them, I\u2019m afraid. They have all grown very smart. Lamb wouldn\u2019t care a great deal about many of them, I fancy.\u201d", "2": "Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon. He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure. On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square. He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front.", "3": "When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs. Hilda was writing in her living-room, under the light of a tall desk lamp. Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady Walford\u2019s.", "4": "\u201cI\u2019m so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know,\u201d he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair. \u201cYes, it\u2019s very, very pretty. Every one at Lady Walford\u2019s was looking at it.\u201d", "5": "Hilda curtsied. \u201cIs that why you think it pretty? I\u2019ve no need for fine clothes in Mac\u2019s play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself. It\u2019s owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner. I don\u2019t need Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don\u2019t like English cookery.\u201d", "6": "Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.", "7": "\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is. Where did you get those etchings? They\u2019re quite unusual, aren\u2019t they?\u201d", "8": "\u201cLady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very much interested in the American artist who did them. They are all sketches made about the Villa d\u2019Este, you see. He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg.\u201d", "9": "Alexander walked over to the bookcases. \u201cIt\u2019s the air of the whole place here that I like. You haven\u2019t got anything that doesn\u2019t belong. Seems to me it looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many flowers. I like these little yellow irises.\u201d", "10": "\u201cRooms always look better by lamplight\u2014in London, at least. Though Marie is clean\u2014really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the flowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning.\u201d", "11": "\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d said Alexander simply. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you. You\u2019ve got awfully nice friends,\u201d he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk. \u201cThose fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They don\u2019t talk of any one else as they do of you.\u201d", "12": "Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: \u201cI\u2019ve a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It\u2019s not worth much, but I love it. I\u2019ve managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons. He\u2019s that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get. And I\u2019ve traveled a bit, too.\u201d", "13": "Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.", "14": "\u201cMy dining-room,\u201d Hilda explained, as she led the way, \u201cis the tiniest place you have ever seen.\u201d", "15": "It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf full of china. Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.", "16": "\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly rare,\u201d she said, \u201cbut some of it was my mother\u2019s. Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn\u2019t been stowed away. We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre\u2014queer theatres, for that matter.\u201d", "17": "It was a wonderful little dinner. There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond. He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.", "18": "\u201cI have some champagne for you, too. I don\u2019t drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it\u2019s poured. There is nothing else that looks so jolly.\u201d", "19": "\u201cThank you. But I don\u2019t like it so well as this.\u201d Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about. \u201cYou have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris much these late years?\u201d", "20": "Hilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully. \u201cOh, yes, I go over to Paris often. There are few changes in the old Quarter. Dear old Madame Anger is dead\u2014but perhaps you don\u2019t remember her?\u201d", "21": "\u201cDon\u2019t I, though! I\u2019m so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I remember how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed till ten o\u2019clock. He was the laziest fellow at the Beaux Arts; and that\u2019s saying a good deal.\u201d", "22": "\u201cWell, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect when he will work. He\u2019s a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever. But Angel\u2014do you remember Angel?\u201d", "23": "\u201cPerfectly. Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?\u201d", "24": "\u201cAh, no. Poor Angel! She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers in Madame Anger\u2019s little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and then with another soldier. Too bad! She still lives about the Quarter, and, though there is always a soldat, she has become a blanchisseuse de fin. She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and was so delighted to see me again. I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress. Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby\u2019s, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer.\u201d", "25": "Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low, happy laugh. \u201cHow jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down to the Place Saint-Michel to buy some lilacs. Do you remember how sweet they smelled?\u201d", "26": "\u201cIndeed I do. Come, we\u2019ll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke.\u201d", "27": "Hilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk, but Bartley found it pleasant to continue it.", "28": "\u201cWhat a warm, soft spring evening that was,\u201d he went on, as they sat down in the study with the coffee on a little table between them; \u201cand the sky, over the bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked on down by the river, didn\u2019t we?\u201d", "29": "Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly. He saw a gleam in her eyes that he remembered even better than the episode he was recalling.", "30": "\u201cI think we did,\u201d she answered demurely. \u201cIt was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc. I was frightened at your prodigality.\u201d", "31": "\u201cI expect it was the last franc I had. What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic. She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl. What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth. I remember it touched me so. I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could. I had enough and to spare then,\u201d Bartley mused, and looked thoughtfully at his cigar.", "32": "They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: \u201cGod give you a happy love!\u201d It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature\u2019s sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy. Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both. They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm. When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had kissed her for the first time. He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so\u2014", "33": "Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. \u201cDear me, why did you do that? I had quite forgotten\u2014I was back there. It was very jolly,\u201d he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.", "34": "Hilda laughed and went over to the piano. \u201cWell, we are neither of us twenty now, you know. Have I told you about my new play? Mac is writing one; really for me this time. You see, I\u2019m coming on.\u201d", "35": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear yellow gowns? I hope so.\u201d", "36": "He was looking at her round slender figure, as she stood by the piano, turning over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of it.", "37": "\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t a dress-up part. He doesn\u2019t seem to fancy me in fine feathers. He says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose I ought. But he\u2019s given me some good Irish songs. Listen.\u201d", "38": "She sat down at the piano and sang. When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.", "39": "\u201cSing `The Harp That Once,\u2019 Hilda. You used to sing it so well.\u201d", "40": "\u201cNonsense. Of course I can\u2019t really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!\u201d", "41": "Alexander laughed. \u201cAll the same, sing it, Hilda.\u201d", "42": "Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. \u201cIt\u2019s really too warm in this room to sing. Don\u2019t you feel it?\u201d", "43": "Alexander went over and opened the window for her. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck? Can\u2019t I get a scarf or something?\u201d", "44": "\u201cAsk a theatre lady if she\u2019s afraid of drafts!\u201d Hilda laughed. \u201cBut perhaps, as I\u2019m so warm\u2014give me your handkerchief. There, just in front.\u201d He slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps. \u201cThere, that will do. It looks like a bib.\u201d She pushed his hand away quickly and stood looking out into the deserted square. \u201cIsn\u2019t London a tomb on Sunday night?\u201d", "45": "Alexander caught the agitation in her voice. He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: \u201cIt\u2019s soft and misty. See how white the stars are.\u201d", "46": "For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke. They stood close together, looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more quickly and lightly, and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world had stopped. Suddenly he moved the clenched hand he held behind him and dropped it violently at his side. He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.", "47": "She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round. \u201cHere, take it. You must go now, Bartley. Good-night.\u201d", "48": "Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: \u201cYou are giving me a chance?\u201d", "49": "\u201cYes. Take it and go. This isn\u2019t fair, you know. Good-night.\u201d", "50": "Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides. With one he threw down the window and with the other\u2014still standing behind her\u2014he drew her back against him.", "51": "She uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his face down to hers. \u201cAre you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?\u201d she whispered."}, "CHAPTER V": {"0": "It was the afternoon of the day before Christmas. Mrs. Alexander had been driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of her friends. She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she spoke to the butler: \u201cThomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see Norah. In half an hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar and put them in the library. Mr. Alexander will be home at three to hang them himself. Don\u2019t forget the stepladder, and plenty of tacks and string. You may bring the azaleas upstairs. Take the white one to Mr. Alexander\u2019s study. Put the two pink ones in this room, and the red one in the drawing-room.\u201d", "1": "A little before three o\u2019clock Mrs. Alexander went into the library to see that everything was ready. She pulled the window shades high, for the weather was dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in the streets. A foot of snow had fallen during the morning, and the wide space over the river was thick with flying flakes that fell and wreathed the masses of floating ice. Winifred was standing by the window when she heard the front door open. She hurried to the hall as Alexander came stamping in, covered with snow. He kissed her joyfully and brushed away the snow that fell on her hair.", "2": "\u201cI wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me, Winifred. The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the pond and are skating furiously. Did the cyclamens come?\u201d", "3": "\u201cAn hour ago. What splendid ones! But aren\u2019t you frightfully extravagant?\u201d", "4": "\u201cNot for Christmas-time. I\u2019ll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall be down in a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready.\u201d", "5": "When Alexander reappeared, he took his wife\u2019s arm and went with her into the library. \u201cWhen did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the white one in my room.\u201d", "6": "\u201cI told him to put it there.\u201d", "7": "\u201cBut, I say, it\u2019s much the finest of the lot!\u201d", "8": "\u201cThat\u2019s why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room for a red one, you know.\u201d", "9": "Bartley began to sort the greens. \u201cIt looks very splendid there, but I feel piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than anywhere else in the house. Will you hand me the holly?\u201d", "10": "He climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began to twist the tough stems of the holly into the frame-work of the chandelier.", "11": "\u201cI forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning, explaining his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in Vermont has conveniently died and left Wilson a little money\u2014something like ten thousand. He\u2019s coming on to settle up the estate. Won\u2019t it be jolly to have him?\u201d", "12": "\u201cAnd how fine that he\u2019s come into a little money. I can see him posting down State Street to the steamship offices. He will get a good many trips out of that ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected him here for luncheon.\u201d", "13": "\u201cThose trains from Albany are always late. He\u2019ll be along sometime this afternoon. And now, don\u2019t you want to go upstairs and lie down for an hour? You\u2019ve had a busy morning and I don\u2019t want you to be tired to-night.\u201d", "14": "After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the greens for a few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of string, he sighed suddenly and sat down, staring out of the window at the snow. The animation died out of his face, but in his eyes there was a restless light, a look of apprehension and suspense. He kept clasping and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to realize something. The clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the afternoon outside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he first sat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself away from his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in which he sat, from everything except the wild eddies of snow above the river on which his eyes were fixed with feverish intentness, as if he were trying to project himself thither. When at last Lucius Wilson was announced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet and hurried to meet his old instructor.", "15": "\u201cHello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot of people to dinner to-night, and Winifred\u2019s lying down. You will excuse her, won\u2019t you? And now what about yourself? Sit down and tell me everything.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI think I\u2019d rather move about, if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve been sitting in the train for a week, it seems to me.\u201d Wilson stood before the fire with his hands behind him and looked about the room. \u201cYou HAVE been busy. Bartley, if I\u2019d had my choice of all possible places in which to spend Christmas, your house would certainly be the place I\u2019d have chosen. Happy people do a great deal for their friends. A house like this throws its warmth out. I felt it distinctly as I was coming through the Berkshires. I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs. Bartley again so soon.\u201d", "17": "\u201cThank you, Wilson. She\u2019ll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea now? I\u2019ll ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I always wreck the house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am quite tired. Looks as if I were not used to work, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Alexander laughed and dropped into a chair. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sailing the day after New Year\u2019s.\u201d", "18": "\u201cAgain? Why, you\u2019ve been over twice since I was here in the spring, haven\u2019t you?\u201d", "19": "\u201cOh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the hot weather more than anything else. I shan\u2019t be gone more than a month this time. Winifred and I have been up in Canada for most of the autumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on my back all the time. I never had so much trouble with a job before.\u201d Alexander moved about restlessly and fell to poking the fire.", "20": "\u201cHaven\u2019t I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about a tidewater bridge of yours in New Jersey?\u201d", "21": "\u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t amount to anything. It\u2019s held up by a steel strike. A bother, of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up with. But the Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety. You see, the truth is, we are having to build pretty well to the strain limit up there. They\u2019ve crowded me too much on the cost. It\u2019s all very well if everything goes well, but these estimates have never been used for anything of such length before. However, there\u2019s nothing to be done. They hold me to the scale I\u2019ve used in shorter bridges. The last thing a bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build.\u201d", "22": "When Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study, where he found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table.", "23": "\u201cThese pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201cand I am sure she meant them for you.\u201d", "24": "Bartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the wreaths in the windows. \u201cHave you a moment, Winifred? I have just now been thinking that this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?\u201d He went up to the table and took her hands away from the flowers, drying them with his pocket handkerchief. \u201cThey\u2019ve been awfully happy ones, all of them, haven\u2019t they?\u201d He took her in his arms and bent back, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss. \u201cYou are happy, aren\u2019t you Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you to be happy. Sometimes, of late, I\u2019ve thought you looked as if you were troubled.\u201d", "25": "\u201cNo; it\u2019s only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried, Bartley. I wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don\u2019t, always.\u201d She looked earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes.", "26": "Alexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and forth in his own, laughing his big blond laugh.", "27": "\u201cI\u2019m growing older, my dear; that\u2019s what you feel. Now, may I show you something? I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear them to-night.\u201d He took a little leather box out of his pocket and opened it. On the white velvet lay two long pendants of curiously worked gold, set with pearls. Winifred looked from the box to Bartley and exclaimed:\u2014", "28": "\u201cWhere did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?\u201d", "29": "\u201cIt\u2019s old Flemish. Isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d", "30": "\u201cThey are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear earrings.\u201d", "31": "\u201cYes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted you to. So few women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with, and a nose\u201d\u2014he waved his hand\u2014\u201cabove reproach. Most women look silly in them. They go only with faces like yours\u2014very, very proud, and just a little hard.\u201d", "32": "Winifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate springs to the lobes of her ears. \u201cOh, Bartley, that old foolishness about my being hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down now. People are beginning to come.\u201d", "33": "Bartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her. \u201cNot hard to me, Winifred,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNever, never hard to me.\u201d", "34": "Left alone, he paced up and down his study. He was at home again, among all the dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years. His house to-night would be full of charming people, who liked and admired him. Yet all the time, underneath his pleasure and hopefulness and satisfaction, he was conscious of the vibration of an unnatural excitement. Amid this light and warmth and friendliness, he sometimes started and shuddered, as if some one had stepped on his grave. Something had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except that it was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him. Sometimes it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries. Sometimes it battered him like the cannon rolling in the hold of the vessel. Always, now, it brought with it a sense of quickened life, of stimulating danger. To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he was walking the floor, after his wife left him. It seemed impossible; he could not believe it. He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her back. He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down. Going over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river. How could this happen here, in his own house, among the things he loved? What was it that reached in out of the darkness and thrilled him? As he stood there he had a feeling that he would never escape. He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead against the cold window glass, breathing in the chill that came through it. \u201cThat this,\u201d he groaned, \u201cthat this should have happened to ME!\u201d", "35": "On New Year\u2019s day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain fell. In the morning, the morning of Alexander\u2019s departure for England, the river was streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the windows of the breakfast-room. Alexander had finished his coffee and was pacing up and down. His wife sat at the table, watching him. She was pale and unnaturally calm. When Thomas brought the letters, Bartley sank into his chair and ran them over rapidly.", "36": "\u201cHere\u2019s a note from old Wilson. He\u2019s safe back at his grind, and says he had a bully time. `The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole winter fragrant.\u2019 Just like him. He will go on getting measureless satisfaction out of you by his study fire. What a man he is for looking on at life!\u201d Bartley sighed, pushed the letters back impatiently, and went over to the window. \u201cThis is a nasty sort of day to sail. I\u2019ve a notion to call it off. Next week would be time enough.\u201d", "37": "\u201cThat would only mean starting twice. It wouldn\u2019t really help you out at all,\u201d Mrs. Alexander spoke soothingly. \u201cAnd you\u2019d come back late for all your engagements.\u201d", "38": "Bartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket. \u201cI wish things would let me rest. I\u2019m tired of work, tired of people, tired of trailing about.\u201d He looked out at the storm-beaten river.", "39": "Winifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what you always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these things. Can\u2019t you remember that?\u201d", "40": "He put his arm about her. \u201cAll the same, life runs smoothly enough with some people, and with me it\u2019s always a messy sort of patchwork. It\u2019s like the song; peace is where I am not. How can you face it all with so much fortitude?\u201d", "41": "She looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much admired, which he had felt implied such high confidence and fearless pride. \u201cOh, I faced that long ago, when you were on your first bridge, up at old Allway. I knew then that your paths were not to be paths of peace, but I decided that I wanted to follow them.\u201d", "42": "Bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in the grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy Angora looked up at them curiously.", "43": "Presently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door. \u201cShall Edward bring down your trunks, sir?\u201d", "44": "\u201cYes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study table.\u201d", "45": "Thomas withdrew, closing the door softly. Bartley turned away from his wife, still holding her hand. \u201cIt never gets any easier, Winifred.\u201d", "46": "They both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside. Alexander sat down and leaned his head on his hand. His wife bent over him. \u201cCourage,\u201d she said gayly. Bartley rose and rang the bell. Thomas brought him his hat and stick and ulster. At the sight of these, the supercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted her red cushion by the fire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous indications of change. Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then plunged into his coat and drew on his gloves. His wife held his stick, smiling. Bartley smiled too, and his eyes cleared. \u201cI\u2019ll work like the devil, Winifred, and be home again before you realize I\u2019ve gone.\u201d He kissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the front door into the rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was starting his melancholy, dripping black horses. Alexander sat with his hands clenched on his knees. As the carriage turned up the hill, he lifted one hand and brought it down violently. \u201cThis time\u201d\u2014he spoke aloud and through his set teeth\u2014\u201cthis time I\u2019m going to end it!\u201d", "47": "On the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well to the stern, on the windward side where the chairs were few, his rugs over him and the collar of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears. The weather had so far been dark and raw. For two hours he had been watching the low, dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the iron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that made exercise laborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid that drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache. He seldom moved except to brush them away. The great open spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him. He intended during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion. Deep down in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and strengthening, ebbing and flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on as steadily as his pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was submerged in the vast impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals the sidelong roll of the boat measured off time like the ticking of a clock. He felt released from everything that troubled and perplexed him. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted torturing memories, had actually managed to get on board without them. He thought of nothing at all. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the grayness, it was Lucius Wilson\u2019s, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten for years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to hunt jack-rabbits with when he was a boy.", "48": "Toward six o\u2019clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and brought the swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet deck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing himself in the obliterating blackness and drowsing in the rush of the gale. Before he went below a few bright stars were pricked off between heavily moving masses of cloud.", "49": "The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander felt the need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he went on deck the sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white cloud, smoke-colored at the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water was roughish, a cold, clear indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley walked for two hours, and then stretched himself in the sun until lunch-time.", "50": "In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he walked the deck through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose continually. It was agreeable to come to himself again after several days of numbness and torpor. He stayed out until the last tinge of violet had faded from the water. There was literally a taste of life on his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of champagne. He was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than he had meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was almost deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy fur coat about his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen exhilaration. The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the shelter of the stern, the wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of warm air, a sense of close and intimate companionship. He started back and tore his coat open as if something warm were actually clinging to him beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went into the saloon parlor, full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp wind. He threw himself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and played accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had followed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He played bridge until two o\u2019clock in the morning, and managed to lose a considerable sum of money without really noticing that he was doing so.", "51": "After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently dull. When the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun did no more than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark brightness of newly cut lead. Through one after another of those gray days Alexander drowsed and mused, drinking in the grateful moisture. But the complete peace of the first part of the voyage was over. Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if driven out, and paced the deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for walking in rough weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied he must be thinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever bridge in Canada.", "52": "But Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night out, when his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been continually hammering away at himself. More and more often, when he first wakened in the morning or when he stepped into a warm place after being chilled on the deck, he felt a sudden painful delight at being nearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most despondent, when he thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a flash he was free of it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness of himself. On the instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness, the intense excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth."}, "CHAPTER VI": {"0": "The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience. He had planned to stop in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.", "1": "Emerging at Euston at half-past three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square. When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight. She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda\u2019s living-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in. She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder. \u201cOh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like this? Come over to the fire; you\u2019re chilled through.\u201d", "2": "She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.", "3": "\u201cWhen did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven\u2019t spoken a word.\u201d", "4": "\u201cI got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train.\u201d", "5": "Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze. Hilda watched him with perplexity.", "6": "\u201cThere\u2019s something troubling you, Bartley. What is it?\u201d", "7": "Bartley bent lower over the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda. You and I.\u201d", "8": "Hilda took a quick, soft breath. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.", "9": "\u201cWhat about us, Bartley?\u201d she asked in a thin voice.", "10": "He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window. At last Alexander brought out one word:\u2014", "11": "\u201cEverything!\u201d", "12": "Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright. She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley. She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.", "13": "\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,\u201d she said tremulously. \u201cI can\u2019t stand seeing you miserable.\u201d", "14": "\u201cI can\u2019t live with myself any longer,\u201d he answered roughly.", "15": "He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him. He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.", "16": "Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.", "17": "\u201cIt . . . it hasn\u2019t always made you miserable, has it?\u201d Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.", "18": "\u201cAlways. But it\u2019s worse now. It\u2019s unbearable. It tortures me every minute.\u201d", "19": "\u201cBut why NOW?\u201d she asked piteously, wringing her hands.", "20": "He ignored her question. \u201cI am not a man who can live two lives,\u201d he went on feverishly. \u201cEach life spoils the other. I get nothing but misery out of either. The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can\u2019t get at it any more. There is this deception between me and everything.\u201d", "21": "At that word \u201cdeception,\u201d spoken with such self-contempt, the color flashed back into Hilda\u2019s face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash. She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.", "22": "\u201cCould you\u2014could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?\u201d", "23": "He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire. \u201cIt was myself I was defying, Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out.\u201d", "24": "He looked at her and his haggard face softened. He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.", "25": "She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her. \u201cWhen did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?\u201d", "26": "\u201cAfter the very first. The first was\u2014sort of in play, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "27": "Hilda\u2019s face quivered, but she whispered: \u201cYes, I think it must have been. But why didn\u2019t you tell me when you were here in the summer?\u201d", "28": "Alexander groaned. \u201cI meant to, but somehow I couldn\u2019t. We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy.\u201d", "29": "\u201cYes, I was happy, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. \u201cWeren\u2019t you happy then, at all?\u201d", "30": "She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days. Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too. He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.", "31": "\u201cYes, I was then. You know. But afterward. . .\u201d", "32": "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve. \u201cPlease tell me one thing, Bartley. At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.\u201d", "33": "His hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeves. \u201cYes, Hilda; I know that,\u201d he said simply.", "34": "She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:\u2014", "35": "\u201cYou see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything. I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too. I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you. I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful\u2014to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted.\u201d", "36": "Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.", "37": "\u201cI understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I didn\u2019t know. You\u2019ve only to tell me now. What must I do that I\u2019ve not done, or what must I not do?\u201d She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair. \u201cYou want me to say it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people? I can do that.\u201d", "38": "\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said heavily.", "39": "Hilda shivered and sat still. Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can\u2019t see you at all, anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.\u201d", "40": "Hilda sprang up like a flame. She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.", "41": "\u201cNo!\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to ask that. Do you hear me, Bartley? It\u2019s too late. I won\u2019t promise. It\u2019s abominable of you to ask me. Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you? But, if you come to me, I\u2019ll do as I see fit. The shamefulness of your asking me to do that! If you come to me, I\u2019ll do as I see fit. Do you understand? Bartley, you\u2019re cowardly!\u201d", "42": "Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. \u201cYes, I know I\u2019m cowardly. I\u2019m afraid of myself. I don\u2019t trust myself any more. I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don\u2019t dare trifle with it. It\u2019s getting the better of me. It\u2019s different now. I\u2019m growing older, and you\u2019ve got my young self here with you. It\u2019s through him that I\u2019ve come to wish for you all and all the time.\u201d He took her roughly in his arms. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d", "43": "Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly. \u201cOh, Bartley, what am I to do? Why didn\u2019t you let me be angry with you? You ask me to stay away from you because you want me! And I\u2019ve got nobody but you. I will do anything you say\u2014but that! I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!\u201d", "44": "Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again. Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.", "45": "\u201cJust something Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful\u2014can I never make you understand what that means to me?\u201d She pressed his shoulders gently. \u201cYou see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different. If I\u2019d met you later, if I hadn\u2019t loved you so well\u2014but that\u2019s all over, long ago. Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding\u2014hard as a steel spring. And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference.\u201d", "46": "She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer. Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.", "47": "\u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ve tortured each other enough for tonight. Forget everything except that I am here.\u201d", "48": "\u201cI think I have forgotten everything but that already,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAh, your dear arms!\u201d"}, "CHAPTER VII": {"0": "During the fortnight that Alexander was in London he drove himself hard. He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great many men who were doing interesting things in his own profession. He disliked to think of his visits to London as holidays, and when he was there he worked even harder than he did at home.", "1": "The day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one. The thick air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a golden dawn and then fell off to a fresh breeze. When Bartley looked out of his windows from the Savoy, the river was flashing silver and the gray stone along the Embankment was bathed in bright, clear sunshine. London had wakened to life after three weeks of cold and sodden rain. Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and went over his mail while the hotel valet packed his trunks. Then he paid his account and walked rapidly down the Strand past Charing Cross Station. His spirits rose with every step, and when he reached Trafalgar Square, blazing in the sun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the bright air, he signaled to a hansom, and, before he knew what he was about, told the driver to go to Bedford Square by way of the British Museum.", "2": "When he reached Hilda\u2019s apartment she met him, fresh as the morning itself. Her rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he had been sending her. She would never let him give her anything else.", "3": "\u201cAre you busy this morning, Hilda?\u201d he asked as he sat down, his hat and gloves in his hand.", "4": "\u201cVery. I\u2019ve been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open in February, you know.\u201d", "5": "\u201cWell, then you\u2019ve worked enough. And so have I. I\u2019ve seen all my men, my packing is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening. But this morning we are going to have a holiday. What do you say to a drive out to Kew and Richmond? You may not get another day like this all winter. It\u2019s like a fine April day at home. May I use your telephone? I want to order the carriage.\u201d", "6": "\u201cOh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are telephoning I\u2019ll change my dress. I shan\u2019t be long. All the morning papers are on the table.\u201d", "7": "Hilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a broad fur hat.", "8": "Bartley rose and inspected her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear some of those pink roses?\u201d he asked.", "9": "\u201cBut they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open. I was saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!\u201d She laughed as she looked about the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sending me far too many flowers, Bartley. New ones every day. That\u2019s too often; though I do love to open the boxes, and I take good care of them.\u201d", "10": "\u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you are so fond of? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures.\u201d", "11": "Hilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass. \u201cNo, there are some things you can\u2019t do. There\u2019s the carriage. Will you button my gloves for me?\u201d", "12": "Bartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove. \u201cHow gay your eyes are this morning, Hilda.\u201d", "13": "\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been studying. It always stirs me up a little.\u201d", "14": "He pushed the top of the glove up slowly. \u201cWhen did you learn to take hold of your parts like that?\u201d", "15": "\u201cWhen I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting. What a shocking while you take.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry. We\u2019ve plenty of time.\u201d", "17": "They found all London abroad. Piccadilly was a stream of rapidly moving carriages, from which flashed furs and flowers and bright winter costumes. The metal trappings of the harnesses shone dazzlingly, and the wheels were revolving disks that threw off rays of light. The parks were full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs that leaped and yelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws.", "18": "\u201cI\u2019m not going until to-morrow, you know,\u201d Bartley announced suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll cut off a day in Liverpool. I haven\u2019t felt so jolly this long while.\u201d", "19": "Hilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad. \u201cI think people were meant to be happy, a little,\u201d she said.", "20": "They had lunch at Richmond and then walked to Twickenham, where they had sent the carriage. They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind them, toward the distant gold-washed city. It was one of those rare afternoons when all the thickness and shadow of London are changed to a kind of shining, pulsing, special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors become fluttering golden clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when all that bleakness of gray stone and dullness of dirty brick trembles in aureate light, and all the roofs and spires, and one great dome, are floated in golden haze. On such rare afternoons the ugliest of cities becomes the most poetic, and months of sodden days are offset by a moment of miracle.", "21": "\u201cIt\u2019s like that with us Londoners, too,\u201d Hilda was saying. \u201cEverything is awfully grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways of amusing ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody. We can go mad with joy, as the people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday. We make the most of our moment.\u201d", "22": "She thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and Bartley looked down at her and laughed.", "23": "\u201cYou are a plucky one, you.\u201d He patted her glove with his hand. \u201cYes, you are a plucky one.\u201d", "24": "Hilda sighed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Not about some things, at any rate. It doesn\u2019t take pluck to fight for one\u2019s moment, but it takes pluck to go without\u2014a lot. More than I have. I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she added fiercely.", "25": "After miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached London itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming up from the river, that betokened fog again to-morrow. The streets were full of people who had worked indoors all through the priceless day and had now come hungrily out to drink the muddy lees of it. They stood in long black lines, waiting before the pit entrances of the theatres\u2014short-coated boys, and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and chatting gayly. There was a blurred rhythm in all the dull city noises\u2014in the clatter of the cab horses and the rumbling of the busses, in the street calls, and in the undulating tramp, tramp of the crowd. It was like the deep vibration of some vast underground machinery, and like the muffled pulsations of millions of human hearts.", "26": "[See \u201cThe Barrel Organ by Alfred Noyes. Ed.] [I have placed it at the end for your convenience]", "27": "\u201cSeems good to get back, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Bartley whispered, as they drove from Bayswater Road into Oxford Street. \u201cLondon always makes me want to live more than any other city in the world. You remember our priestess mummy over in the mummy-room, and how we used to long to go and bring her out on nights like this? Three thousand years! Ugh!\u201d", "28": "\u201cAll the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and watched her and wished her well. I believe she used to remember,\u201d Hilda said thoughtfully.", "29": "\u201cI hope so. Now let\u2019s go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before we go home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night. Where shall I tell the driver? The Piccadilly Restaurant? The music\u2019s good there.\u201d", "30": "\u201cThere are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little French place in Soho, where we went so often when you were here in the summer? I love it, and I\u2019ve never been there with any one but you. Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely.\u201d", "31": "\u201cVery well, the sole\u2019s good there. How many street pianos there are about to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We\u2019ve had five miles of `Il Trovatore\u2019 now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are you comfy, and not too tired?\u201d", "32": "\u201cI\u2019m not tired at all. I was just wondering how people can ever die. Why did you remind me of the mummy? Life seems the strongest and most indestructible thing in the world. Do you really believe that all those people rushing about down there, going to good dinners and clubs and theatres, will be dead some day, and not care about anything? I don\u2019t believe it, and I know I shan\u2019t die, ever! You see, I feel too\u2014too powerful!\u201d", "33": "The carriage stopped. Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the pavement.

When Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her dressing-room, she found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the corridor.", "1": "\u201cThe fog\u2019s thicker than ever, Hilda. There have been a great many accidents to-day. It\u2019s positively unsafe for you to be out alone. Will you let me take you home?\u201d", "2": "\u201cHow good of you, Mac. If you are going with me, I think I\u2019d rather walk. I\u2019ve had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous.\u201d", "3": "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u201d said MacConnell dryly. Hilda pulled down her veil and they stepped out into the thick brown wash that submerged St. Martin\u2019s Lane. MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was such a savage. I hope you didn\u2019t think I made an ass of myself.\u201d", "4": "\u201cNot a bit of it. I don\u2019t wonder you were peppery. Those things are awfully trying. How do you think it\u2019s going?\u201d", "5": "\u201cMagnificently. That\u2019s why I got so stirred up. We are going to hear from this, both of us. And that reminds me; I\u2019ve got news for you. They are going to begin repairs on the theatre about the middle of March, and we are to run over to New York for six weeks. Bennett told me yesterday that it was decided.\u201d", "6": "Hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her. He was the only thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense opaqueness, as if they were walking at the bottom of the ocean.", "7": "\u201cOh, Mac, how glad I am! And they love your things over there, don\u2019t they?\u201d", "8": "\u201cShall you be glad for\u2014any other reason, Hilda?\u201d", "9": "MacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object. It proved to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the edge of the pavement.", "10": "\u201cWhat do you mean, Mac?\u201d Hilda asked nervously.", "11": "\u201cI was just thinking there might be people over there you\u2019d be glad to see,\u201d he brought out awkwardly. Hilda said nothing, and as they walked on MacConnell spoke again, apologetically: \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my knowing about it, Hilda. Don\u2019t stiffen up like that. No one else knows, and I didn\u2019t try to find out anything. I felt it, even before I knew who he was. I knew there was somebody, and that it wasn\u2019t I.\u201d", "12": "They crossed Oxford Street in silence, feeling their way.

That has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s because you seem too close to me, too much my own kind. It would be like marrying Cousin Mike, almost.

Good-night.\u201d", "18": "MacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs. Her slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire. \u201cI shall certainly see him in New York. He will see by the papers that we are coming. Perhaps he knows it already,\u201d Hilda kept thinking as she undressed. \u201cPerhaps he will be at the dock. No, scarcely that; but I may meet him in the street even before he comes to see me.\u201d Marie placed the tea-table by the fire and brought Hilda her letters. She looked them over, and started as she came to one in a handwriting that she did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice before, and he did not allow her to write to him at all. \u201cThank you, Marie. You may go now.\u201d", "19": "Hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still unopened. She looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its thickness with her fingers. She believed that she sometimes had a kind of second-sight about letters, and could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings. She put this one down on the table in front of her while she poured her tea.

Every one else is in bed and I am sitting alone in my study. I have been happier in this room than anywhere else in the world. Happiness like that makes one insolent. I used to think these four walls could stand against anything. And now I scarcely know myself here. Now I know that no one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person. Two people, when they love each other, grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but their moral natures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never welded. The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to the end.", "23": "The last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used to be with me. Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it has been as if a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all the smells of spring blew in to me. There is a garden out there, with stars overhead, where I used to walk at night when I had a single purpose and a single heart. I can remember how I used to feel there, how beautiful everything about me was, and what life and power and freedom I felt in myself. When the window opens I know exactly how it would feel to be out there. But that garden is closed to me. How is it, I ask myself, that everything can be so different with me when nothing here has changed? I am in my own house, in my own study, in the midst of all these quiet streets where my friends live. They are all safe and at peace with themselves. But I am never at peace. I feel always on the edge of danger and change.", "24": "I keep remembering locoed horses I used to see on the range when I was a boy. They changed like that. We used to catch them and put them up in the corral, and they developed great cunning. They would pretend to eat their oats like the other horses, but we knew they were always scheming to get back at the loco.", "25": "It seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world. When he tries to live a second, he develops another nature. I feel as if a second man had been grafted into me. At first he seemed only a pleasure-loving simpleton, of whose company I was rather ashamed, and whom I used to hide under my coat when I walked the Embankment, in London. But now he is strong and sullen, and he is fighting for his life at the cost of mine. That is his one activity: to grow strong. No creature ever wanted so much to live. Eventually, I suppose, he will absorb me altogether. Believe me, you will hate me then.", "26": "And what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story? Nothing at all. The little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and he became a stag. I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and because it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer. And because I suffer, Hilda. If any one I loved suffered like this, I\u2019d want to know it.

His business often called him to New York, and he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length of time. Besides his sleeping-room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a painter\u2019s studio, which he used as a study and office. It was furnished with the cast-off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings. Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror. Alexander\u2019s big work-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait-painter of international renown. He had done it for Alexander when they were students together in Paris.", "2": "Sunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously. When Alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets. It was after nine o\u2019clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap. He rose and crossed the room quickly. When he threw open the door he recognized the figure that shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway. He stood for a moment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.", "3": "\u201cCome in,\u201d he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her. He pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit down?\u201d", "4": "He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously. The yellow light from the student\u2019s lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were in the shadow. There was something about him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was.", "5": "\u201cOf course I know, Bartley,\u201d she said at last, \u201cthat after this you won\u2019t owe me the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you. That\u2019s all. Good-night; I\u2019m going now.\u201d She turned and her hand closed on the door-knob.", "6": "Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm. \u201cSit down, Hilda; you\u2019re wet through. Let me take off your coat\u2014and your boots; they\u2019re oozing water.\u201d He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank into the chair. \u201cHere, put your feet on this stool. You don\u2019t mean to say you walked down\u2014and without overshoes!\u201d", "7": "Hilda hid her face in her hands. \u201cI was afraid to take a cab. Can\u2019t you see, Bartley, that I\u2019m terribly frightened? I\u2019ve been through this a hundred times to-day. Don\u2019t be any more angry than you can help. I was all right until I knew you were in town. If you\u2019d sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything! But you won\u2019t let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home.\u201d", "8": "Alexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and began to brush the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cIs this the way you mean to answer it, Hilda?\u201d he asked unsteadily.", "9": "She was afraid to look up at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t you mean even to say goodby to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to\u2014quit me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI came to tell you that I\u2019m willing to do as you asked me. But it\u2019s no use talking about that now. Give me my things, please.\u201d She put her hand out toward the fender.", "10": "Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair. \u201cDid you think I had forgotten you were in town, Hilda? Do you think I kept away by accident? Did you suppose I didn\u2019t know you were sailing on Tuesday? There is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer. It was to have reached you on the steamer. I was all the morning writing it. I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing. Marks on paper mean something to you.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey never did to me.\u201d", "11": "Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve. \u201cOh, Bartley! Did you write to me? Why didn\u2019t you telephone me to let me know that you had? Then I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d", "12": "Alexander slipped his arm about her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it before, Hilda, on my honor I didn\u2019t, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this. I\u2019ve watched that door all day. I\u2019ve jumped up if the fire crackled. I think I have felt that you were coming.\u201d He bent his face over her hair.", "13": "\u201cAnd I,\u201d she whispered,\u2014\u201cI felt that you were feeling that. But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken.\u201d", "14": "Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.", "15": "\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t mistaken. I\u2019ve been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed.\u201d He dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees. \u201cWhat am I to do, Hilda?\u201d", "16": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I\u2019m going to do what you asked me to do when you were in London. Only I\u2019ll do it more completely. I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d", "17": "\u201cWho?\u201d", "18": "\u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I\u2019m too fond of him.\u201d", "19": "Alexander moved restlessly. \u201cAre you joking, Hilda?\u201d", "20": "\u201cIndeed I\u2019m not.\u201d", "21": "\u201cThen you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "22": "\u201cYes, I know very well. I\u2019ve thought about it a great deal, and I\u2019ve quite decided. I never used to understand how women did things like that, but I know now. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t be at the mercy of the man they love any longer.\u201d", "23": "Alexander flushed angrily. \u201cSo it\u2019s better to be at the mercy of a man you don\u2019t love?\u201d", "24": "\u201cUnder such circumstances, infinitely!\u201d", "25": "There was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander\u2019s fall. He got up and went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out. He heard Hilda moving about behind him. When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots. He went back and stood over her.", "26": "\u201cHilda you\u2019d better think a while longer before you do that. I don\u2019t know what I ought to say, but I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be happy; truly I don\u2019t. Aren\u2019t you trying to frighten me?\u201d", "27": "She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly. \u201cNo; I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019ve made up my mind to do. I suppose I would better do it without telling you. But afterward I shan\u2019t have an opportunity to explain, for I shan\u2019t be seeing you again.\u201d", "28": "Alexander started to speak, but caught himself. When Hilda rose he sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.", "29": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so much alarmed if I didn\u2019t know how utterly reckless you CAN be. Don\u2019t do anything like that rashly.\u201d His face grew troubled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be happy. You are not that kind of woman. I\u2019d never have another hour\u2019s peace if I helped to make you do a thing like that.\u201d He took her face between his hands and looked down into it. \u201cYou see, you are different, Hilda. Don\u2019t you know you are?\u201d His voice grew softer, his touch more and more tender. \u201cSome women can do that sort of thing, but you\u2014you can love as queens did, in the old time.\u201d", "30": "Hilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before. She closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled. \u201cOnly one, Bartley. Only one. And he threw it back at me a second time.\u201d", "31": "She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.", "32": "\u201cTry him again, Hilda. Try him once again.\u201d", "33": "She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands."}, "CHAPTER X": {"0": "On Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in Vermont, was standing on the siding at White River Junction when the Canadian Express pulled by on its northward journey. As the day-coaches at the rear end of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at one of the windows a man\u2019s head, with thick rumpled hair. \u201cCurious,\u201d he thought; \u201cthat looked like Alexander, but what would he be doing back there in the daycoaches?\u201d", "1": "It was, indeed, Alexander.", "2": "That morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that there was serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there at once, so he had caught the first train out of New York. He had taken a seat in a day-coach to avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and because he did not wish to be comfortable. When the telegram arrived, Alexander was at his rooms on Tenth Street, packing his bag to go to Boston. On Monday night he had written a long letter to his wife, but when morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter was still in his pocket. Winifred was not a woman who could bear disappointment. She demanded a great deal of herself and of the people she loved; and she never failed herself. If he told her now, he knew, it would be irretrievable. There would be no going back. He would lose the thing he valued most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own happiness. There would be nothing for him afterward. He seemed to see himself dragging out a restless existence on the Continent\u2014Cannes, Hyeres, Algiers, Cairo\u2014among smartly dressed, disabled men of every nationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to catch trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning with a great bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no purpose and no meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late to shorten the day.", "3": "And for what? For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he could not let go. AND HE COULD EVEN LET IT GO, he told himself. But he had promised to be in London at mid-summer, and he knew that he would go. . . . It was impossible to live like this any longer.", "4": "And this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had foreseen for him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust. And he could not understand how it had come about. He felt that he himself was unchanged, that he was still there, the same man he had been five years ago, and that he was sitting stupidly by and letting some resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life for him. This new force was not he, it was but a part of him. He would not even admit that it was stronger than he; but it was more active. It was by its energy that this new feeling got the better of him. His wife was the woman who had made his life, gratified his pride, given direction to his tastes and habits. The life they led together seemed to him beautiful. Winifred still was, as she had always been, Romance for him, and whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to her. When the grandeur and beauty of the world challenged him\u2014as it challenges even the most self-absorbed people\u2014he always answered with her name. That was his reply to the question put by the mountains and the stars; to all the spiritual aspects of life. In his feeling for his wife there was all the tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was capable. There was everything but energy; the energy of youth which must register itself and cut its name before it passes. This new feeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and light of foot. It ran and was not wearied, anticipated him everywhere. It put a girdle round the earth while he was going from New York to Moorlock. At this moment, it was tingling through him, exultant, and live as quicksilver, whispering, \u201cIn July you will be in England.\u201d", "5": "Already he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish coast, the sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train through the summer country. He closed his eyes and gave himself up to the feeling of rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts. He was sitting so, his face shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him from the siding at White River Junction.", "6": "When at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to sunset. The train was passing through a gray country and the sky overhead was flushed with a wide flood of clear color. There was a rose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows. Off to the left, under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a group of boys were sitting around a little fire. The smell of the wood smoke blew in at the window. Except for an old farmer, jogging along the highroad in his box-wagon, there was not another living creature to be seen. Alexander looked back wistfully at the boys, camped on the edge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and looking gravely at their fire. They took his mind back a long way, to a campfire on a sandbar in a Western river, and he wished he could go back and sit down with them. He could remember exactly how the world had looked then.", "7": "It was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it occurred to him that the train must be nearing Allway. In going to his new bridge at Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway. The train stopped at Allway Mills, then wound two miles up the river, and then the hollow sound under his feet told Bartley that he was on his first bridge again. The bridge seemed longer than it had ever seemed before, and he was glad when he felt the beat of the wheels on the solid roadbed again. He did not like coming and going across that bridge, or remembering the man who built it. And was he, indeed, the same man who used to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and to the stars? And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet hills sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge reaching out into the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big white house; upstairs, in Winifred\u2019s window, the light that told him she was still awake and still thinking of him. And after the light went out he walked alone, taking the heavens into his confidence, unable to tear himself away from the white magic of the night, unwilling to sleep because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time since first the hills were hung with moonlight, there was a lover in the world. And always there was the sound of the rushing water underneath, the sound which, more than anything else, meant death; the wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish. Then, in the exaltation of love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other thing as strong as love. Under the moon, under the cold, splendid stars, there were only those two things awake and sleepless; death and love, the rushing river and his burning heart.", "8": "Alexander sat up and looked about him. The train was tearing on through the darkness. All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or sleeping heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low. How came he here among all these dirty people? Why was he going to London? What did it mean\u2014what was the answer? How could this happen to a man who had lived through that magical spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars themselves were but flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of his love?", "9": "What had he done to lose it? How could he endure the baseness of life without it? And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the unquiet quicksilver in his breast told him that at midsummer he would be in London. He remembered his last night there: the red foggy darkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres, the hand-organs, the feverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the feeling of letting himself go with the crowd. He shuddered and looked about him at the poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and travel-stained, now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to stand to him for the ugliness he had brought into the world.", "10": "And those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he wished he could promise them better luck. Ah, if one could promise any one better luck, if one could assure a single human being of happiness! He had thought he could do so, once; and it was thinking of that that he at last fell asleep. In his sleep, as if it had nothing fresher to work upon, his mind went back and tortured itself with something years and years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his childhood.", "11": "When Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through pale golden ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating through the pine woods. The white birches, with their little unfolding leaves, gleamed in the lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already coming to life with their first green, a thin, bright color which had run over them like fire. As the train rushed along the trestles, thousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light. The sky was already a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal. Bartley caught up his bag and hurried through the Pullman coaches until he found the conductor. There was a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set about changing his clothes. Last night he would not have believed that anything could be so pleasant as the cold water he dashed over his head and shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on his body.", "12": "After he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into his lungs deep breaths of the pine-scented air. He had awakened with all his old sense of power. He could not believe that things were as bad with him as they had seemed last night, that there was no way to set them entirely right. Even if he went to London at midsummer, what would that mean except that he was a fool? And he had been a fool before. That was not the reality of his life. Yet he knew that he would go to London.", "13": "Half an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock. Alexander sprang to the platform and hurried up the siding, waving to Philip Horton, one of his assistants, who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the coaches. Bartley took his arm and they went together into the station buffet.", "14": "\u201cI\u2019ll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what seems to be the matter up here?\u201d", "15": "The young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation.", "16": "But Alexander cut him short. \u201cWhen did you stop work?\u201d he asked sharply.", "17": "The young engineer looked confused. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped work yet, Mr. Alexander. I didn\u2019t feel that I could go so far without definite authorization from you.\u201d", "18": "\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and ask for your authorization? You\u2019d have got it quick enough.\u201d", "19": "\u201cWell, really, Mr. Alexander, I couldn\u2019t be absolutely sure, you know, and I didn\u2019t like to take the responsibility of making it public.\u201d", "20": "Alexander pushed back his chair and rose. \u201cAnything I do can be made public, Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing strain, and that even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet you\u2019ve gone on adding weight.\u201d", "21": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here yesterday. My first telegram missed you somehow. I sent one Sunday evening, to the same address, but it was returned to me.\u201d", "22": "\u201cHave you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire.\u201d", "23": "Alexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following message to his wife:\u2014", "24": "I may have to be here for some time. Can you come up at once? Urgent.", "25": "BARTLEY.", "26": "The Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town. When they were seated in the carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant further. If it were true that the compression members showed strain, with the bridge only two thirds done, then there was nothing to do but pull the whole structure down and begin over again. Horton kept repeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong with the estimates.", "27": "Alexander grew impatient. \u201cThat\u2019s all true, Phil, but we never were justified in assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an ordinary bridge would work with anything of such length. It\u2019s all very well on paper, but it remains to be seen whether it can be done in practice. I should have thrown up the job when they crowded me. It\u2019s all nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing when you know they\u2019re not sound.\u201d", "28": "\u201cBut just now, when there is such competition,\u201d the younger man demurred. \u201cAnd certainly that\u2019s the new line of development.\u201d", "29": "Alexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.", "30": "When they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination immediately. An hour later he sent for the superintendent. \u201cI think you had better stop work out there at once, Dan. I should say that the lower chord here might buckle at any moment. I told the Commission that we were using higher unit stresses than any practice has established, and we\u2019ve put the dead load at a low estimate. Theoretically it worked out well enough, but it had never actually been tried.\u201d Alexander put on his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t look so chopfallen, Dan. It\u2019s a jolt, but we\u2019ve got to face it. It isn\u2019t the end of the world, you know. Now we\u2019ll go out and call the men off quietly. They\u2019re already nervous, Horton tells me, and there\u2019s no use alarming them. I\u2019ll go with you, and we\u2019ll send the end riveters in first.\u201d", "31": "Alexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the long span. They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was doing, as if they were on an ordinary round of inspection. When they reached the end of the river span, Alexander nodded to the superintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman. The men in the end gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each other, started back across the bridge toward the river-bank. Alexander himself remained standing where they had been working, looking about him. It was hard to believe, as he looked back over it, that the whole great span was incurably disabled, was already as good as condemned, because something was out of line in the lower chord of the cantilever arm.", "32": "The end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the tool-houses, and the second gang had picked up their tools and were starting toward the shore. Alexander, still standing at the end of the river span, saw the lower chord of the cantilever arm give a little, like an elbow bending. He shouted and ran after the second gang, but by this time every one knew that the big river span was slowly settling. There was a burst of shouting that was immediately drowned by the scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work began to pull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of tons of ironwork, all riveted together and lying in midair without support. It tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises that were like the shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of any kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own weight. It lurched neither to right nor left, but sank almost in a vertical line, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of the men jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore.", "33": "At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the downstream side of the bridge. He struck the water without injury and disappeared. He was under the river a long time and had great difficulty in holding his breath. When it seemed impossible, and his chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his wife telling him that he could hold out a little longer. An instant later his face cleared the water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had realized what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last abandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew he should live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at last, he felt sure of himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him that he had been through something of this sort before. There was nothing horrible about it. This, too, was life, and life was activity, just as it was in Boston or in London. He was himself, and there was something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural. Alexander was a strong swimmer, but he had gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the bridge itself, which had been settling faster and faster, crashed into the water behind him. Immediately the river was full of drowning men. A gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He thought he had cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching at him and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either hurt or crazed with fright. Alexander tried to beat them off, but there were too many of them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped him about the middle, and they went down together. When he sank, his wife seemed to be there in the water beside him, telling him to keep his head, that if he could hold out the men would drown and release him. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but he could not think clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered what it was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go.", "34": "The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following night. By the next morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the river, but there were still twenty missing. Many of the men had fallen with the bridge and were held down under the debris. Early on the morning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled and churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line two thirds across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and word soon spread among the crowds on the shore that its occupant was the wife of the Chief Engineer; his body had not yet been found. The widows of the lost workmen, moving up and down the bank with shawls over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked at the rusty hired hack many times that morning. They drew near it and walked about it, but none of them ventured to peer within. Even half-indifferent sightseers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: \u201cYou see that carriage over there? That\u2019s Mrs. Alexander. They haven\u2019t found him yet. She got off the train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in Boston yesterday\u2014heard the newsboys crying it in the street.\u201d", "35": "At noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a tin coffee-pot from the camp kitchen. When he reached the carriage he found Mrs. Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning, leaning forward a little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking at the river. Hour after hour she had been watching the water, the lonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed mass of iron wreckage over which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam.", "36": "\u201cThose poor women out there, do they blame him very much?\u201d she asked, as she handed the coffee-cup back to Horton.", "37": "\u201cNobody blames him, Mrs. Alexander. If any one is to blame, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s I. I should have stopped work before he came. He said so as soon as I met him. I tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram missed him, somehow. He didn\u2019t have time really to explain to me. If he\u2019d got here Monday, he\u2019d have had all the men off at once. But, you see, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never happened before. According to all human calculations, it simply couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "38": "Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not had his clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent excitement was beginning to wear off.", "39": "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don\u2019t leave me to the dread of finding out things that people may be saying. If he is blamed, if he needs any one to speak for him,\u201d\u2014for the first time her voice broke and a flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept over her rigid pallor,\u2014\u201cif he needs any one, tell me, show me what to do.\u201d She began to sob, and Horton hurried away.", "40": "When he came back at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon he was carrying his hat in his hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had found Bartley. She opened the carriage door before he reached her and stepped to the ground.", "41": "Horton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly: \u201cWon\u2019t you drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up there.\u201d", "42": "\u201cTake me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble.\u201d", "43": "The group of men down under the riverbank fell back when they saw a woman coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher. They took off their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although she had pulled her veil down over her face they did not look up at her. She was taller than Horton, and some of the men thought she was the tallest woman they had ever seen. \u201cAs tall as himself,\u201d some one whispered. Horton motioned to the men, and six of them lifted the stretcher and began to carry it up the embankment. Winifred followed them the half-mile to Horton\u2019s house. She walked quietly, without once breaking or stumbling. When the bearers put the stretcher down in Horton\u2019s spare bedroom, she thanked them and gave her hand to each in turn. The men went out of the house and through the yard with their caps in their hands. They were too much confused to say anything as they went down the hill.", "44": "Horton himself was almost as deeply perplexed. \u201cMamie,\u201d he said to his wife, when he came out of the spare room half an hour later, \u201cwill you take Mrs. Alexander the things she needs? She is going to do everything herself. Just stay about where you can hear her and go in if she wants you.\u201d", "45": "Everything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of prescience under the river. With her own hands she washed him clean of every mark of disaster. All night he was alone with her in the still house, his great head lying deep in the pillow. In the pocket of his coat Winifred found the letter that he had written her the night before he left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but because of its length, she knew it had been meant for her.", "46": "For Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled upon him consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end. His harshest critics did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have retrieved himself. Even Lucius Wilson did not see in this accident the disaster he had once foretold.", "47": "When a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say whether he did well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to be. The mind that society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable machine, dedicated to its service, may for a long time have been sick within itself and bent upon its own destruction.", "48": "Professor Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was just back from a visit to America. One afternoon, soon after his return, he put on his frock-coat and drove in a hansom to pay a call upon Hilda Burgoyne, who still lived at her old number, off Bedford Square. He and Miss Burgoyne had been fast friends for a long time. He had first noticed her about the corridors of the British Museum, where he read constantly. Her being there so often had made him feel that he would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible person, an introduction was not difficult. The preliminaries once over, they came to depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day\u2019s reading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea. They had much more in common than their memories of a common friend. Indeed, they seldom spoke of him. They saved that for the deep moments which do not come often, and then their talk of him was mostly silence. Wilson knew that Hilda had loved him; more than this he had not tried to know.", "49": "It was late when Wilson reached Hilda\u2019s apartment on this particular December afternoon, and he found her alone. She sent for fresh tea and made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people comfortable.", "50": "\u201cHow good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays without you. You\u2019ve helped me over a good many Christmases.\u201d She smiled at him gayly.", "51": "\u201cAs if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed YOU. How well you are looking, my dear, and how rested.\u201d", "52": "He peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long fingers together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with years.", "53": "Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. \u201cThat means that I was looking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn\u2019t it? Well, we must show wear at last, you know.\u201d", "54": "Wilson took the cup gratefully. \u201cAh, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries. I was most gently treated\u2014as a sort of precious relic. But, do you know, it made me feel awkward to be hanging about still.\u201d", "55": "\u201cSeventy? Never mention it to me.\u201d Hilda looked appreciatively at the Professor\u2019s alert face, with so many kindly lines about the mouth and so many quizzical ones about the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hang about for me, you know. I can\u2019t even let you go home again. You must stay put, now that I have you back. You\u2019re the realest thing I have.\u201d", "56": "Wilson chuckled. \u201cDear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the spoils of conquered cities! You\u2019ve really missed me? Well, then, I shall hang. Even if you have at last to put ME in the mummy-room with the others. You\u2019ll visit me often, won\u2019t you?\u201d", "57": "\u201cEvery day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer, where you left them.\u201d She struck a match and lit one for him. \u201cBut you did, after all, enjoy being at home again?\u201d", "58": "\u201cOh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a thousand miles apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the place. It was in Boston I lingered longest.\u201d", "59": "\u201cAh, you saw Mrs. Alexander?\u201d", "60": "\u201cOften. I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I should think. Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on. I found that I still loved to go to the house. It always seemed as if Bartley were there, somehow, and that at any moment one might hear his heavy tramp on the stairs. Do you know, I kept feeling that he must be up in his study.\u201d The Professor looked reflectively into the grate. \u201cI should really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last long talk with him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it.\u201d", "61": "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "62": "Wilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so quickly that his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and pulled them awry. \u201cWhy? Why, dear me, I don\u2019t know. She probably never thought of it.\u201d", "63": "Hilda bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what made me say that. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Go on please, and tell me how it was.\u201d", "64": "\u201cWell, it was like that. Almost as if he were there. In a way, he really is there. She never lets him go. It\u2019s the most beautiful and dignified sorrow I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s so beautiful that it has its compensations, I should think. Its very completeness is a compensation. It gives her a fixed star to steer by. She doesn\u2019t drift. We sat there evening after evening in the quiet of that magically haunted room, and watched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him. Felt him with a difference, of course.\u201d", "65": "Hilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand. \u201cWith a difference? Because of her, you mean?\u201d", "66": "Wilson\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cSomething like that, yes. Of course, as time goes on, to her he becomes more and more their simple personal relation.\u201d", "67": "Hilda studied the droop of the Professor\u2019s head intently. \u201cYou didn\u2019t altogether like that? You felt it wasn\u2019t wholly fair to him?\u201d", "68": "Wilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses. \u201cOh, fair enough. More than fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a little different from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold absolutely all of a person. And I liked him just as he was; his deviations, too; the places where he didn\u2019t square.\u201d", "69": "Hilda considered vaguely. \u201cHas she grown much older?\u201d she asked at last.", "70": "\u201cYes, and no. In a tragic way she is even handsomer. But colder. Cold for everything but him. `Forget thyself to marble\u2019; I kept thinking of that. Her happiness was a happiness a deux, not apart from the world, but actually against it. And now her grief is like that. She saves herself for it and doesn\u2019t even go through the form of seeing people much. I\u2019m sorry. It would be better for her, and might be so good for them, if she could let other people in.\u201d", "71": "\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with somebody.\u201d", "72": "Wilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm. \u201cDear me, it takes a woman to think of that, now! I don\u2019t, you know, think we ought to be hard on her. More, even, than the rest of us she didn\u2019t choose her destiny. She underwent it. And it has left her chilled. As to her not wishing to take the world into her confidence\u2014well, it is a pretty brutal and stupid world, after all, you know.\u201d", "73": "Hilda leaned forward. \u201cYes, I know, I know. Only I can\u2019t help being glad that there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people. My little Marie worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when she has come to his picture.\u201d", "74": "Wilson nodded. \u201cOh, yes! He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at the best. We shouldn\u2019t wonder too much at Mrs. Alexander.

For it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg. For eminent as, I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House. For what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.?", "26": "Well then\u2014and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten\u2014in the year 1733, George II. sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania. The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair\u2014in fact, the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind. He stayed some months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in the end, he left rather under a cloud. For he fought a duel (it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank) with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife. In that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him a pretty handful. The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife\u2014who, after another two months, bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon. This lady was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter. As for Rudolf, he went back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour\u2014with one short interval. And, finally, if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner.", "27": "That is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the lines of the \u201cPeerages\u201d.", "28": "It will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led. Well, be that as it may, I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge. I had been to a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by. I was, I believe, a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot. I could ride anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you could find, for all its flaming cover. If you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition.", "29": "\u201cThe difference between you and Robert,\u201d said my sister-in-law, who often (bless her!) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she were on one, \u201cis that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you see the opportunities of yours.\u201d", "30": "\u201cTo a man of spirit, my dear Rose,\u201d I answered, \u201copportunities are duties.\u201d", "31": "\u201cNonsense!\u201d said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on: \u201cNow, here\u2019s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to.\u201d", "32": "\u201cA thousand thanks!\u201d I murmured.", "33": "\u201cHe\u2019s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that he\u2019ll take you as an attache.

And it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and, since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country. But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which had played no small part in European history, and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in The Times that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion. At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol\u2014an old haunt of mine\u2014and propitiated Rose\u2019s wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.", "41": "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I hinted darkly, \u201cthere may be an outcome of the expedition.\u201d", "42": "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.", "43": "\u201cWell,\u201d said I carelessly, \u201cthere seems a gap that might be filled by an exhaustive work on\u2014\u201d", "44": "\u201cOh! will you write a book?\u201d she cried, clapping her hands. \u201cThat would be splendid, wouldn\u2019t it, Robert?\u201d", "45": "\u201cIt\u2019s the best of introductions to political life nowadays,\u201d observed my brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several times over.

It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the new King. He had been his father\u2019s favourite, and it had occasioned some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title derived from no less a city than the capital itself.

As George talked, I saw her glance at me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from my best. A moment later, George rejoined me.", "25": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a charming travelling companion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s poor Bert Bertrand\u2019s goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, she\u2019s going to Dresden\u2014also, no doubt, to see the pictures. It\u2019s very queer, though, that she doesn\u2019t at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.\u201d", "26": "\u201cI didn\u2019t ask to be introduced,\u201d I observed, a little annoyed.", "27": "\u201cWell, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, \u2018Another time.\u2019 Never mind, old fellow, perhaps there\u2019ll be a smash, and you\u2019ll have a chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau!\u201d", "28": "No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban. I can speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a night\u2019s rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train. Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully, but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I could do so unobserved.", "29": "As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and found in them news which affected my movements. For some reason, which was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was to take place on the next day but one. The whole country seemed in a stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged. Rooms were all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant charge for it. I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier. My train reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda.", "30": "Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train passed where I stood on the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could boast, secured apartments there. I smiled to think how surprised George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow travellers for so long.", "31": "I was very kindly received at the hotel\u2014it was really no more than an inn\u2014kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters. They were good, quiet people, and seemed very little interested in the great doings at Strelsau. The old lady\u2019s hero was the duke, for he was now, under the late King\u2019s will, master of the Zenda estates and of the Castle, which rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so from the inn. The old lady, indeed, did not hesitate to express regret that the duke was not on the throne, instead of his brother.", "32": "\u201cWe know Duke Michael,\u201d said she. \u201cHe has always lived among us; every Ruritanian knows Duke Michael. But the King is almost a stranger; he has been so much abroad, not one in ten knows him even by sight.\u201d", "33": "\u201cAnd now,\u201d chimed in one of the young women, \u201cthey say he has shaved off his beard, so that no one at all knows him.\u201d", "34": "\u201cShaved his beard!\u201d exclaimed her mother. \u201cWho says so?\u201d", "35": "\u201cJohann, the duke\u2019s keeper.

Hearing that I was bound for Strelsau, he came to see me while I was breakfasting, and told me that a sister of his who had married a well-to-do tradesman and lived in the capital, had invited him to occupy a room in her house. He had gladly accepted, but now found that his duties would not permit of his absence. He begged therefore that, if such humble (though, as he added, clean and comfortable) lodgings would satisfy me, I would take his place. He pledged his sister\u2019s acquiescence, and urged the inconvenience and crowding to which I should be subject in my journeys to and from Strelsau the next day. I accepted his offer without a moment\u2019s hesitation, and he went off to telegraph to his sister, while I packed up and prepared to take the next train. But I still hankered after the forest and the hunting-lodge, and when my little maid told me that I could, by walking ten miles or so through the forest, hit the railway at a roadside station, I decided to send my luggage direct to the address which Johann had given, take my walk, and follow to Strelsau myself. Johann had gone off and was not aware of the change in my plans; but, as its only effect was to delay my arrival at his sister\u2019s for a few hours, there was no reason for troubling to inform him of it. Doubtless the good lady would waste no anxiety on my account.", "1": "I took an early luncheon, and, having bidden my kind entertainers farewell, promising to return to them on my way home, I set out to climb the hill that led to the Castle, and thence to the forest of Zenda. Half an hour\u2019s leisurely walking brought me to the Castle. It had been a fortress in old days, and the ancient keep was still in good preservation and very imposing. Behind it stood another portion of the original castle, and behind that again, and separated from it by a deep and broad moat, which ran all round the old buildings, was a handsome modern chateau, erected by the last king, and now forming the country residence of the Duke of Strelsau. The old and the new portions were connected by a drawbridge, and this indirect mode of access formed the only passage between the old building and the outer world; but leading to the modern chateau there was a broad and handsome avenue. It was an ideal residence: when \u201cBlack Michael\u201d desired company, he could dwell in his chateau; if a fit of misanthropy seized him, he had merely to cross the bridge and draw it up after him (it ran on rollers), and nothing short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out. I went on my way, glad that poor Black Michael, though he could not have the throne or the princess, had, at least, as fine a residence as any prince in Europe.", "2": "Soon I entered the forest, and walked on for an hour or more in its cool sombre shade. The great trees enlaced with one another over my head, and the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds, and hardly bigger. I was enchanted with the place, and, finding a felled tree-trunk, propped my back against it, and stretching my legs out gave myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods and to the comfort of a good cigar. And when the cigar was finished and I had (I suppose) inhaled as much beauty as I could, I went off into the most delightful sleep, regardless of my train to Strelsau and of the fast-waning afternoon. To remember a train in such a spot would have been rank sacrilege. Instead of that, I fell to dreaming that I was married to the Princess Flavia and dwelt in the Castle of Zenda, and beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest\u2014which made a very pleasant dream. In fact, I was just impressing a fervent kiss on the charming lips of the princess, when I heard (and the voice seemed at first a part of the dream) someone exclaim, in rough strident tones.", "3": "\u201cWhy, the devil\u2019s in it! Shave him, and he\u2019d be the King!\u201d", "4": "The idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream: by the sacrifice of my heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial, I was to be transformed into a monarch! I was about to kiss the princess again, when I arrived (very reluctantly) at the conclusion that I was awake.", "5": "I opened my eyes, and found two men regarding me with much curiosity. Both wore shooting costumes and carried guns. One was rather short and very stoutly built, with a big bullet-shaped head, a bristly grey moustache, and small pale-blue eyes, a trifle bloodshot. The other was a slender young fellow, of middle height, dark in complexion, and bearing himself with grace and distinction. I set the one down as an old soldier: the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society, but not unused to military life either. It turned out afterwards that my guess was a good one.", "6": "The elder man approached me, beckoning the younger to follow. He did so, courteously raising his hat. I rose slowly to my feet.", "7": "\u201cHe\u2019s the height, too!\u201d I heard the elder murmur, as he surveyed my six feet two inches of stature. Then, with a cavalier touch of the cap, he addressed me:", "8": "\u201cMay I ask your name?\u201d", "9": "\u201cAs you have taken the first step in the acquaintance, gentlemen,\u201d said I, with a smile, \u201csuppose you give me a lead in the matter of names.\u201d", "10": "The young man stepped forward with a pleasant smile.", "11": "\u201cThis,\u201d said he, \u201cis Colonel Sapt, and I am called Fritz von Tarlenheim: we are both in the service of the King of Ruritania.\u201d", "12": "I bowed and, baring my head, answered:", "13": "\u201cI am Rudolf Rassendyll. I am a traveller from England; and once for a year or two I held a commission from her Majesty the Queen.\u201d", "14": "\u201cThen we are all brethren of the sword,\u201d answered Tarlenheim, holding out his hand, which I took readily.", "15": "\u201cRassendyll, Rassendyll!\u201d muttered Colonel Sapt; then a gleam of intelligence flitted across his face.", "16": "\u201cBy Heaven!\u201d he cried, \u201cyou\u2019re of the Burlesdons?\u201d", "17": "\u201cMy brother is now Lord Burlesdon,\u201d said I.", "18": "\u201cThy head betrayeth thee,\u201d he chuckled, pointing to my uncovered poll. \u201cWhy, Fritz, you know the story?\u201d", "19": "The young man glanced apologetically at me. He felt a delicacy which my sister-in-law would have admired. To put him at his ease, I remarked with a smile:", "20": "\u201cAh! the story is known here as well as among us, it seems.\u201d", "21": "\u201cKnown!\u201d cried Sapt. \u201cIf you stay here, the deuce a man in all Ruritania will doubt of it\u2014or a woman either.\u201d", "22": "I began to feel uncomfortable. Had I realized what a very plainly written pedigree I carried about with me, I should have thought long before I visited Ruritania. However, I was in for it now.", "23": "At this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us:", "24": "\u201cFritz, Fritz! where are you, man?\u201d", "25": "Tarlenheim started, and said hastily:", "26": "\u201cIt\u2019s the King!\u201d", "27": "Old Sapt chuckled again.", "28": "Then a young man jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood beside us. As I looked at him, I uttered an astonished cry; and he, seeing me, drew back in sudden wonder. Saving the hair on my face and a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him, saving also that he lacked perhaps half an inch\u2014nay, less than that, but still something\u2014of my height, the King of Ruritania might have been Rudolf Rassendyll, and I, Rudolf, the King.", "29": "For an instant we stood motionless, looking at one another. Then I bared my head again and bowed respectfully. The King found his voice, and asked in bewilderment:", "30": "\u201cColonel\u2014Fritz\u2014who is this gentleman?\u201d", "31": "I was about to answer, when Colonel Sapt stepped between the King and me, and began to talk to his Majesty in a low growl. The King towered over Sapt, and, as he listened, his eyes now and again sought mine. I looked at him long and carefully. The likeness was certainly astonishing, though I saw the points of difference also. The King\u2019s face was slightly more fleshy than mine, the oval of its contour the least trifle more pronounced, and, as I fancied, his mouth lacking something of the firmness (or obstinacy) which was to be gathered from my close-shutting lips. But, for all that, and above all minor distinctions, the likeness rose striking, salient, wonderful.", "32": "Sapt ceased speaking, and the King still frowned. Then, gradually, the corners of his mouth began to twitch, his nose came down (as mine does when I laugh), his eyes twinkled, and, behold! he burst into the merriest fit of irrepressible laughter, which rang through the woods and proclaimed him a jovial soul.", "33": "\u201cWell met, cousin!\u201d he cried, stepping up to me, clapping me on the back, and laughing still. \u201cYou must forgive me if I was taken aback. A man doesn\u2019t expect to see double at this time of day, eh, Fritz?\u201d", "34": "\u201cI must pray pardon, sire, for my presumption,\u201d said I. \u201cI trust it will not forfeit your Majesty\u2019s favour.\u201d", "35": "\u201cBy Heaven! you\u2019ll always enjoy the King\u2019s countenance,\u201d he laughed, \u201cwhether I like it or not; and, sir, I shall very gladly add to it what services I can.

It was a one-storey building, a sort of bungalow, built entirely of wood. As we approached it, a little man in a plain livery came out to meet us. The only other person I saw about the place was a fat elderly woman, whom I afterwards discovered to be the mother of Johann, the duke\u2019s keeper.", "56": "\u201cWell, is dinner ready, Josef?\u201d asked the King.", "57": "The little servant informed us that it was, and we soon sat down to a plentiful meal. The fare was plain enough: the King ate heartily, Fritz von Tarlenheim delicately, old Sapt voraciously. I played a good knife and fork, as my custom is; the King noticed my performance with approval.", "58": "\u201cWe\u2019re all good trenchermen, we Elphbergs,\u201d said he. \u201cBut what?\u2014we\u2019re eating dry!

Josef will look after them both later on.\u201d", "72": "Then I burst out laughing, and even old Sapt grimly smiled.", "73": "\u201cI fancy,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when Josef tells them the King is gone they\u2019ll think it is because we smelt a rat. For you may swear Black Michael doesn\u2019t expect to see him in Strelsau today.\u201d", "74": "I put the King\u2019s helmet on my head. Old Sapt handed me the King\u2019s sword, looking at me long and carefully.", "75": "\u201cThank God, he shaved his beard!\u201d he exclaimed.", "76": "\u201cWhy did he?\u201d I asked.", "77": "\u201cBecause Princess Flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously pleased to give her a cousinly kiss.

In four minutes Sapt had arrayed himself in his uniform. Josef called that the horses were ready. We jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot. The game had begun. What would the issue of it be?", "81": "The cool morning air cleared my head, and I was able to take in all Sapt said to me. He was wonderful. Fritz hardly spoke, riding like a man asleep, but Sapt, without another word for the King, began at once to instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life, of my family, of my tastes, pursuits, weaknesses, friends, companions, and servants. He told me the etiquette of the Ruritanian Court, promising to be constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom I ought to know, and give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them.", "82": "\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re a Catholic, I suppose?\u201d", "83": "\u201cNot I,\u201d I answered.", "84": "\u201cLord, he\u2019s a heretic!\u201d groaned Sapt, and forthwith he fell to a rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the Romish faith.", "85": "\u201cLuckily,\u201d said he, \u201cyou won\u2019t be expected to know much, for the King\u2019s notoriously lax and careless about such matters. But you must be as civil as butter to the Cardinal. We hope to win him over, because he and Michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence.\u201d", "86": "We were by now at the station. Fritz had recovered nerve enough to explain to the astonished station master that the King had changed his plans. The train steamed up. We got into a first-class carriage, and Sapt, leaning back on the cushions, went on with his lesson. I looked at my watch\u2014the King\u2019s watch it was, of course. It was just eight.", "87": "\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ve gone to look for us,\u201d I said.", "88": "\u201cI hope they won\u2019t find the King,\u201d said Fritz nervously, and this time it was Sapt who shrugged his shoulders.", "89": "The train travelled well, and at half-past nine, looking out of the window, I saw the towers and spires of a great city.", "90": "\u201cYour capital, my liege,\u201d grinned old Sapt, with a wave of his hand, and, leaning forward, he laid his finger on my pulse. \u201cA little too quick,\u201d said he, in his grumbling tone.", "91": "\u201cI\u2019m not made of stone!\u201d I exclaimed.", "92": "\u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d said he, with a nod. \u201cWe must say Fritz here has caught the ague. Drain your flask, Fritz, for heaven\u2019s sake, boy!\u201d", "93": "Fritz did as he was bid.", "94": "\u201cWe\u2019re an hour early,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cWe\u2019ll send word forward for your Majesty\u2019s arrival, for there\u2019ll be no one here to meet us yet. And meanwhile\u2014\u201d", "95": "\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said I, \u201cthe King\u2019ll be hanged if he doesn\u2019t have some breakfast.\u201d", "96": "Old Sapt chuckled, and held out his hand.", "97": "\u201cYou\u2019re an Elphberg, every inch of you,\u201d said he. Then he paused, and looking at us, said quietly, \u201cGod send we may be alive tonight!\u201d", "98": "\u201cAmen!\u201d said Fritz von Tarlenheim.", "99": "The train stopped. Fritz and Sapt leapt out, uncovered, and held the door for me. I choked down a lump that rose in my throat, settled my helmet firmly on my head, and (I\u2019m not ashamed to say it) breathed a short prayer to God. Then I stepped on the platform of the station at Strelsau.", "100": "A moment later, all was bustle and confusion: men hurrying up, hats in hand, and hurrying off again; men conducting me to the buffet; men mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops, to the Cathedral, to the residence of Duke Michael. Even as I swallowed the last drop of my cup of coffee, the bells throughout all the city broke out into a joyful peal, and the sound of a military band and of men cheering smote upon my ear.", "101": "King Rudolf the Fifth was in his good city of Strelsau! And they shouted outside\u2014", "102": "\u201cGod save the King!\u201d", "103": "Old Sapt\u2019s mouth wrinkled into a smile.", "104": "\u201cGod save \u2018em both!\u201d he whispered. \u201cCourage, lad!\u201d and I felt his hand press my knee."}, "CHAPTER 5": {"0": "With Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt close behind me, I stepped out of the buffet on to the platform. The last thing I did was to feel if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard. A gay group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting me, at their head a tall old man, covered with medals, and of military bearing. He wore the yellow and red ribbon of the Red Rose of Ruritania\u2014which, by the way, decorated my unworthy breast also.", "1": "\u201cMarshal Strakencz,\u201d whispered Sapt, and I knew that I was in the presence of the most famous veteran of the Ruritanian army.", "2": "Just behind the Marshal stood a short spare man, in flowing robes of black and crimson.", "3": "\u201cThe Chancellor of the Kingdom,\u201d whispered Sapt.", "4": "The Marshal greeted me in a few loyal words, and proceeded to deliver an apology from the Duke of Strelsau. The duke, it seemed, had been afflicted with a sudden indisposition which made it impossible for him to come to the station, but he craved leave to await his Majesty at the Cathedral. I expressed my concern, accepted the Marshal\u2019s excuses very suavely, and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished personages. No one betrayed the least suspicion, and I felt my nerve returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding. But Fritz was still pale, and his hand shook like a leaf as he extended it to the Marshal.", "5": "Presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the station. Here I mounted my horse, the Marshal holding my stirrup. The civil dignitaries went off to their carriages, and I started to ride through the streets with the Marshal on my right and Sapt (who, as my chief aide-de-camp, was entitled to the place) on my left. The city of Strelsau is partly old and partly new. Spacious modern boulevards and residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow, tortuous, and picturesque streets of the original town. In the outer circles the upper classes live; in the inner the shops are situated; and, behind their prosperous fronts, lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys, filled with a poverty-stricken, turbulent, and (in large measure) criminal class. These social and local divisions corresponded, as I knew from Sapt\u2019s information, to another division more important to me. The New Town was for the King; but to the Old Town Michael of Strelsau was a hope, a hero, and a darling.", "6": "The scene was very brilliant as we passed along the Grand Boulevard and on to the great square where the Royal Palace stood. Here I was in the midst of my devoted adherents. Every house was hung with red and bedecked with flags and mottoes. The streets were lined with raised seats on each side, and I passed along, bowing this way and that, under a shower of cheers, blessings, and waving handkerchiefs. The balconies were full of gaily dressed ladies, who clapped their hands and curtsied and threw their brightest glances at me. A torrent of red roses fell on me; one bloom lodged in my horse\u2019s mane, and I took it and stuck it in my coat. The Marshal smiled grimly. I had stolen some glances at his face, but he was too impassive to show me whether his sympathies were with me or not.", "7": "\u201cThe red rose for the Elphbergs, Marshal,\u201d said I gaily, and he nodded.", "8": "I have written \u201cgaily,\u201d and a strange word it must seem. But the truth is, that I was drunk with excitement. At that moment I believed\u2014I almost believed\u2014that I was in very truth the King; and, with a look of laughing triumph, I raised my eyes to the beauty-laden balconies again . . . and then I started. For, looking down on me, with her handsome face and proud smile, was the lady who had been my fellow traveller\u2014Antoinette de Mauban; and I saw her also start, and her lips moved, and she leant forward and gazed at me. And I, collecting myself, met her eyes full and square, while again I felt my revolver. Suppose she had cried aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s not the King!\u201d", "9": "Well, we went by; and then the Marshal, turning round in his saddle, waved his hand, and the Cuirassiers closed round us, so that the crowd could not come near me. We were leaving my quarter and entering Duke Michael\u2019s, and this action of the Marshal\u2019s showed me more clearly than words what the state of feeling in the town must be. But if Fate made me a King, the least I could do was to play the part handsomely.", "10": "\u201cWhy this change in our order, Marshal?\u201d said I.", "11": "The Marshal bit his white moustache.", "12": "\u201cIt is more prudent, sire,\u201d he murmured.", "13": "I drew rein.", "14": "\u201cLet those in front ride on,\u201d said I, \u201ctill they are fifty yards ahead. But do you, Marshal, and Colonel Sapt and my friends, wait here till I have ridden fifty yards. And see that no one is nearer to me. I will have my people see that their King trusts them.\u201d", "15": "Sapt laid his hand on my arm. I shook him off. The Marshal hesitated.", "16": "\u201cAm I not understood?\u201d said I; and, biting his moustache again, he gave the orders. I saw old Sapt smiling into his beard, but he shook his head at me. If I had been killed in open day in the streets of Strelsau, Sapt\u2019s position would have been a difficult one.", "17": "Perhaps I ought to say that I was dressed all in white, except my boots. I wore a silver helmet with gilt ornaments, and the broad ribbon of the Rose looked well across my chest. I should be paying a poor compliment to the King if I did not set modesty aside and admit that I made a very fine figure. So the people thought; for when I, riding alone, entered the dingy, sparsely decorated, sombre streets of the Old Town, there was first a murmur, then a cheer, and a woman, from a window above a cookshop, cried the old local saying:", "18": "\u201cIf he\u2019s red, he\u2019s right!\u201d whereat I laughed and took off my helmet that she might see that I was of the right colour and they cheered me again at that.", "19": "It was more interesting riding thus alone, for I heard the comments of the crowd.", "20": "\u201cHe looks paler than his wont,\u201d said one.", "21": "\u201cYou\u2019d look pale if you lived as he does,\u201d was the highly disrespectful retort.", "22": "\u201cHe\u2019s a bigger man than I thought,\u201d said another.", "23": "\u201cSo he had a good jaw under that beard after all,\u201d commented a third.", "24": "\u201cThe pictures of him aren\u2019t handsome enough,\u201d declared a pretty girl, taking great care that I should hear. No doubt it was mere flattery.", "25": "But, in spite of these signs of approval and interest, the mass of the people received me in silence and with sullen looks, and my dear brother\u2019s portrait ornamented most of the windows\u2014which was an ironical sort of greeting to the King. I was quite glad that he had been spared the unpleasant sight. He was a man of quick temper, and perhaps he would not have taken it so placidly as I did.", "26": "At last we were at the Cathedral. Its great grey front, embellished with hundreds of statues and boasting a pair of the finest oak doors in Europe, rose for the first time before me, and the sudden sense of my audacity almost overcame me. Everything was in a mist as I dismounted. I saw the Marshal and Sapt dimly, and dimly the throng of gorgeously robed priests who awaited me. And my eyes were still dim as I walked up the great nave, with the pealing of the organ in my ears. I saw nothing of the brilliant throng that filled it, I hardly distinguished the stately figure of the Cardinal as he rose from the archiepiscopal throne to greet me. Two faces only stood out side by side clearly before my eyes\u2014the face of a girl, pale and lovely, surmounted by a crown of the glorious Elphberg hair (for in a woman it is glorious), and the face of a man, whose full-blooded red cheeks, black hair, and dark deep eyes told me that at last I was in presence of my brother, Black Michael. And when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment, and his helmet fell with a clatter on the floor. Till that moment I believe that he had not realized that the King was in very truth come to Strelsau.", "27": "Of what followed next I remember nothing. I knelt before the altar and the Cardinal anointed my head. Then I rose to my feet, and stretched out my hand and took from him the crown of Ruritania and set it on my head, and I swore the old oath of the King; and (if it were a sin, may it be forgiven me) I received the Holy Sacrament there before them all. Then the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room. The portrait of the King is very good.", "28": "Then the lady with the pale face and the glorious hair, her train held by two pages, stepped from her place and came to where I stood. And a herald cried:", "29": "\u201cHer Royal Highness the Princess Flavia!\u201d", "30": "She curtsied low, and put her hand under mine and raised my hand and kissed it. And for an instant I thought what I had best do. Then I drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek, and she blushed red, and\u2014then his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop slipped in front of Black Michael, and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the Pope\u2014the first and last which I have received from that exalted quarter!", "31": "And then came the Duke of Strelsau. His step trembled, I swear, and he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched. And I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the cheek. I think we were both glad when that was over!", "32": "But neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did I see the least doubt or questioning. Yet, had I and the King stood side by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little consideration. But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that I could be other than the King. So the likeness served, and for an hour I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor Square I had danced a score of times.

One was a magnificent bay, up to any weight; the other a sturdy brown. Sapt signed to me to mount the bay. Without a word to the man, we mounted and rode away. The town was full of noise and merriment, but we took secluded ways. My cloak was wrapped over half my face; the capacious flat cap hid every lock of my tell-tale hair. By Sapt\u2019s directions, I crouched on my saddle, and rode with such a round back as I hope never to exhibit on a horse again. Down a long narrow lane we went, meeting some wanderers and some roisterers; and, as we rode, we heard the Cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to the King. It was half-past six, and still light. At last we came to the city wall and to a gate.", "31": "\u201cHave your weapon ready,\u201d whispered Sapt. \u201cWe must stop his mouth, if he talks.\u201d", "32": "I put my hand on my revolver.

Away, far behind us, in the still of the evening\u2014it was just half-past nine\u2014we heard the beat of horses\u2019 hoofs. The wind blowing strong behind us, carried the sound. I glanced at Sapt.", "47": "\u201cCome on!\u201d he cried, and spurred his horse into a gallop. When we next paused to listen, the hoof-beats were not audible, and we relaxed our pace.

The moon shone out now clear and full, so that the road was white with it. The ground was hard, and we had left no traces.", "58": "\u201cHere they come!\u201d whispered Sapt.", "59": "\u201cIt\u2019s the duke!\u201d", "60": "\u201cI thought so,\u201d he answered.", "61": "It was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who had cause to know me afterwards\u2014Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper, and body-servant to his Highness. They were up to us: the duke reined up. I saw Sapt\u2019s finger curl lovingly towards the trigger. I believe he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a farmyard. I laid my hand on his arm.

Then he cried:", "71": "\u201cTo Zenda, then!\u201d and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.", "72": "Sapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out laughing.", "73": "For ten minutes we stayed where we were.", "74": "\u201cYou see,\u201d said Sapt, \u201cthey\u2019ve sent him news that all is well.\u201d", "75": "\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.", "76": "\u201cGod knows,\u201d said Sapt, frowning heavily. \u201cBut it\u2019s brought him from Strelsau in a rare puzzle.\u201d", "77": "Then we mounted, and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their feet to the ground. For those last eight miles we spoke no more. Our minds were full of apprehension. \u201cAll is well.\u201d What did it mean? Was all well with the King?", "78": "At last the lodge came in sight. Spurring our horses to a last gallop, we rode up to the gate. All was still and quiet. Not a soul came to meet us. We dismounted in haste. Suddenly Sapt caught me by the arm.", "79": "\u201cLook there!\u201d he said, pointing to the ground.", "80": "I looked down. At my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs, torn and slashed and rent.

Afraid for himself he was not\u2014no man ever saw him that; but to think what might lie in that dark cellar was enough to turn any man\u2019s face pale. I went myself, and took a silver candlestick from the dining-table and struck a light, and, as I returned, I felt the hot wax drip on my naked hand as the candle swayed to and fro; so that I cannot afford to despise Colonel Sapt for his agitation.", "95": "I came to the door of the cellar. The red stain turning more and more to a dull brown, stretched inside. I walked two yards into the cellar, and held the candle high above my head. I saw the full bins of wine; I saw spiders crawling on the walls; I saw, too, a couple of empty bottles lying on the floor; and then, away in the corner, I saw the body of a man, lying flat on his back, with his arms stretched wide, and a crimson gash across his throat. I walked to him and knelt down beside him, and commended to God the soul of a faithful man.

Then I found myself opposite a big man, and I was half conscious of another to my right. It was too warm to stay, and with a simultaneous action I drove my spurs into my horse again and my sword full into the big man\u2019s breast. His bullet whizzed past my ear\u2014I could almost swear it touched it. I wrenched at the sword, but it would not come, and I dropped it and galloped after Sapt, whom I now saw about twenty yards ahead. I waved my hand in farewell, and dropped it a second later with a yell, for a bullet had grazed my finger and I felt the blood. Old Sapt turned round in the saddle.

We found a farmer just up, and made him give us sustenance for ourselves and our horses. I, feigning a toothache, muffled my face closely. Then ahead again, till Strelsau lay before us. It was eight o\u2019clock or nearing nine, and the gates were all open, as they always were save when the duke\u2019s caprice or intrigues shut them. We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before, all four of us\u2014the men and the horses\u2014wearied and jaded.

Then came the Chancellor, for another three hours; and to him I had to explain that the hurt to my finger (we turned that bullet to happy account) prevented me from writing\u2014whence arose great to-do, hunting of precedents and so forth, ending in my \u201cmaking my mark,\u201d and the Chancellor attesting it with a superfluity of solemn oaths.

This step created much interest, and was met with shouts of approval. The princess was very popular, and the Chancellor himself had not scrupled to hint to me that the more I pressed my suit, and the more rapidly I brought it to a prosperous conclusion, the stronger should I be in the affection of my subjects. The Chancellor, of course, did not understand the difficulties which lay in the way of following his loyal and excellent advice. However, I thought I could do no harm by calling; and in this view Fritz supported me with a cordiality that surprised me, until he confessed that he also had his motives for liking a visit to the princess\u2019s house, which motive was no other than a great desire to see the princess\u2019s lady-in-waiting and bosom friend, the Countess Helga von Strofzin.", "33": "Etiquette seconded Fritz\u2019s hopes.

I had to keep the princess devoted to me\u2014and yet indifferent to me: I had to show affection for her\u2014and not feel it. I had to make love for another, and that to a girl who\u2014princess or no princess\u2014was the most beautiful I had ever seen.

And finally listen to this: \u2018The state of feeling in the city is not satisfactory. The King is much criticized\u2019 (you know, he\u2019s told to be quite frank) \u2018for taking no steps about his marriage. From enquiries among the entourage of the Princess Flavia, her Royal Highness is believed to be deeply offended by the remissness of his Majesty. The common people are coupling her name with that of the Duke of Strelsau, and the duke gains much popularity from the suggestion.\u2019 I have caused the announcement that the King gives a ball tonight in honour of the princess to be widely diffused, and the effect is good.\u201d", "9": "\u201cThat is news to me,\u201d said I.", "10": "\u201cOh, the preparations are all made!\u201d laughed Fritz. \u201cI\u2019ve seen to that.\u201d", "11": "Sapt turned to me and said, in a sharp, decisive voice:", "12": "\u201cYou must make love to her tonight, you know.\u201d", "13": "\u201cI think it is very likely I shall, if I see her alone,\u201d said I. \u201cHang it, Sapt, you don\u2019t suppose I find it difficult?\u201d", "14": "Fritz whistled a bar or two; then he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll find it only too easy. Look here, I hate telling you this, but I must. The Countess Helga told me that the princess had become most attached to the King. Since the coronation, her feelings have undergone a marked development. It\u2019s quite true that she is deeply wounded by the King\u2019s apparent neglect.\u201d", "15": "\u201cHere\u2019s a kettle of fish!\u201d I groaned.", "16": "\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Sapt. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve made pretty speeches to a girl before now? That\u2019s all she wants.\u201d", "17": "Fritz, himself a lover, understood better my distress. He laid his hand on my shoulder, but said nothing.", "18": "\u201cI think, though,\u201d pursued that cold-blooded old Sapt, \u201cthat you\u2019d better make your offer tonight.\u201d", "19": "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d", "20": "\u201cOr, any rate, go near it: and I shall send a \u2018semi-official\u2019 to the papers.\u201d", "21": "\u201cI\u2019ll do nothing of the sort\u2014no more will you!\u201d said I. \u201cI utterly refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess.\u201d", "22": "Sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes. A slow cunning smile passed over his face.", "23": "\u201cAll right, lad, all right,\u201d said he. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t press you too hard. Soothe her down a bit, if you can, you know.

His rough manner covered a wonderful tact\u2014and as I came to recognize more and more, a remarkable knowledge of human nature. Why did he urge me so little about the princess? Because he knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his arguments\u2014and that the less I thought about the thing, the more likely was I to do it. He must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the princess; but that went for nothing with him. Can I say, confidently, that he was wrong? If the King were restored, the princess must turn to him, either knowing or not knowing the change. And if the King were not restored to us? It was a subject that we had never yet spoken of. But I had an idea that, in such a case, Sapt meant to seat me on the throne of Ruritania for the term of my life. He would have set Satan himself there sooner than that pupil of his, Black Michael.", "26": "The ball was a sumptuous affair. I opened it by dancing a quadrille with Flavia: then I waltzed with her. Curious eyes and eager whispers attended us. We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my stammered sentences\u2014I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd, and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled badge round her neck. In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning. The rest of the meal passed in silence; neither Flavia nor I could speak. Fritz touched me on the shoulder, and I rose, gave her my arm, and walked down the hall into a little room, where coffee was served to us. The gentlemen and ladies in attendance withdrew, and we were alone.", "27": "The little room had French windows opening on the gardens. The night was fine, cool, and fragrant. Flavia sat down, and I stood opposite her. I was struggling with myself: if she had not looked at me, I believe that even then I should have won my fight. But suddenly, involuntarily, she gave me one brief glance\u2014a glance of question, hurriedly turned aside; a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek, and she caught her breath. Ah, if you had seen her! I forgot the King in Zenda. I forgot the King in Strelsau. She was a princess\u2014and I an impostor. Do you think I remembered that? I threw myself on my knee and seized her hands in mine. I said nothing. Why should I? The soft sounds of the night set my wooing to a wordless melody, as I pressed my kisses on her lips.", "28": "She pushed me from her, crying suddenly:", "29": "\u201cAh! is it true? or is it only because you must?\u201d", "30": "\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d I said, in low smothered tones\u2014\u201ctrue that I love you more than life\u2014or truth\u2014or honour!\u201d", "31": "She set no meaning to my words, treating them as one of love\u2019s sweet extravagances.

A little cry burst from Flavia, as she sprang back from me. My half-finished sentence died on my lips. Sapt stood there, bowing low, but with a stern frown on his face.", "57": "\u201cA thousand pardons, sire,\u201d said he, \u201cbut his Eminence the Cardinal has waited this quarter of an hour to offer his respectful adieu to your Majesty.\u201d", "58": "I met his eye full and square; and I read in it an angry warning.

She said nothing, but no man could have missed her meaning, who had ever seen a woman in the exultation of love. A sour, yet sad, smile passed over the old soldier\u2019s face, and there was tenderness in his voice, as bending to kiss her hand, he said:", "61": "\u201cIn joy and sorrow, in good times and bad, God save your Royal Highness!\u201d", "62": "He paused and added, glancing at me and drawing himself up to military erectness:", "63": "\u201cBut, before all comes the King\u2014God save the King!\u201d", "64": "And Flavia caught at my hand and kissed it, murmuring:", "65": "\u201cAmen! Good God, Amen!\u201d", "66": "We went into the ballroom again. Forced to receive adieus, I was separated from Flavia: everyone, when they left me, went to her. Sapt was out and in of the throng, and where he had been, glances, smiles, and whispers were rife. I doubted not that, true to his relentless purpose, he was spreading the news that he had learnt. To uphold the Crown and beat Black Michael\u2014that was his one resolve. Flavia, myself\u2014ay, and the real King in Zenda, were pieces in his game; and pawns have no business with passions. Not even at the walls of the Palace did he stop; for when at last I handed Flavia down the broad marble steps and into her carriage, there was a great crowd awaiting us, and we were welcomed with deafening cheers. What could I do? Had I spoken then, they would have refused to believe that I was not the King; they might have believed that the King had run mad. By Sapt\u2019s devices and my own ungoverned passion I had been forced on, and the way back had closed behind me; and the passion still drove me in the same direction as the devices seduced me. I faced all Strelsau that night as the King and the accepted suitor of the Princess Flavia.", "67": "At last, at three in the morning, when the cold light of dawning day began to steal in, I was in my dressing-room, and Sapt alone was with me. I sat like a man dazed, staring into the fire; he puffed at his pipe; Fritz was gone to bed, having almost refused to speak to me. On the table by me lay a rose; it had been in Flavia\u2019s dress, and, as we parted, she had kissed it and given it to me.", "68": "Sapt advanced his hand towards the rose, but, with a quick movement, I shut mine down upon it.", "69": "\u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d I said, \u201cnot yours\u2014nor the King\u2019s either.\u201d", "70": "\u201cWe struck a good blow for the King tonight,\u201d said he.", "71": "I turned on him fiercely.", "72": "\u201cWhat\u2019s to prevent me striking a blow for myself?\u201d I said.", "73": "He nodded his head.", "74": "\u201cI know what\u2019s in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, lad; but you\u2019re bound in honour.\u201d", "75": "\u201cHave you left me any honour?\u201d", "76": "\u201cOh, come, to play a little trick on a girl\u2014\u201d", "77": "\u201cYou can spare me that.

Ah! but a man cannot be held to write down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them. Yet, unless he sets up as a saint, he need not hate himself for them. He is better employed, as it humbly seems to me, in giving thanks that power to resist was vouchsafed to him, than in fretting over wicked impulses which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the weakness of our nature.", "1": "It was a fine bright morning when I walked, unattended, to the princess\u2019s house, carrying a nosegay in my hand.

I found Fritz\u2019s inamorata, the Countess Helga, gathering blooms in the garden for her mistress\u2019s wear, and prevailed on her to take mine in their place.

As evening fell, I drove through the busy streets to Flavia\u2019s residence. I was recognized as I went and heartily cheered. I played my part, and made shift to look the happy lover.

And his figure\u2014the lithe, buoyant figure I had met in the woods of Zenda\u2014the dull, inert mass I had left in the cellar of the hunting-lodge\u2014seemed to rise, double-shaped, before me, and to come between us, thrusting itself in even where she lay, pale, exhausted, fainting, in my arms, and yet looking up at me with those eyes that bore such love as I have never seen, and haunt me now, and will till the ground closes over me\u2014and (who knows?) perhaps beyond."}, "CHAPTER 12": {"0": "About five miles from Zenda\u2014on the opposite side from that on which the Castle is situated, there lies a large tract of wood. It is rising ground, and in the centre of the demesne, on the top of the hill, stands a fine modern chateau, the property of a distant kinsman of Fritz\u2019s, the Count Stanislas von Tarlenheim. Count Stanislas himself was a student and a recluse. He seldom visited the house, and had, on Fritz\u2019s request, very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and my party. This, then, was our destination; chosen ostensibly for the sake of the boar-hunting (for the wood was carefully preserved, and boars, once common all over Ruritania, were still to be found there in considerable numbers), really because it brought us within striking distance of the Duke of Strelsau\u2019s more magnificent dwelling on the other side of the town. A large party of servants, with horses and luggage, started early in the morning; we followed at midday, travelling by train for thirty miles, and then mounting our horses to ride the remaining distance to the chateau.", "1": "We were a gallant party. Besides Sapt and Fritz, I was accompanied by ten gentlemen: every one of them had been carefully chosen, and no less carefully sounded, by my two friends, and all were devotedly attached to the person of the King. They were told a part of the truth; the attempt on my life in the summer-house was revealed to them, as a spur to their loyalty and an incitement against Michael. They were also informed that a friend of the King\u2019s was suspected to be forcibly confined within the Castle of Zenda. His rescue was one of the objects of the expedition; but, it was added, the King\u2019s main desire was to carry into effect certain steps against his treacherous brother, as to the precise nature of which they could not at present be further enlightened. Enough that the King commanded their services, and would rely on their devotion when occasion arose to call for it. Young, well-bred, brave, and loyal, they asked no more: they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience, and prayed for a fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it.", "2": "Thus the scene was shifted from Strelsau to the chateau of Tarlenheim and Castle of Zenda, which frowned at us across the valley. I tried to shift my thoughts also, to forget my love, and to bend all my energies to the task before me. It was to get the King out of the Castle alive. Force was useless: in some trick lay the chance; and I had already an inkling of what we must do. But I was terribly hampered by the publicity which attended my movements. Michael must know by now of my expedition; and I knew Michael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by the feint of the boar-hunt. He would understand very well what the real quarry was. That, however, must be risked\u2014that and all it might mean; for Sapt, no less than myself, recognized that the present state of things had become unendurable. And there was one thing that I dared to calculate on\u2014not, as I now know, without warrant. It was this\u2014that Black Michael would not believe that I meant well by the King. He could not appreciate\u2014I will not say an honest man, for the thoughts of my own heart have been revealed\u2014but a man acting honestly. He saw my opportunity as I had seen it, as Sapt had seen it; he knew the princess\u2014nay (and I declare that a sneaking sort of pity for him invaded me), in his way he loved her; he would think that Sapt and Fritz could be bribed, so the bribe was large enough. Thinking thus, would he kill the King, my rival and my danger? Ay, verily, that he would, with as little compunction as he would kill a rat. But he would kill Rudolf Rassendyll first, if he could; and nothing but the certainty of being utterly damned by the release of the King alive and his restoration to the throne would drive him to throw away the trump card which he held in reserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor Rassendyll. Musing on all this as I rode along, I took courage.", "3": "Michael knew of my coming, sure enough. I had not been in the house an hour, when an imposing Embassy arrived from him. He did not quite reach the impudence of sending my would-be assassins, but he sent the other three of his famous Six\u2014the three Ruritanian gentlemen\u2014Lauengram, Krafstein, and Rupert Hentzau. A fine, strapping trio they were, splendidly horsed and admirably equipped. Young Rupert, who looked a dare-devil, and could not have been more than twenty-two or twenty-three, took the lead, and made us the neatest speech, wherein my devoted subject and loving brother Michael of Strelsau, prayed me to pardon him for not paying his addresses in person, and, further, for not putting his Castle at my disposal; the reason for both of these apparent derelictions being that he and several of his servants lay sick of scarlet fever, and were in a very sad, and also a very infectious state. So declared young Rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip and a toss of his thick hair\u2014he was a handsome villain, and the gossip ran that many a lady had troubled her heart for him already.", "4": "\u201cIf my brother has scarlet fever,\u201d said I, \u201che is nearer my complexion than he is wont to be, my lord. I trust he does not suffer?\u201d", "5": "\u201cHe is able to attend to his affairs, sire.\u201d", "6": "\u201cI hope all beneath your roof are not sick. What of my good friends, De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard? I heard the last had suffered a hurt.\u201d", "7": "Lauengram and Krafstein looked glum and uneasy, but young Rupert\u2019s smile grew broader.", "8": "\u201cHe hopes soon to find a medicine for it, sire,\u201d he answered.", "9": "And I burst out laughing, for I knew what medicine Detchard longed for\u2014it is called Revenge.", "10": "\u201cYou will dine with us, gentlemen?\u201d I asked.", "11": "Young Rupert was profuse in apologies. They had urgent duties at the Castle.", "12": "\u201cThen,\u201d said I, with a wave of my hand, \u201cto our next meeting, gentlemen. May it make us better acquainted.\u201d", "13": "\u201cWe will pray your Majesty for an early opportunity,\u201d quoth Rupert airily; and he strode past Sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that I saw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night.", "14": "For my part, if a man must needs be a knave, I would have him a debonair knave, and I liked Rupert Hentzau better than his long-faced, close-eyed companions. It makes your sin no worse, as I conceive, to do it a la mode and stylishly.", "15": "Now it was a curious thing that on this first night, instead of eating the excellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me, I must needs leave my gentlemen to eat it alone, under Sapt\u2019s presiding care, and ride myself with Fritz to the town of Zenda and a certain little inn that I knew of. There was little danger in the excursion; the evenings were long and light, and the road this side of Zenda well frequented. So off we rode, with a groom behind us. I muffled myself up in a big cloak.", "16": "\u201cFritz,\u201d said I, as we entered the town, \u201cthere\u2019s an uncommonly pretty girl at this inn.\u201d", "17": "\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked.", "18": "\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been there,\u201d said I.", "19": "\u201cSince\u2014?\u201d he began.", "20": "\u201cNo. Before,\u201d said I.", "21": "\u201cBut they\u2019ll recognize you?\u201d", "22": "\u201cWell, of course they will.

The other will order a private room and dinner, and, further, a bottle of the best wine for the sufferer.

But he offers you safe-conduct across the frontier and a million crowns.\u201d", "17": "\u201cI prefer your offer, my lord, if I am bound to one.\u201d", "18": "\u201cYou refuse?\u201d", "19": "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "20": "\u201cI told Michael you would;\u201d and the villain, his temper restored, gave me the sunniest of smiles. \u201cThe fact is, between ourselves,\u201d he continued, \u201cMichael doesn\u2019t understand a gentleman.\u201d", "21": "I began to laugh.", "22": "\u201cAnd you?\u201d I asked.", "23": "\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, well, the halter be it.\u201d", "24": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t live to see it,\u201d I observed.", "25": "\u201cHas his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on me?\u201d", "26": "\u201cI would you were a few years older, though.\u201d", "27": "\u201cOh, God gives years, but the devil gives increase,\u201d laughed he. \u201cI can hold my own.\u201d", "28": "\u201cHow is your prisoner?\u201d I asked.", "29": "\u201cThe K\u2014?\u201d", "30": "\u201cYour prisoner.\u201d", "31": "\u201cI forgot your wishes, sire. Well, he is alive.\u201d", "32": "He rose to his feet; I imitated him. Then, with a smile, he said:", "33": "\u201cAnd the pretty princess? Faith, I\u2019ll wager the next Elphberg will be red enough, for all that Black Michael will be called his father.\u201d", "34": "I sprang a step towards him, clenching my hand. He did not move an inch, and his lip curled in insolent amusement.", "35": "\u201cGo, while your skin\u2019s whole!\u201d I muttered. He had repaid me with interest my hit about his mother.", "36": "Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life. My friends were some thirty yards away. Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse, and dismissed the fellow with a crown. The horse stood near. I stood still, suspecting nothing. Rupert made as though to mount; then he suddenly turned to me: his left hand resting in his belt, his right outstretched: \u201cShake hands,\u201d he said.", "37": "I bowed, and did as he had foreseen\u2014I put my hands behind me. Quicker than thought, his left hand darted out at me, and a small dagger flashed in the air; he struck me in the left shoulder\u2014had I not swerved, it had been my heart. With a cry, I staggered back. Without touching the stirrup, he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow, pursued by cries and revolver shots\u2014the last as useless as the first\u2014and I sank into my chair, bleeding profusely, as I watched the devil\u2019s brat disappear down the long avenue. My friends surrounded me, and then I fainted.", "38": "I suppose that I was put to bed, and there lay, unconscious, or half conscious, for many hours; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind, and found Fritz beside me. I was weak and weary, but he bade me be of good cheer, saying that my wound would soon heal, and that meanwhile all had gone well, for Johann, the keeper, had fallen into the snare we had laid for him, and was even now in the house.", "39": "\u201cAnd the queer thing is,\u201d pursued Fritz, \u201cthat I fancy he\u2019s not altogether sorry to find himself here. He seems to think that when Black Michael has brought off his coup, witnesses of how it was effected\u2014saving, of course, the Six themselves\u2014will not be at a premium.\u201d", "40": "This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build hopes on his assistance. I ordered him to be brought in at once. Sapt conducted him, and set him in a chair by my bedside. He was sullen, and afraid; but, to say truth, after young Rupert\u2019s exploit, we also had our fears, and, if he got as far as possible from Sapt\u2019s formidable six-shooter, Sapt kept him as far as he could from me. Moreover, when he came in his hands were bound, but that I would not suffer.", "41": "I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow\u2014all of which were honourably observed and paid, so that he lives now in prosperity (though where I may not mention); and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked, and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done. But he had persuaded all of his loyalty; and though not in their secret counsels, was yet, by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle, able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices. And here, in brief, is his story:", "42": "Below the level of the ground in the Castle, approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge, were situated two small rooms, cut out of the rock itself. The outer of the two had no windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square window, which gave upon the moat. In the outer room there lay always, day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves. But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side. Thus, before the outer door were stormed, the King would be dead. And his body? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself.", "43": "\u201cNay, sir,\u201d said Johann, \u201chis Highness has thought of that. While the two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge). The window now gives no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe. The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for, lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe. He inserts the feet in the pipe, and pushes the body down. Silently, without splash or sound, it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat, which is twenty feet deep thereabouts. This done, the murderer cries loudly, \u2018All\u2019s well!\u2019 and himself slides down the pipe; and the others, if they can and the attack is not too hot, run to the inner room and, seeking a moment\u2019s delay, bar the door, and in their turn slide down. And though the King rises not from the bottom, they rise and swim round to the other side, where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes, to haul them out, and horses. And here, if things go ill, the duke will join them and seek safety by riding; but if all goes well, they will return to the Castle, and have their enemies in a trap. That, sir, is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need. But it is not to be used till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir. Now, sir, I have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the world\u2014a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him!\u201d", "44": "The fellow\u2019s story was rudely told, but our questions supplemented his narrative. What he had told us applied to an armed attack; but if suspicions were aroused, and there came overwhelming force\u2014such, for instance, as I, the King, could bring\u2014the idea of resistance would be abandoned; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe. And\u2014here comes an ingenious touch\u2014one of the Six would take his place in the cell, and, on the entrance of the searchers, loudly demand release and redress; and Michael, being summoned, would confess to hasty action, but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour of a lady in the Castle (this was Antoinette de Mauban) and he had confined him there, as he conceived he, as Lord of Zenda, had right to do. But he was now, on receiving his apology, content to let him go, and so end the gossip which, to his Highness\u2019s annoyance, had arisen concerning a prisoner in Zenda, and had given his visitors the trouble of this enquiry. The visitors, baffled, would retire, and Michael could, at his leisure, dispose of the body of the King.", "45": "Sapt, Fritz, and I in my bed, looked round on one another in horror and bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan. Whether I went in peace or in war, openly at the head of a corps, or secretly by a stealthy assault, the King would be dead before I could come near him. If Michael were stronger and overcame my party, there would be an end. But if I were stronger, I should have no way to punish him, no means of proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also. On the other hand, I should be left as King (ah! for a moment my pulse quickened) and it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and me. He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible. At the worst, he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path\u2014with but one man between him and the throne, and that man an impostor; at best, there would be none left to stand against him. I had begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting to his friends; but now I acknowledged that the brains, if not the arms, of the conspiracy were his.", "46": "\u201cDoes the King know this?\u201d I asked.", "47": "\u201cI and my brother,\u201d answered Johann, \u201cput up the pipe, under the orders of my Lord of Hentzau. He was on guard that day, and the King asked my lord what it meant. \u2018Faith,\u2019 he answered, with his airy laugh, \u2018it\u2019s a new improvement on the ladder of Jacob, whereby, as you have read, sire, men pass from the earth to heaven. We thought it not meet that your Majesty should go, in case, sire, you must go, by the common route. So we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar cannot stare at you or incommode your passage. That, sire, is the meaning of that pipe.\u2019 And he laughed and bowed, and prayed the King\u2019s leave to replenish the King\u2019s glass\u2014for the King was at supper. And the King, though he is a brave man, as are all of his House, grew red and then white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him. Ah, sir\u201d (and the fellow shuddered), \u201cit is not easy to sleep quiet in the Castle of Zenda, for all of them would as soon cut a man\u2019s throat as play a game at cards; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for a pastime than any other\u2014ay, sooner than he would ruin a woman, though that he loves also.\u201d", "48": "The man ceased, and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully guarded; and, turning to him, I added:", "49": "\u201cIf anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda, you may answer \u2018Yes.\u2019 But if any asks who the prisoner is, do not answer. For all my promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as to the prisoner of Zenda. I\u2019ll kill you like a dog if the thing be so much as breathed within the house!\u201d", "50": "Then, when he was gone, I looked at Sapt.", "51": "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard nut!\u201d said I.", "52": "\u201cSo hard,\u201d said he, shaking his grizzled head, \u201cthat as I think, this time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania!\u201d and he broke out into curses on Michael\u2019s cunning.", "53": "I lay back on my pillows.", "54": "\u201cThere seems to me,\u201d I observed, \u201cto be two ways by which the King can come out of Zenda alive. One is by treachery in the duke\u2019s followers.\u201d", "55": "\u201cYou can leave that out,\u201d said Sapt.", "56": "\u201cI hope not,\u201d I rejoined, \u201cbecause the other I was about to mention is\u2014by a miracle from heaven!\u201d"}, "CHAPTER 14": {"0": "It would have surprised the good people of Ruritania to know of the foregoing talk; for, according to the official reports, I had suffered a grievous and dangerous hurt from an accidental spear-thrust, received in the course of my sport. I caused the bulletins to be of a very serious character, and created great public excitement, whereby three things occurred: first, I gravely offended the medical faculty of Strelsau by refusing to summon to my bedside any of them, save a young man, a friend of Fritz\u2019s, whom we could trust; secondly, I received word from Marshal Strakencz that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his, and that the Princess Flavia was leaving for Tarlenheim under his unwilling escort (news whereat I strove not to be glad and proud); and thirdly, my brother, the Duke of Strelsau, although too well informed to believe the account of the origin of my sickness, was yet persuaded by the reports and by my seeming inactivity that I was in truth incapable of action, and that my life was in some danger. This I learnt from the man Johann, whom I was compelled to trust and send back to Zenda, where, by the way, Rupert Hentzau had him soundly flogged for daring to smirch the morals of Zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love. This, from Rupert, Johann deeply resented, and the duke\u2019s approval of it did more to bind the keeper to my side than all my promises.", "1": "On Flavia\u2019s arrival I cannot dwell. Her joy at finding me up and well, instead of on my back and fighting with death, makes a picture that even now dances before my eyes till they grow too dim to see it; and her reproaches that I had not trusted even her must excuse the means I took to quiet them. In truth, to have her with me once more was like a taste of heaven to a damned soul, the sweeter for the inevitable doom that was to follow; and I rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with her. And when I had wasted two days, the Duke of Strelsau arranged a hunting-party.", "2": "The stroke was near now. For Sapt and I, after anxious consultations, had resolved that we must risk a blow, our resolution being clinched by Johann\u2019s news that the King grew peaked, pale, and ill, and that his health was breaking down under his rigorous confinement. Now a man\u2014be he king or no king\u2014may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman, from bullet or thrust, as rot his life out in a cellar! That thought made prompt action advisable in the interests of the King; from my own point of view, it grew more and more necessary. For Strakencz urged on me the need of a speedy marriage, and my own inclinations seconded him with such terrible insistence that I feared for my resolution. I do not believe that I should have done the deed I dreamt of; but I might have come to flight, and my flight would have ruined the cause. And\u2014yes, I am no saint (ask my little sister-in-law), and worse still might have happened.", "3": "It is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of a country that the King\u2019s brother and the King\u2019s personator, in a time of profound outward peace, near a placid, undisturbed country town, under semblance of amity, should wage a desperate war for the person and life of the King. Yet such was the struggle that began now between Zenda and Tarlenheim. When I look back on the time, I seem to myself to have been half mad. Sapt has told me that I suffered no interference and listened to no remonstrances; and if ever a King of Ruritania ruled like a despot, I was, in those days, the man. Look where I would, I saw nothing that made life sweet to me, and I took my life in my hand and carried it carelessly as a man dangles an old glove. At first they strove to guard me, to keep me safe, to persuade me not to expose myself; but when they saw how I was set, there grew up among them\u2014whether they knew the truth or not\u2014a feeling that Fate ruled the issue, and that I must be left to play my game with Michael my own way.", "4": "Late next night I rose from table, where Flavia had sat by me, and conducted her to the door of her apartments. There I kissed her hand, and bade her sleep sound and wake to happy days. Then I changed my clothes and went out. Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me with six men and the horses. Over his saddle Sapt carried a long coil of rope, and both were heavily armed. I had with me a short stout cudgel and a long knife. Making a circuit, we avoided the town, and in an hour found ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the Castle of Zenda. The night was dark and very stormy; gusts of wind and spits of rain caught us as we breasted the incline, and the great trees moaned and sighed. When we came to a thick clump, about a quarter of a mile from the Castle, we bade our six friends hide there with the horses. Sapt had a whistle, and they could rejoin us in a few moments if danger came: but, up to now, we had met no one. I hoped that Michael was still off his guard, believing me to be safe in bed. However that might be, we gained the top of the hill without accident, and found ourselves on the edge of the moat where it sweeps under the road, separating the Old Castle from it. A tree stood on the edge of the bank, and Sapt, silently and diligently, set to make fast the rope. I stripped off my boots, took a pull at a flask of brandy, loosened the knife in its sheath, and took the cudgel between my teeth. Then I shook hands with my friends, not heeding a last look of entreaty from Fritz, and laid hold of the rope. I was going to have a look at \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d", "5": "Gently I lowered myself into the water. Though the night was wild, the day had been warm and bright, and the water was not cold. I struck out, and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me. I could see only three yards ahead; I had then good hopes of not being seen, as I crept along close under the damp, moss-grown masonry. There were lights from the new part of the Castle on the other side, and now and again I heard laughter and merry shouts. I fancied I recognized young Rupert Hentzau\u2019s ringing tones, and pictured him flushed with wine. Recalling my thoughts to the business in hand, I rested a moment. If Johann\u2019s description were right, I must be near the window now. Very slowly I moved; and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape. It was the pipe, curving from the window to the water: about four feet of its surface were displayed; it was as big round as two men. I was about to approach it, when I saw something else, and my heart stood still. The nose of a boat protruded beyond the pipe on the other side; and listening intently, I heard a slight shuffle\u2014as of a man shifting his position. Who was the man who guarded Michael\u2019s invention? Was he awake or was he asleep? I felt if my knife were ready, and trod water; as I did so, I found bottom under my feet. The foundations of the Castle extended some fifteen inches, making a ledge; and I stood on it, out of water from my armpits upwards. Then I crouched and peered through the darkness under the pipe, where, curving, it left a space.", "6": "There was a man in the boat. A rifle lay by him\u2014I saw the gleam of the barrel. Here was the sentinel! He sat very still. I listened; he breathed heavily, regularly, monotonously. By heaven, he slept! Kneeling on the shelf, I drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two feet of his. He was a big man, I saw. It was Max Holf, the brother of Johann. My hand stole to my belt, and I drew out my knife. Of all the deeds of my life, I love the least to think of this, and whether it were the act of a man or a traitor I will not ask. I said to myself: \u201cIt is war\u2014and the King\u2019s life is the stake.\u201d And I raised myself from beneath the pipe and stood up by the boat, which lay moored by the ledge. Holding my breath, I marked the spot and raised my arm. The great fellow stirred. He opened his eyes\u2014wide, wider. He gasped in terror at my face and clutched at his rifle. I struck home. And I heard the chorus of a love-song from the opposite bank.", "7": "Leaving him where he lay, a huddled mass, I turned to \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d My time was short. This fellow\u2019s turn of watching might be over directly, and relief would come. Leaning over the pipe, I examined it, from the end near the water to the topmost extremity where it passed, or seemed to pass, through the masonry of the wall. There was no break in it, no chink. Dropping on my knees, I tested the under side. And my breath went quick and fast, for on this lower side, where the pipe should have clung close to the masonry, there was a gleam of light! That light must come from the cell of the King! I set my shoulder against the pipe and exerted my strength. The chink widened a very, very little, and hastily I desisted; I had done enough to show that the pipe was not fixed in the masonry at the lower side.", "8": "Then I heard a voice\u2014a harsh, grating voice:", "9": "\u201cWell, sire, if you have had enough of my society, I will leave you to repose; but I must fasten the little ornaments first.\u201d", "10": "It was Detchard! I caught the English accent in a moment.", "11": "\u201cHave you anything to ask, sire, before we part?\u201d", "12": "The King\u2019s voice followed. It was his, though it was faint and hollow\u2014different from the merry tones I had heard in the glades of the forest.", "13": "\u201cPray my brother,\u201d said the King, \u201cto kill me. I am dying by inches here.\u201d", "14": "\u201cThe duke does not desire your death, sire\u2014yet,\u201d sneered Detchard; \u201cwhen he does behold your path to heaven!\u201d", "15": "The King answered:", "16": "\u201cSo be it! And now, if your orders allow it, pray leave me.\u201d", "17": "\u201cMay you dream of paradise!\u201d said the ruffian.", "18": "The light disappeared. I heard the bolts of the door run home. And then I heard the sobs of the King. He was alone, as he thought. Who dares mock at him?", "19": "I did not venture to speak to him. The risk of some exclamation escaping him in surprise was too great. I dared do nothing that night; and my task now was to get myself away in safety, and to carry off the carcass of the dead man. To leave him there would tell too much. Casting loose the boat, I got in. The wind was blowing a gale now, and there was little danger of oars being heard. I rowed swiftly round to where my friends waited. I had just reached the spot, when a loud whistle sounded over the moat behind me.", "20": "\u201cHullo, Max!\u201d I heard shouted.", "21": "I hailed Sapt in a low tone. The rope came down. I tied it round the corpse, and then went up it myself.", "22": "\u201cWhistle you too,\u201d I whispered, \u201cfor our men, and haul in the line. No talk now.\u201d", "23": "They hauled up the body. Just as it reached the road, three men on horseback swept round from the front of the Castle. We saw them; but, being on foot ourselves, we escaped their notice. But we heard our men coming up with a shout.", "24": "\u201cThe devil, but it\u2019s dark!\u201d cried a ringing voice.", "25": "It was young Rupert. A moment later, shots rang out. Our people had met them. I started forward at a run, Sapt and Fritz following me.", "26": "\u201cThrust, thrust!\u201d cried Rupert again, and a loud groan following told that he himself was not behind-hand.", "27": "\u201cI\u2019m done, Rupert!\u201d cried a voice. \u201cThey\u2019re three to one. Save yourself!\u201d", "28": "I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand. Suddenly a horse came towards me. A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.", "29": "\u201cAre you cooked too, Krafstein?\u201d he cried.", "30": "There was no answer.", "31": "I sprang to the horse\u2019s head. It was Rupert Hentzau.", "32": "\u201cAt last!\u201d I cried.", "33": "For we seemed to have him. He had only his sword in his hand. My men were hot upon him; Sapt and Fritz were running up. I had outstripped them; but if they got close enough to fire, he must die or surrender.", "34": "\u201cAt last!\u201d I cried.", "35": "\u201cIt\u2019s the play-actor!\u201d cried he, slashing at my cudgel. He cut it clean in two; and, judging discretion better than death, I ducked my head and (I blush to tell it) scampered for my life. The devil was in Rupert Hentzau; for he put spurs to his horse, and I, turning to look, saw him ride, full gallop, to the edge of the moat and leap in, while the shots of our party fell thick round him like hail. With one gleam of moonlight we should have riddled him with balls; but, in the darkness, he won to the corner of the Castle, and vanished from our sight.", "36": "\u201cThe deuce take him!\u201d grinned Sapt.", "37": "\u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d said I, \u201cthat he\u2019s a villain. Whom have we got?\u201d", "38": "We had Lauengram and Krafstein: they lay dead; and, concealment being no longer possible, we flung them, with Max, into the moat; and, drawing together in a compact body, rode off down the hill. And, in our midst, went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen. Thus we travelled home, heavy at heart for the death of our friends, sore uneasy concerning the King, and cut to the quick that young Rupert had played yet another winning hand with us.", "39": "For my own part, I was vexed and angry that I had killed no man in open fight, but only stabbed a knave in his sleep. And I did not love to hear Rupert call me a play-actor."}, "CHAPTER 15": {"0": "Ruritania is not England, or the quarrel between Duke Michael and myself could not have gone on, with the extraordinary incidents which marked it, without more public notice being directed to it. Duels were frequent among all the upper classes, and private quarrels between great men kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents. Nevertheless, after the affray which I have just related, such reports began to circulate that I felt it necessary to be on my guard. The death of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives. I issued a stern order, declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented licence (the Chancellor drew up the document for me, and very well he did it), and forbidding it save in the gravest cases. I sent a public and stately apology to Michael, and he returned a deferential and courteous reply to me; for our one point of union was\u2014and it underlay all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our actions\u2014that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the table.

I marked the effect on the garrison of Zenda: they ceased to be seen abroad; and any of my men who went near the Castle reported that the utmost vigilance prevailed there. Touched as I was by Madame de Mauban\u2019s appeal, I seemed as powerless to befriend her as I had proved to help the King. Michael bade me defiance; and although he too had been seen outside the walls, with more disregard for appearances than he had hitherto shown, he did not take the trouble to send any excuse for his failure to wait on the King. Time ran on in inactivity, when every moment was pressing; for not only was I faced with the new danger which the stir about my disappearance brought on me, but great murmurs had arisen in Strelsau at my continued absence from the city. They had been greater, but for the knowledge that Flavia was with me; and for this reason I suffered her to stay, though I hated to have her where danger was, and though every day of our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost to breaking. As a final blow, nothing would content my advisers, Strakencz and the Chancellor (who came out from Strelsau to make an urgent representation to me), save that I should appoint a day for the public solemnization of my betrothal, a ceremony which in Ruritania is well nigh as binding and great a thing as the marriage itself. And this\u2014with Flavia sitting by me\u2014I was forced to do, setting a date a fortnight ahead, and appointing the Cathedral in Strelsau as the place. And this formal act being published far and wide, caused great joy throughout the kingdom, and was the talk of all tongues; so that I reckoned there were but two men who chafed at it\u2014I mean Black Michael and myself; and but one who did not know of it\u2014that one the man whose name I bore, the King of Ruritania.", "1": "In truth, I heard something of the way the news was received in the Castle; for after an interval of three days, the man Johann, greedy for more money, though fearful for his life, again found means to visit us. He had been waiting on the duke when the tidings came. Black Michael\u2019s face had grown blacker still, and he had sworn savagely; nor was he better pleased when young Rupert took oath that I meant to do as I said, and turning to Madame de Mauban, wished her joy on a rival gone. Michael\u2019s hand stole towards his sword (said Johann), but not a bit did Rupert care; for he rallied the duke on having made a better King than had reigned for years past in Ruritania. \u201cAnd,\u201d said he, with a meaning bow to his exasperated master, \u201cthe devil sends the princess a finer man than heaven had marked out for her, by my soul, it does!\u201d Then Michael harshly bade him hold his tongue, and leave them; but Rupert must needs first kiss madame\u2019s hand, which he did as though he loved her, while Michael glared at him.", "2": "This was the lighter side of the fellow\u2019s news; but more serious came behind, and it was plain that if time pressed at Tarlenheim, it pressed none the less fiercely at Zenda. For the King was very sick: Johann had seen him, and he was wasted and hardly able to move. \u201cThere could be no thought of taking another for him now.\u201d So alarmed were they, that they had sent for a physician from Strelsau; and the physician having been introduced into the King\u2019s cell, had come forth pale and trembling, and urgently prayed the duke to let him go back and meddle no more in the affair; but the duke would not, and held him there a prisoner, telling him his life was safe if the King lived while the duke desired and died when the duke desired\u2014not otherwise. And, persuaded by the physician, they had allowed Madame de Mauban to visit the King and give him such attendance as his state needed, and as only a woman can give. Yet his life hung in the balance; and I was still strong and whole and free. Wherefore great gloom reigned at Zenda; and save when they quarrelled, to which they were very prone, they hardly spoke. But the deeper the depression of the rest, young Rupert went about Satan\u2019s work with a smile in his eye and a song on his lip; and laughed \u201cfit to burst\u201d (said Johann) because the duke always set Detchard to guard the King when Madame de Mauban was in the cell\u2014which precaution was, indeed, not unwise in my careful brother. Thus Johann told his tale and seized his crowns. Yet he besought us to allow him to stay with us in Tarlenheim, and not venture his head again in the lion\u2019s den; but we had need of him there, and, although I refused to constrain him, I prevailed on him by increased rewards to go back and carry tidings to Madame de Mauban that I was working for her, and that, if she could, she should speak one word of comfort to the King. For while suspense is bad for the sick, yet despair is worse still, and it might be that the King lay dying of mere hopelessness, for I could learn of no definite disease that afflicted him.", "3": "\u201cAnd how do they guard the King now?\u201d I asked, remembering that two of the Six were dead, and Max Holf also.", "4": "\u201cDetchard and Bersonin watch by night, Rupert Hentzau and De Gautet by day, sir,\u201d he answered.", "5": "\u201cOnly two at a time?\u201d", "6": "\u201cAy, sir; but the others rest in a room just above, and are within sound of a cry or a whistle.\u201d", "7": "\u201cA room just above?

Still the cries would go on; and my men would let down the drawbridge; and it would be strange if Rupert, hearing his name thus taken in vain, did not descend from where he slept and seek to cross. De Gautet might or might not come with him: that must be left to chance.", "61": "And when Rupert set his foot on the drawbridge? There was my part: for I was minded for another swim in the moat; and, lest I should grow weary, I had resolved to take with me a small wooden ladder, on which I could rest my arms in the water\u2014and my feet when I left it. I would rear it against the wall just by the bridge; and when the bridge was across, I would stealthily creep on to it\u2014and then if Rupert or De Gautet crossed in safety, it would be my misfortune, not my fault. They dead, two men only would remain; and for them we must trust to the confusion we had created and to a sudden rush. We should have the keys of the door that led to the all-important rooms. Perhaps they would rush out. If they stood by their orders, then the King\u2019s life hung on the swiftness with which we could force the outer door; and I thanked God that not Rupert Hentzau watched, but Detchard. For though Detchard was a cool man, relentless, and no coward, he had neither the dash nor the recklessness of Rupert. Moreover, he, if any one of them, really loved Black Michael, and it might be that he would leave Bersonin to guard the King, and rush across the bridge to take part in the affray on the other side.", "62": "So I planned\u2014desperately. And, that our enemy might be the better lulled to security, I gave orders that our residence should be brilliantly lighted from top to bottom, as though we were engaged in revelry; and should so be kept all night, with music playing and people moving to and fro. Strakencz would be there, and he was to conceal our departure, if he could, from Flavia. And if we came not again by the morning, he was to march, openly and in force to the Castle, and demand the person of the King; if Black Michael were not there, as I did not think he would be, the Marshal would take Flavia with him, as swiftly as he could, to Strelsau, and there proclaim Black Michael\u2019s treachery and the probable death of the King, and rally all that there was honest and true round the banner of the princess. And, to say truth, this was what I thought most likely to happen. For I had great doubts whether either the King or Black Michael or I had more than a day to live. Well, if Black Michael died, and if I, the play-actor, slew Rupert Hentzau with my own hand, and then died myself, it might be that Fate would deal as lightly with Ruritania as could be hoped, notwithstanding that she demanded the life of the King\u2014and to her dealing thus with me, I was in no temper to make objection.", "63": "It was late when we rose from conference, and I betook me to the princess\u2019s apartments. She was pensive that evening; yet, when I left her, she flung her arms about me and grew, for an instant, bashfully radiant as she slipped a ring on my finger. I was wearing the King\u2019s ring; but I had also on my little finger a plain band of gold engraved with the motto of our family: \u201cNil Quae Feci.\u201d This I took off and put on her, and signed to her to let me go. And she, understanding, stood away and watched me with dimmed eyes.", "64": "\u201cWear that ring, even though you wear another when you are queen,\u201d I said.", "65": "\u201cWhatever else I wear, this I will wear till I die and after,\u201d said she, as she kissed the ring."}, "CHAPTER 17": {"0": "The night came fine and clear. I had prayed for dirty weather, such as had favoured my previous voyage in the moat, but Fortune was this time against me. Still I reckoned that by keeping close under the wall and in the shadow I could escape detection from the windows of the chateau that looked out on the scene of my efforts. If they searched the moat, indeed, my scheme must fail; but I did not think they would. They had made \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d secure against attack. Johann had himself helped to fix it closely to the masonry on the under side, so that it could not now be moved from below any more than from above. An assault with explosives or a long battering with picks alone could displace it, and the noise involved in either of these operations put them out of the question. What harm, then, could a man do in the moat? I trusted that Black Michael, putting this query to himself, would answer confidently, \u201cNone;\u201d while, even if Johann meant treachery, he did not know my scheme, and would doubtless expect to see me, at the head of my friends, before the front entrance to the chateau. There, I said to Sapt, was the real danger. \u201cAnd there,\u201d I added, \u201cyou shall be. Doesn\u2019t that content you?\u201d", "1": "But it did not. Dearly would he have liked to come with me, had I not utterly refused to take him. One man might escape notice, to double the party more than doubled the risk; and when he ventured to hint once again that my life was too valuable, I, knowing the secret thought he clung to, sternly bade him be silent, assuring him that unless the King lived through the night, I would not live through it either.", "2": "At twelve o\u2019clock, Sapt\u2019s command left the chateau of Tarlenheim and struck off to the right, riding by unfrequented roads, and avoiding the town of Zenda. If all went well, they would be in front of the Castle by about a quarter to two. Leaving their horses half a mile off, they were to steal up to the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the opening of the door. If the door were not opened by two, they were to send Fritz von Tarlenheim round to the other side of the Castle. I would meet him there if I were alive, and we would consult whether to storm the Castle or not. If I were not there, they were to return with all speed to Tarlenheim, rouse the Marshal, and march in force to Zenda. For if not there, I should be dead; and I knew that the King would not be alive five minutes after I ceased to breathe. I must now leave Sapt and his friends, and relate how I myself proceeded on this eventful night. I went out on the good horse which had carried me, on the night of the coronation, back from the hunting-lodge to Strelsau. I carried a revolver in the saddle and my sword. I was covered with a large cloak, and under this I wore a warm, tight-fitting woollen jersey, a pair of knickerbockers, thick stockings, and light canvas shoes. I had rubbed myself thoroughly with oil, and I carried a large flask of whisky. The night was warm, but I might probably be immersed a long while, and it was necessary to take every precaution against cold: for cold not only saps a man\u2019s courage if he has to die, but impairs his energy if others have to die, and, finally, gives him rheumatics, if it be God\u2019s will that he lives. Also I tied round my body a length of thin but stout cord, and I did not forget my ladder. I, starting after Sapt, took a shorter route, skirting the town to the left, and found myself in the outskirts of the forest at about half-past twelve. I tied my horse up in a thick clump of trees, leaving the revolver in its pocket in the saddle\u2014it would be no use to me\u2014and, ladder in hand, made my way to the edge of the moat. Here I unwound my rope from about my waist, bound it securely round the trunk of a tree on the bank, and let myself down. The Castle clock struck a quarter to one as I felt the water under me and began to swim round the keep, pushing the ladder before me, and hugging the Castle wall. Thus voyaging, I came to my old friend, \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder,\u201d and felt the ledge of the masonry under me. I crouched down in the shadow of the great pipe\u2014I tried to stir it, but it was quite immovable\u2014and waited. I remember that my predominant feeling was neither anxiety for the King nor longing for Flavia, but an intense desire to smoke; and this craving, of course, I could not gratify.", "3": "The drawbridge was still in its place. I saw its airy, slight framework above me, some ten yards to my right, as I crouched with my back against the wall of the King\u2019s cell. I made out a window two yards my side of it and nearly on the same level. That, if Johann spoke true, must belong to the duke\u2019s apartments; and on the other side, in about the same relative position, must be Madame de Mauban\u2019s window. Women are careless, forgetful creatures. I prayed that she might not forget that she was to be the victim of a brutal attempt at two o\u2019clock precisely. I was rather amused at the part I had assigned to my young friend Rupert Hentzau; but I owed him a stroke\u2014for, even as I sat, my shoulder ached where he had, with an audacity that seemed half to hide his treachery, struck at me, in the sight of all my friends, on the terrace at Tarlenheim.", "4": "Suddenly the duke\u2019s window grew bright. The shutters were not closed, and the interior became partially visible to me as I cautiously raised myself till I stood on tiptoe. Thus placed, my range of sight embraced a yard or more inside the window, while the radius of light did not reach me. The window was flung open and someone looked out. I marked Antoinette de Mauban\u2019s graceful figure, and, though her face was in shadow, the fine outline of her head was revealed against the light behind. I longed to cry softly, \u201cRemember!\u201d but I dared not\u2014and happily, for a moment later a man came up and stood by her. He tried to put his arm round her waist, but with a swift motion she sprang away and leant against the shutter, her profile towards me. I made out who the newcomer was: it was young Rupert. A low laugh from him made me sure, as he leant forward, stretching out his hand towards her.", "5": "\u201cGently, gently!\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re too soon, my boy!\u201d", "6": "His head was close to hers. I suppose he whispered to her, for I saw her point to the moat, and I heard her say, in slow and distinct tones:", "7": "\u201cI had rather throw myself out of this window!\u201d", "8": "He came close up to the window and looked out.", "9": "\u201cIt looks cold,\u201d said he. \u201cCome, Antoinette, are you serious?\u201d", "10": "She made no answer so far as I heard; and he, smiting his hand petulantly on the window-sill, went on, in the voice of some spoilt child:", "11": "\u201cHang Black Michael! Isn\u2019t the princess enough for him? Is he to have everything? What the devil do you see in Black Michael?\u201d", "12": "\u201cIf I told him what you say\u2014\u201d she began.", "13": "\u201cWell, tell him,\u201d said Rupert, carelessly; and, catching her off her guard, he sprang forward and kissed her, laughing, and crying, \u201cThere\u2019s something to tell him!\u201d", "14": "If I had kept my revolver with me, I should have been very sorely tempted. Being spared the temptation, I merely added this new score to his account.", "15": "\u201cThough, faith,\u201d said Rupert, \u201cit\u2019s little he cares. He\u2019s mad about the princess, you know. He talks of nothing but cutting the play-actor\u2019s throat.\u201d", "16": "Didn\u2019t he, indeed?", "17": "\u201cAnd if I do it for him, what do you think he\u2019s promised me?\u201d", "18": "The unhappy woman raised her hands above her head, in prayer or in despair.", "19": "\u201cBut I detest waiting,\u201d said Rupert; and I saw that he was about to lay his hand on her again, when there was a noise of a door in the room opening, and a harsh voice cried:", "20": "\u201cWhat are you doing here, sir?\u201d", "21": "Rupert turned his back to the window, bowed low, and said, in his loud, merry tones: \u201cApologizing for your absence, sir. Could I leave the lady alone?\u201d", "22": "The newcomer must be Black Michael. I saw him directly, as he advanced towards the window. He caught young Rupert by the arm.", "23": "\u201cThe moat would hold more than the King!\u201d said he, with a significant gesture.", "24": "\u201cDoes your Highness threaten me?\u201d asked Rupert.", "25": "\u201cA threat is more warning than most men get from me.\u201d", "26": "\u201cYet,\u201d observed Rupert, \u201cRudolf Rassendyll has been much threatened, and yet lives!\u201d", "27": "\u201cAm I in fault because my servants bungle?\u201d asked Michael scornfully.", "28": "\u201cYour Highness has run no risk of bungling!\u201d sneered Rupert.", "29": "It was telling the duke that he shirked danger as plain as ever I have heard a man told. Black Michael had self-control. I dare say he scowled\u2014it was a great regret to me that I could not see their faces better\u2014but his voice was even and calm, as he answered:", "30": "\u201cEnough, enough! We mustn\u2019t quarrel, Rupert. Are Detchard and Bersonin at their posts?\u201d", "31": "\u201cThey are, sir.\u201d", "32": "\u201cI need you no more.\u201d", "33": "\u201cNay, I\u2019m not oppressed with fatigue,\u201d said Rupert.", "34": "\u201cPray, sir, leave us,\u201d said Michael, more impatiently. \u201cIn ten minutes the drawbridge will be drawn back, and I presume you have no wish to swim to your bed.\u201d", "35": "Rupert\u2019s figure disappeared. I heard the door open and shut again. Michael and Antoinette de Mauban were left together. To my chagrin, the duke laid his hand on the window and closed it. He stood talking to Antoinette for a moment or two. She shook her head, and he turned impatiently away. She left the window. The door sounded again, and Black Michael closed the shutters.", "36": "\u201cDe Gautet, De Gautet, man!\u201d sounded from the drawbridge. \u201cUnless you want a bath before your bed, come along!\u201d", "37": "It was Rupert\u2019s voice, coming from the end of the drawbridge. A moment later he and De Gautet stepped out on the bridge. Rupert\u2019s arm was through De Gautet\u2019s, and in the middle of the bridge he detained his companion and leant over. I dropped behind the shelter of \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d", "38": "Then Master Rupert had a little sport. He took from De Gautet a bottle which he carried, and put it to his lips.", "39": "\u201cHardly a drop!\u201d he cried discontentedly, and flung it in the moat.", "40": "It fell, as I judged from the sound and the circles on the water, within a yard of the pipe. And Rupert, taking out his revolver, began to shoot at it. The first two shots missed the bottle, but hit the pipe. The third shattered the bottle. I hoped that the young ruffian would be content; but he emptied the other barrels at the pipe, and one, skimming over the pipe, whistled through my hair as I crouched on the other side.", "41": "\u201c\u2018Ware bridge!\u201d a voice cried, to my relief.", "42": "Rupert and De Gautet cried, \u201cA moment!\u201d and ran across. The bridge was drawn back, and all became still. The clock struck a quarter-past one. I rose and stretched myself and yawned.", "43": "I think some ten minutes had passed when I heard a slight noise to my right. I peered over the pipe, and saw a dark figure standing in the gateway that led to the bridge. It was a man. By the careless, graceful poise, I guessed it to be Rupert again. He held a sword in his hand, and he stood motionless for a minute or two. Wild thoughts ran through me. On what mischief was the young fiend bent now? Then he laughed low to himself; then he turned his face to the wall, took a step in my direction, and, to my surprise, began to climb down the wall. In an instant I saw that there must be steps in the wall; it was plain. They were cut into or affixed to the wall, at intervals of about eighteen inches. Rupert set his foot on the lower one. Then he placed his sword between his teeth, turned round, and noiselessly let himself into the water. Had it been a matter of my life only, I would have swum to meet him. Dearly would I have loved to fight it out with him then and there\u2014with steel, on a fine night, and none to come between us. But there was the King! I restrained myself, but I could not bridle my swift breathing, and I watched him with the intensest eagerness.", "44": "He swam leisurely and quietly across. There were more steps up on the other side, and he climbed them. When he set foot in the gateway, standing on the drawn-back bridge, he felt in his pocket and took something out. I heard him unlock the door. I could hear no noise of its closing behind him. He vanished from my sight.", "45": "Abandoning my ladder\u2014I saw I did not need it now\u2014I swam to the side of the bridge and climbed half way up the steps. There I hung with my sword in my hand, listening eagerly. The duke\u2019s room was shuttered and dark. There was a light in the window on the opposite side of the bridge. Not a sound broke the silence, till half-past one chimed from the great clock in the tower of the chateau.", "46": "There were other plots than mine afoot in the Castle that night."}, "CHAPTER 18": {"0": "The position wherein I stood does not appear very favourable to thought; yet for the next moment or two I thought profoundly. I had, I told myself, scored one point. Be Rupert Hentzau\u2019s errand what it might, and the villainy he was engaged on what it would, I had scored one point. He was on the other side of the moat from the King, and it would be by no fault of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again. I had three left to deal with: two on guard and De Gautet in his bed. Ah, if I had the keys! I would have risked everything and attacked Detchard and Bersonin before their friends could join them. But I was powerless. I must wait till the coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the bridge\u2014someone with the keys. And I waited, as it seemed, for half an hour, really for about five minutes, before the next act in the rapid drama began.", "1": "All was still on the other side. The duke\u2019s room remained inscrutable behind its shutters. The light burnt steadily in Madame de Mauban\u2019s window. Then I heard the faintest, faintest sound: it came from behind the door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat. It but just reached my ear, yet I could not be mistaken as to what it was. It was made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly. Who was turning it? And of what room was it the key? There leapt before my eyes the picture of young Rupert, with the key in one hand, his sword in the other, and an evil smile on his face. But I did not know what door it was, nor on which of his favourite pursuits young Rupert was spending the hours of that night.", "2": "I was soon to be enlightened, for the next moment\u2014before my friends could be near the chateau door\u2014before Johann the keeper would have thought to nerve himself for his task\u2014there was a sudden crash from the room with the lighted window. It sounded as though someone had flung down a lamp; and the window went dark and black. At the same instant a cry rang out, shrill in the night: \u201cHelp, help! Michael, help!\u201d and was followed by a shriek of utter terror.", "3": "I was tingling in every nerve. I stood on the topmost step, clinging to the threshold of the gate with my right hand and holding my sword in my left. Suddenly I perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge; there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand. I darted across and stood there. Thus placed, I commanded the path, and no man could pass between the chateau and the old Castle till he had tried conclusions with me.", "4": "There was another shriek. Then a door was flung open and clanged against the wall, and I heard the handle of a door savagely twisted.", "5": "\u201cOpen the door! In God\u2019s name, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d cried a voice\u2014the voice of Black Michael himself.", "6": "He was answered by the very words I had written in my letter.", "7": "\u201cHelp, Michael\u2014Hentzau!\u201d", "8": "A fierce oath rang out from the duke, and with a loud thud he threw himself against the door. At the same moment I heard a window above my head open, and a voice cried: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d and I heard a man\u2019s hasty footsteps. I grasped my sword. If De Gautet came my way, the Six would be less by one more.", "9": "Then I heard the clash of crossed swords and a tramp of feet and\u2014I cannot tell the thing so quickly as it happened, for all seemed to come at once. There was an angry cry from madame\u2019s room, the cry of a wounded man; the window was flung open; young Rupert stood there sword in hand. He turned his back, and I saw his body go forward to the lunge.", "10": "\u201cAh, Johann, there\u2019s one for you! Come on, Michael!\u201d", "11": "Johann was there, then\u2014come to the rescue of the duke! How would he open the door for me? For I feared that Rupert had slain him.", "12": "\u201cHelp!\u201d cried the duke\u2019s voice, faint and husky.", "13": "I heard a step on the stairs above me; and I heard a stir down to my left, in the direction of the King\u2019s cell. But, before anything happened on my side of the moat, I saw five or six men round young Rupert in the embrasure of madame\u2019s window. Three or four times he lunged with incomparable dash and dexterity. For an instant they fell back, leaving a ring round him. He leapt on the parapet of the window, laughing as he leapt, and waving his sword in his hand. He was drunk with blood, and he laughed again wildly as he flung himself headlong into the moat.", "14": "What became of him then? I did not see: for as he leapt, De Gautet\u2019s lean face looked out through the door by me, and, without a second\u2019s hesitation, I struck at him with all the strength God had given me, and he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan. I dropped on my knees by him. Where were the keys? I found myself muttering: \u201cThe keys, man, the keys?\u201d as though he had been yet alive and could listen; and when I could not find them, I\u2014God forgive me!\u2014I believe I struck a dead man\u2019s face.", "15": "At last I had them. There were but three. Seizing the largest, I felt the lock of the door that led to the cell. I fitted in the key. It was right. The lock turned. I drew the door close behind me and locked it as noiselessly as I could, putting the key in my pocket.", "16": "I found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs. An oil lamp burnt dimly in the bracket. I took it down and held it in my hand; and I stood and listened.", "17": "\u201cWhat in the devil can it be?\u201d I heard a voice say.", "18": "It came from behind a door that faced me at the bottom of the stairs.", "19": "And another answered:", "20": "\u201cShall we kill him?\u201d", "21": "I strained to hear the answer, and could have sobbed with relief when Detchard\u2019s voice came grating and cold:", "22": "\u201cWait a bit. There\u2019ll be trouble if we strike too soon.\u201d", "23": "There was a moment\u2019s silence. Then I heard the bolt of the door cautiously drawn back. Instantly I put out the light I held, replacing the lamp in the bracket.", "24": "\u201cIt\u2019s dark\u2014the lamp\u2019s out. Have you a light?\u201d said the other voice\u2014Bersonin\u2019s.", "25": "No doubt they had a light, but they should not use it. It was come to the crisis now, and I rushed down the steps and flung myself against the door. Bersonin had unbolted it and it gave way before me. The Belgian stood there sword in hand, and Detchard was sitting on a couch at the side of the room. In astonishment at seeing me, Bersonin recoiled; Detchard jumped to his sword. I rushed madly at the Belgian: he gave way before me, and I drove him up against the wall. He was no swordsman, though he fought bravely, and in a moment he lay on the floor before me. I turned\u2014Detchard was not there. Faithful to his orders, he had not risked a fight with me, but had rushed straight to the door of the King\u2019s room, opened it and slammed it behind him. Even now he was at his work inside.", "26": "And surely he would have killed the King, and perhaps me also, had it not been for one devoted man who gave his life for the King. For when I forced the door, the sight I saw was this: the King stood in the corner of the room: broken by his sickness, he could do nothing; his fettered hands moved uselessly up and down, and he was laughing horribly in half-mad delirium. Detchard and the doctor were together in the middle of the room; and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer, pinning his hands to his sides for an instant. Then Detchard wrenched himself free from the feeble grip, and, as I entered, drove his sword through the hapless man. Then he turned on me, crying:", "27": "\u201cAt last!\u201d", "28": "We were sword to sword. By blessed chance, neither he nor Bersonin had been wearing their revolvers. I found them afterwards, ready loaded, on the mantelpiece of the outer room: it was hard by the door, ready to their hands, but my sudden rush in had cut off access to them. Yes, we were man to man: and we began to fight, silently, sternly, and hard. Yet I remember little of it, save that the man was my match with the sword\u2014nay, and more, for he knew more tricks than I; and that he forced me back against the bars that guarded the entrance to \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d And I saw a smile on his face, and he wounded me in the left arm.", "29": "No glory do I take for that contest. I believe that the man would have mastered me and slain me, and then done his butcher\u2019s work, for he was the most skilful swordsman I have ever met; but even as he pressed me hard, the half-mad, wasted, wan creature in the corner leapt high in lunatic mirth, shrieking:", "30": "\u201cIt\u2019s cousin Rudolf! Cousin Rudolf! I\u2019ll help you, cousin Rudolf!\u201d and catching up a chair in his hands (he could but just lift it from the ground and hold it uselessly before him) he came towards us. Hope came to me. \u201cCome on!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome on! Drive it against his legs.\u201d", "31": "Detchard replied with a savage thrust. He all but had me.", "32": "\u201cCome on! Come on, man!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome and share the fun!\u201d", "33": "And the King laughed gleefully, and came on, pushing his chair before him.", "34": "With an oath Detchard skipped back, and, before I knew what he was doing, had turned his sword against the King. He made one fierce cut at the King, and the King, with a piteous cry, dropped where he stood. The stout ruffian turned to face me again. But his own hand had prepared his destruction: for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed from the dead physician. He slipped; he fell. Like a dart I was upon him. I caught him by the throat, and before he could recover himself I drove my point through his neck, and with a stifled curse he fell across the body of his victim.", "35": "Was the King dead? It was my first thought. I rushed to where he lay. Ay, it seemed as if he were dead, for he had a great gash across his forehead, and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor. I dropped on my knees beside him, and leant my ear down to hear if he breathed. But before I could there was a loud rattle from the outside. I knew the sound: the drawbridge was being pushed out. A moment later it rang home against the wall on my side of the moat. I should be caught in a trap and the King with me, if he yet lived. He must take his chance, to live or die. I took my sword, and passed into the outer room. Who were pushing the drawbridge out\u2014my men? If so, all was well. My eye fell on the revolvers, and I seized one; and paused to listen in the doorway of the outer room. To listen, say I? Yes, and to get my breath: and I tore my shirt and twisted a strip of it round my bleeding arm; and stood listening again. I would have given the world to hear Sapt\u2019s voice. For I was faint, spent, and weary. And that wild-cat Rupert Hentzau was yet at large in the Castle. Yet, because I could better defend the narrow door at the top of the stairs than the wider entrance to the room, I dragged myself up the steps, and stood behind it listening.", "36": "What was the sound? Again a strange one for the place and time. An easy, scornful, merry laugh\u2014the laugh of young Rupert Hentzau! I could scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh. Yet the laugh told me that my men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had come. And the clock struck half-past two! My God! The door had not been opened! They had gone to the bank! They had not found me! They had gone by now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the King\u2019s death\u2014and mine. Well, it would be true before they got there. Was not Rupert laughing in triumph?", "37": "For a moment, I sank, unnerved, against the door. Then I started up alert again, for Rupert cried scornfully:", "38": "\u201cWell, the bridge is there! Come over it! And in God\u2019s name, let\u2019s see Black Michael. Keep back, you curs! Michael, come and fight for her!\u201d", "39": "If it were a three-cornered fight, I might yet bear my part. I turned the key in the door and looked out."}, "CHAPTER 19": {"0": "For a moment I could see nothing, for the glare of lanterns and torches caught me full in the eyes from the other side of the bridge. But soon the scene grew clear: and it was a strange scene. The bridge was in its place. At the far end of it stood a group of the duke\u2019s servants; two or three carried the lights which had dazzled me, three or four held pikes in rest. They were huddled together; their weapons were protruded before them; their faces were pale and agitated. To put it plainly, they looked in as arrant a fright as I have seen men look, and they gazed apprehensively at a man who stood in the middle of the bridge, sword in hand. Rupert Hentzau was in his trousers and shirt; the white linen was stained with blood, but his easy, buoyant pose told me that he was himself either not touched at all or merely scratched. There he stood, holding the bridge against them, and daring them to come on; or, rather, bidding them send Black Michael to him; and they, having no firearms, cowered before the desperate man and dared not attack him. They whispered to one another; and in the backmost rank, I saw my friend Johann, leaning against the portal of the door and stanching with a handkerchief the blood which flowed from a wound in his cheek.", "1": "By marvellous chance, I was master. The cravens would oppose me no more than they dared attack Rupert. I had but to raise my revolver, and I sent him to his account with his sins on his head. He did not so much as know that I was there. I did nothing\u2014why, I hardly know to this day. I had killed one man stealthily that night, and another by luck rather than skill\u2014perhaps it was that. Again, villain as the man was, I did not relish being one of a crowd against him\u2014perhaps it was that. But stronger than either of these restrained feelings came a curiosity and a fascination which held me spellbound, watching for the outcome of the scene.", "2": "\u201cMichael, you dog! Michael! If you can stand, come on!\u201d cried Rupert; and he advanced a step, the group shrinking back a little before him. \u201cMichael, you bastard! Come on!\u201d", "3": "The answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman:", "4": "\u201cHe\u2019s dead! My God, he\u2019s dead!\u201d", "5": "\u201cDead!\u201d shouted Rupert. \u201cI struck better than I knew!\u201d and he laughed triumphantly. Then he went on: \u201cDown with your weapons there! I\u2019m your master now! Down with them, I say!\u201d", "6": "I believe they would have obeyed, but as he spoke came new things. First, there arose a distant sound, as of shouts and knockings from the other side of the chateau. My heart leapt. It must be my men, come by a happy disobedience to seek me. The noise continued, but none of the rest seemed to heed it. Their attention was chained by what now happened before their eyes. The group of servants parted and a woman staggered on to the bridge. Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her dark hair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches. In her shaking hand she held a revolver, and, as she tottered forward, she fired it at Rupert Hentzau. The ball missed him, and struck the woodwork over my head.", "7": "\u201cFaith, madame,\u201d laughed Rupert, \u201chad your eyes been no more deadly than your shooting, I had not been in this scrape\u2014nor Black Michael in hell\u2014tonight!\u201d", "8": "She took no notice of his words. With a wonderful effort, she calmed herself till she stood still and rigid. Then very slowly and deliberately she began to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim.", "9": "He would be mad to risk it. He must rush on her, chancing the bullet, or retreat towards me. I covered him with my weapon.", "10": "He did neither. Before she had got her aim, he bowed in his most graceful fashion, cried \u201cI can\u2019t kill where I\u2019ve kissed,\u201d and before she or I could stop him, laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge, and lightly leapt into the moat.", "11": "At that very moment I heard a rush of feet, and a voice I knew\u2014Sapt\u2019s\u2014cry: \u201cGod! it\u2019s the duke\u2014dead!\u201d Then I knew that the King needed me no more, and throwing down my revolver, I sprang out on the bridge. There was a cry of wild wonder, \u201cThe King!\u201d and then I, like Rupert of Hentzau, sword in hand, vaulted over the parapet, intent on finishing my quarrel with him where I saw his curly head fifteen yards off in the water of the moat.", "12": "He swam swiftly and easily. I was weary and half crippled with my wounded arm. I could not gain on him. For a time I made no sound, but as we rounded the corner of the old keep I cried:", "13": "\u201cStop, Rupert, stop!\u201d", "14": "I saw him look over his shoulder, but he swam on. He was under the bank now, searching, as I guessed, for a spot that he could climb. I knew there to be none\u2014but there was my rope, which would still be hanging where I had left it. He would come to where it was before I could. Perhaps he would miss it\u2014perhaps he would find it; and if he drew it up after him, he would get a good start of me. I put forth all my remaining strength and pressed on. At last I began to gain on him; for he, occupied with his search, unconsciously slackened his pace.", "15": "Ah, he had found it! A low shout of triumph came from him. He laid hold of it and began to haul himself up. I was near enough to hear him mutter: \u201cHow the devil comes this here?\u201d I was at the rope, and he, hanging in mid air, saw me, but I could not reach him.", "16": "\u201cHullo! who\u2019s here?\u201d he cried in startled tones.", "17": "For a moment, I believe, he took me for the King\u2014I dare say I was pale enough to lend colour to the thought; but an instant later he cried:", "18": "\u201cWhy it\u2019s the play-actor! How come you here, man?\u201d", "19": "And so saying he gained the bank.", "20": "I laid hold of the rope, but I paused. He stood on the bank, sword in hand, and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as I came up. I let go the rope.", "21": "\u201cNever mind,\u201d said I; \u201cbut as I am here, I think I\u2019ll stay.\u201d", "22": "He smiled down on me.", "23": "\u201cThese women are the deuce\u2014\u201d he began; when suddenly the great bell of the Castle started to ring furiously, and a loud shout reached us from the moat.", "24": "Rupert smiled again, and waved his hand to me.", "25": "\u201cI should like a turn with you, but it\u2019s a little too hot!\u201d said he, and he disappeared from above me.", "26": "In an instant, without thinking of danger, I laid my hand to the rope. I was up. I saw him thirty yards off, running like a deer towards the shelter of the forest. For once Rupert Hentzau had chosen discretion for his part. I laid my feet to the ground and rushed after him, calling to him to stand. He would not. Unwounded and vigorous, he gained on me at every step; but, forgetting everything in the world except him and my thirst for his blood, I pressed on, and soon the deep shades of the forest of Zenda engulfed us both, pursued and pursuer.", "27": "It was three o\u2019clock now, and day was dawning. I was on a long straight grass avenue, and a hundred yards ahead ran young Rupert, his curls waving in the fresh breeze. I was weary and panting; he looked over his shoulder and waved his hand again to me. He was mocking me, for he saw he had the pace of me. I was forced to pause for breath. A moment later, Rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight.", "28": "I thought all was over, and in deep vexation sank on the ground. But I was up again directly, for a scream rang through the forest\u2014a woman\u2019s scream. Putting forth the last of my strength, I ran on to the place where he had turned out of my sight, and, turning also, I saw him again. But alas! I could not touch him. He was in the act of lifting a girl down from her horse; doubtless it was her scream that I heard. She looked like a small farmer\u2019s or a peasant\u2019s daughter, and she carried a basket on her arm. Probably she was on her way to the early market at Zenda. Her horse was a stout, well shaped animal. Master Rupert lifted her down amid her shrieks\u2014the sight of him frightened her; but he treated her gently, laughed, kissed her, and gave her money. Then he jumped on the horse, sitting sideways like a woman; and then he waited for me. I, on my part, waited for him.", "29": "Presently he rode towards me, keeping his distance, however. He lifted up his hand, saying:", "30": "\u201cWhat did you in the Castle?\u201d", "31": "\u201cI killed three of your friends,\u201d said I.", "32": "\u201cWhat! You got to the cells?\u201d", "33": "\u201cYes.\u201d", "34": "\u201cAnd the King?\u201d", "35": "\u201cHe was hurt by Detchard before I killed Detchard, but I pray that he lives.\u201d", "36": "\u201cYou fool!\u201d said Rupert, pleasantly.", "37": "\u201cOne thing more I did.\u201d", "38": "\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d", "39": "\u201cI spared your life. I was behind you on the bridge, with a revolver in my hand.\u201d", "40": "\u201cNo? Faith, I was between two fires!\u201d", "41": "\u201cGet off your horse,\u201d I cried, \u201cand fight like a man.\u201d", "42": "\u201cBefore a lady!\u201d said he, pointing to the girl. \u201cFie, your Majesty!\u201d", "43": "Then in my rage, hardly knowing what I did, I rushed at him. For a moment he seemed to waver. Then he reined his horse in and stood waiting for me. On I went in my folly. I seized the bridle and I struck at him. He parried and thrust at me. I fell back a pace and rushed at him again; and this time I reached his face and laid his cheek open, and darted back almost before he could strike me. He seemed almost dazed at the fierceness of my attack; otherwise I think he must have killed me. I sank on my knee panting, expecting him to ride at me. And so he would have done, and then and there, I doubt not, one or both of us would have died; but at the moment there came a shout from behind us, and, looking round, I saw, just at the turn of the avenue, a man on a horse. He was riding hard, and he carried a revolver in his hand. It was Fritz von Tarlenheim, my faithful friend. Rupert saw him, and knew that the game was up. He checked his rush at me and flung his leg over the saddle, but yet for just a moment he waited. Leaning forward, he tossed his hair off his forehead and smiled, and said: \u201cAu revoir, Rudolf Rassendyll!\u201d", "44": "Then, with his cheek streaming blood, but his lips laughing and his body swaying with ease and grace, he bowed to me; and he bowed to the farm-girl, who had drawn near in trembling fascination, and he waved his hand to Fritz, who was just within range and let fly a shot at him. The ball came nigh doing its work, for it struck the sword he held, and he dropped the sword with an oath, wringing his fingers and clapped his heels hard on his horse\u2019s belly, and rode away at a gallop.", "45": "And I watched him go down the long avenue, riding as though he rode for his pleasure and singing as he went, for all there was that gash in his cheek.", "46": "Once again he turned to wave his hand, and then the gloom of thickets swallowed him and he was lost from our sight. Thus he vanished\u2014reckless and wary, graceful and graceless, handsome, debonair, vile, and unconquered. And I flung my sword passionately on the ground and cried to Fritz to ride after him. But Fritz stopped his horse, and leapt down and ran to me, and knelt, putting his arm about me. And indeed it was time, for the wound that Detchard had given me was broken forth afresh, and my blood was staining the ground.", "47": "\u201cThen give me the horse!\u201d I cried, staggering to my feet and throwing his arms off me. And the strength of my rage carried me so far as where the horse stood, and then I fell prone beside it. And Fritz knelt by me again.", "48": "\u201cFritz!\u201d I said.", "49": "\u201cAy, friend\u2014dear friend!\u201d he said, tender as a woman.", "50": "\u201cIs the King alive?\u201d", "51": "He took his handkerchief and wiped my lips, and bent and kissed me on the forehead.", "52": "\u201cThanks to the most gallant gentleman that lives,\u201d said he softly, \u201cthe King is alive!\u201d", "53": "The little farm-girl stood by us, weeping for fright and wide-eyed for wonder; for she had seen me at Zenda; and was not I, pallid, dripping, foul, and bloody as I was\u2014yet was not I the King?", "54": "And when I heard that the King was alive, I strove to cry \u201cHurrah!\u201d But I could not speak, and I laid my head back in Fritz\u2019s arms and closed my eyes, and I groaned; and then, lest Fritz should do me wrong in his thoughts, I opened my eyes and tried to say \u201cHurrah!\u201d again. But I could not. And being very tired, and now very cold, I huddled myself close up to Fritz, to get the warmth of him, and shut my eyes again and went to sleep."}, "CHAPTER 20": {"0": "In order to a full understanding of what had occurred in the Castle of Zenda, it is necessary to supplement my account of what I myself saw and did on that night by relating briefly what I afterwards learnt from Fritz and Madame de Mauban. The story told by the latter explained clearly how it happened that the cry which I had arranged as a stratagem and a sham had come, in dreadful reality, before its time, and had thus, as it seemed at the moment, ruined our hopes, while in the end it had favoured them. The unhappy woman, fired, I believe by a genuine attachment to the Duke of Strelsau, no less than by the dazzling prospects which a dominion over him opened before her eyes, had followed him at his request from Paris to Ruritania. He was a man of strong passions, but of stronger will, and his cool head ruled both. He was content to take all and give nothing. When she arrived, she was not long in finding that she had a rival in the Princess Flavia; rendered desperate, she stood at nothing which might give, or keep for her, her power over the duke. As I say, he took and gave not. Simultaneously, Antoinette found herself entangled in his audacious schemes. Unwilling to abandon him, bound to him by the chains of shame and hope, yet she would not be a decoy, nor, at his bidding, lure me to death. Hence the letters of warning she had written. Whether the lines she sent to Flavia were inspired by good or bad feeling, by jealousy or by pity, I do not know; but here also she served us well. When the duke went to Zenda, she accompanied him; and here for the first time she learnt the full measure of his cruelty, and was touched with compassion for the unfortunate King. From this time she was with us; yet, from what she told me, I know that she still (as women will) loved Michael, and trusted to gain his life, if not his pardon, from the King, as the reward for her assistance. His triumph she did not desire, for she loathed his crime, and loathed yet more fiercely what would be the prize of it\u2014his marriage with his cousin, Princess Flavia.", "1": "At Zenda new forces came into play\u2014the lust and daring of young Rupert. He was caught by her beauty, perhaps; perhaps it was enough for him that she belonged to another man, and that she hated him. For many days there had been quarrels and ill will between him and the duke, and the scene which I had witnessed in the duke\u2019s room was but one of many. Rupert\u2019s proposals to me, of which she had, of course, been ignorant, in no way surprised her when I related them; she had herself warned Michael against Rupert, even when she was calling on me to deliver her from both of them. On this night, then, Rupert had determined to have his will. When she had gone to her room, he, having furnished himself with a key to it, had made his entrance. Her cries had brought the duke, and there in the dark room, while she screamed, the men had fought; and Rupert, having wounded his master with a mortal blow, had, on the servants rushing in, escaped through the window as I have described. The duke\u2019s blood, spurting out, had stained his opponent\u2019s shirt; but Rupert, not knowing that he had dealt Michael his death, was eager to finish the encounter. How he meant to deal with the other three of the band, I know not. I dare say he did not think, for the killing of Michael was not premeditated. Antoinette, left alone with the duke, had tried to stanch his wound, and thus was she busied till he died; and then, hearing Rupert\u2019s taunts, she had come forth to avenge him. Me she had not seen, nor did she till I darted out of my ambush, and leapt after Rupert into the moat.", "2": "The same moment found my friends on the scene. They had reached the chateau in due time, and waited ready by the door. But Johann, swept with the rest to the rescue of the duke, did not open it; nay, he took a part against Rupert, putting himself forward more bravely than any in his anxiety to avert suspicion; and he had received a wound, in the embrasure of the window. Till nearly half-past two Sapt waited; then, following my orders, he had sent Fritz to search the banks of the moat. I was not there. Hastening back, Fritz told Sapt; and Sapt was for following orders still, and riding at full speed back to Tarlenheim; while Fritz would not hear of abandoning me, let me have ordered what I would. On this they disputed some few minutes; then Sapt, persuaded by Fritz, detached a party under Bernenstein to gallop back to Tarlenheim and bring up the marshal, while the rest fell to on the great door of the chateau. For several minutes it resisted them; then, just as Antoinette de Mauban fired at Rupert of Hentzau on the bridge, they broke in, eight of them in all: and the first door they came to was the door of Michael\u2019s room; and Michael lay dead across the threshold, with a sword-thrust through his breast. Sapt cried out at his death, as I had heard, and they rushed on the servants; but these, in fear, dropped their weapons, and Antoinette flung herself weeping at Sapt\u2019s feet. And all she cried was that I had been at the end of the bridge and leapt off. \u201cWhat of the prisoner?\u201d asked Sapt; but she shook her head. Then Sapt and Fritz, with the gentlemen behind them, crossed the bridge, slowly, warily, and without noise; and Fritz stumbled over the body of De Gautet in the way of the door. They felt him and found him dead.", "3": "Then they consulted, listening eagerly for any sound from the cells below; but there came none, and they were greatly afraid that the King\u2019s guards had killed him, and having pushed his body through the great pipe, had escaped the same way themselves. Yet, because I had been seen here, they had still some hope (thus indeed Fritz, in his friendship, told me); and going back to Michael\u2019s body, pushing aside Antoinette, who prayed by it, they found a key to the door which I had locked, and opened the door. The staircase was dark, and they would not use a torch at first, lest they should be more exposed to fire. But soon Fritz cried: \u201cThe door down there is open! See, there is light!\u201d So they went on boldly, and found none to oppose them. And when they came to the outer room and saw the Belgian, Bersonin, lying dead, they thanked God, Sapt saying: \u201cAy, he has been here.\u201d Then rushing into the King\u2019s cell, they found Detchard lying dead across the dead physician, and the King on his back with his chair by him. And Fritz cried: \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d and Sapt drove all out of the room except Fritz, and knelt down by the King; and, having learnt more of wounds and the sign of death than I, he soon knew that the King was not dead, nor, if properly attended, would die. And they covered his face and carried him to Duke Michael\u2019s room, and laid him there; and Antoinette rose from praying by the body of the duke and went to bathe the King\u2019s head and dress his wounds, till a doctor came. And Sapt, seeing I had been there, and having heard Antoinette\u2019s story, sent Fritz to search the moat and then the forest. He dared send no one else. And Fritz found my horse, and feared the worst. Then, as I have told, he found me, guided by the shout with which I had called on Rupert to stop and face me. And I think a man has never been more glad to find his own brother alive than was Fritz to come on me; so that, in love and anxiety for me, he thought nothing of a thing so great as would have been the death of Rupert Hentzau. Yet, had Fritz killed him, I should have grudged it.", "4": "The enterprise of the King\u2019s rescue being thus prosperously concluded, it lay on Colonel Sapt to secure secrecy as to the King ever having been in need of rescue. Antoinette de Mauban and Johann the keeper (who, indeed, was too much hurt to be wagging his tongue just now) were sworn to reveal nothing; and Fritz went forth to find\u2014not the King, but the unnamed friend of the King, who had lain in Zenda and flashed for a moment before the dazed eyes of Duke Michael\u2019s servants on the drawbridge. The metamorphosis had happened; and the King, wounded almost to death by the attacks of the gaolers who guarded his friend, had at last overcome them, and rested now, wounded but alive, in Black Michael\u2019s own room in the Castle. There he had been carried, his face covered with a cloak, from the cell; and thence orders issued, that if his friend were found, he should be brought directly and privately to the King, and that meanwhile messengers should ride at full speed to Tarlenheim, to tell Marshall Strakencz to assure the princess of the King\u2019s safety and to come himself with all speed to greet the King. The princess was enjoined to remain at Tarlenheim, and there await her cousin\u2019s coming or his further injunctions. Thus the King would come to his own again, having wrought brave deeds, and escaped, almost by a miracle, the treacherous assault of his unnatural brother.", "5": "This ingenious arrangement of my long-headed old friend prospered in every way, save where it encountered a force that often defeats the most cunning schemes. I mean nothing else than the pleasure of a woman. For, let her cousin and sovereign send what command he chose (or Colonel Sapt chose for him), and let Marshal Strakencz insist as he would, the Princess Flavia was in no way minded to rest at Tarlenheim while her lover lay wounded at Zenda; and when the Marshal, with a small suite, rode forth from Tarlenheim on the way to Zenda, the princess\u2019s carriage followed immediately behind, and in this order they passed through the town, where the report was already rife that the King, going the night before to remonstrate with his brother, in all friendliness, for that he held one of the King\u2019s friends in confinement in the Castle, had been most traitorously set upon; that there had been a desperate conflict; that the duke was slain with several of his gentlemen; and that the King, wounded as he was, had seized and held the Castle of Zenda. All of which talk made, as may be supposed, a mighty excitement: and the wires were set in motion, and the tidings came to Strelsau only just after orders had been sent thither to parade the troops and overawe the dissatisfied quarters of the town with a display of force.", "6": "Thus the Princess Flavia came to Zenda. And as she drove up the hill, with the Marshal riding by the wheel and still imploring her to return in obedience to the King\u2019s orders, Fritz von Tarlenheim, with the prisoner of Zenda, came to the edge of the forest. I had revived from my swoon, and walked, resting on Fritz\u2019s arm; and looking out from the cover of the trees, I saw the princess. Suddenly understanding from a glance at my companion\u2019s face that we must not meet her, I sank on my knees behind a clump of bushes. But there was one whom we had forgotten, but who followed us, and was not disposed to let slip the chance of earning a smile and maybe a crown or two; and, while we lay hidden, the little farm-girl came by us and ran to the princess, curtseying and crying:", "7": "\u201cMadame, the King is here\u2014in the bushes! May I guide you to him, madame?\u201d", "8": "\u201cNonsense, child!\u201d said old Strakencz; \u201cthe King lies wounded in the Castle.\u201d", "9": "\u201cYes, sir, he\u2019s wounded, I know; but he\u2019s there\u2014with Count Fritz\u2014and not at the Castle,\u201d she persisted.", "10": "\u201cIs he in two places, or are there two Kings?\u201d asked Flavia, bewildered. \u201cAnd how should he be there?\u201d", "11": "\u201cHe pursued a gentleman, madame, and they fought till Count Fritz came; and the other gentleman took my father\u2019s horse from me and rode away; but the King is here with Count Fritz. Why, madame, is there another man in Ruritania like the King?\u201d", "12": "\u201cNo, my child,\u201d said Flavia softly (I was told it afterwards), and she smiled and gave the girl money. \u201cI will go and see this gentleman,\u201d and she rose to alight from the carriage.", "13": "But at this moment Sapt came riding from the Castle, and, seeing the princess, made the best of a bad job, and cried to her that the King was well tended and in no danger.", "14": "\u201cIn the Castle?\u201d she asked.", "15": "\u201cWhere else, madame?\u201d said he, bowing.", "16": "\u201cBut this girl says he is yonder\u2014with Count Fritz.\u201d", "17": "Sapt turned his eyes on the child with an incredulous smile.", "18": "\u201cEvery fine gentleman is a King to such,\u201d said he.", "19": "\u201cWhy, he\u2019s as like the King as one pea to another, madame!\u201d cried the girl, a little shaken but still obstinate.", "20": "Sapt started round. The old Marshal\u2019s face asked unspoken questions. Flavia\u2019s glance was no less eloquent. Suspicion spread quick.", "21": "\u201cI\u2019ll ride myself and see this man,\u201d said Sapt hastily.", "22": "\u201cNay, I\u2019ll come myself,\u201d said the princess.", "23": "\u201cThen come alone,\u201d he whispered.", "24": "And she, obedient to the strange hinting in his face, prayed the Marshal and the rest to wait; and she and Sapt came on foot towards where we lay, Sapt waving to the farm-girl to keep at a distance. And when I saw them coming, I sat in a sad heap on the ground, and buried my face in my hands. I could not look at her. Fritz knelt by me, laying his hand on my shoulder.", "25": "\u201cSpeak low, whatever you say,\u201d I heard Sapt whisper as they came up; and the next thing I heard was a low cry\u2014half of joy, half of fear\u2014from the princess:", "26": "\u201cIt is he! Are you hurt?\u201d", "27": "And she fell on the ground by me, and gently pulled my hands away; but I kept my eyes to the ground.", "28": "\u201cIt is the King!\u201d she said. \u201cPray, Colonel Sapt, tell me where lay the wit of the joke you played on me?\u201d", "29": "We answered none of us; we three were silent before her. Regardless of them, she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me. Then Sapt spoke in a low hoarse whisper:", "30": "\u201cIt is not the King. Don\u2019t kiss him; he\u2019s not the King.\u201d", "31": "She drew back for a moment; then, with an arm still round my neck, she asked, in superb indignation:", "32": "\u201cDo I not know my love? Rudolf my love!\u201d", "33": "\u201cIt is not the King,\u201d said old Sapt again; and a sudden sob broke from tender-hearted Fritz.", "34": "It was the sob that told her no comedy was afoot.", "35": "\u201cHe is the King!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is the King\u2019s face\u2014the King\u2019s ring\u2014my ring! It is my love!\u201d", "36": "\u201cYour love, madame,\u201d said old Sapt, \u201cbut not the King. The King is there in the Castle. This gentleman\u2014\u201d", "37": "\u201cLook at me, Rudolf! look at me!\u201d she cried, taking my face between her hands. \u201cWhy do you let them torment me? Tell me what it means!\u201d", "38": "Then I spoke, gazing into her eyes.", "39": "\u201cGod forgive me, madame!\u201d I said. \u201cI am not the King!\u201d", "40": "I felt her hands clutch my cheeks. She gazed at me as never man\u2019s face was scanned yet. And I, silent again, saw wonder born, and doubt grow, and terror spring to life as she looked. And very gradually the grasp of her hands slackened; she turned to Sapt, to Fritz, and back to me: then suddenly she reeled forward and fell in my arms; and with a great cry of pain I gathered her to me and kissed her lips. Sapt laid his hand on my arm. I looked up in his face. And I laid her softly on the ground, and stood up, looking on her, cursing heaven that young Rupert\u2019s sword had spared me for this sharper pang."}, "CHAPTER 21": {"0": "It was night, and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the Castle of Zenda. The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d was gone, and the lights in the room across the moat twinkled in the darkness. All was still; the din and clash of strife were gone. I had spent the day hidden in the forest, from the time when Fritz had led me off, leaving Sapt with the princess. Under cover of dusk, muffled up, I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay. Though three men had died there\u2014two of them by my hand\u2014I was not troubled by ghosts. I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window, and was looking out on the black water; Johann, the keeper, still pale from his wound, but not much hurt besides, had brought me supper. He told me that the King was doing well, that he had seen the princess; that she and he, Sapt and Fritz, had been long together. Marshal Strakencz was gone to Strelsau; Black Michael lay in his coffin, and Antoinette de Mauban watched by him; had I not heard, from the chapel, priests singing mass for him?", "1": "Outside there were strange rumours afloat. Some said that the prisoner of Zenda was dead; some, that he had vanished yet alive; some, that he was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England; others, that he had discovered the Duke\u2019s plots, and had therefore been kidnapped by him. One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said only that they would say nothing, but they had suspicions that more was to be known than was known, if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew.", "2": "Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone, thinking, not of the future, but\u2014as a man is wont to do when stirring things have happened to him\u2014rehearsing the events of the past weeks, and wondering how strangely they had fallen out. And above me, in the stillness of the night, I heard the standards flapping against their poles, for Black Michael\u2019s banner hung there half-mast high, and above it the royal flag of Ruritania, floating for one night more over my head. Habit grows so quick, that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer for me.", "3": "Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room. I was standing then by the window; the glass was opened, and I was idly fingering the cement which clung to the masonry where \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d had been. He told me briefly that the King wanted me, and together we crossed the drawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael\u2019s.", "4": "The King was lying there in bed; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in attendance on him, and whispered to me that my visit must be brief. The King held out his hand and shook mine. Fritz and the doctor withdrew to the window.", "5": "I took the King\u2019s ring from my finger and placed it on his.", "6": "\u201cI have tried not to dishonour it, sire,\u201d said I.", "7": "\u201cI can\u2019t talk much to you,\u201d he said, in a weak voice. \u201cI have had a great fight with Sapt and the Marshal\u2014for we have told the Marshal everything. I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me, and tell everyone of what you had done; and you would have been my best and nearest friend, Cousin Rudolf. But they tell me I must not, and that the secret must be kept\u2014if kept it can be.\u201d", "8": "\u201cThey are right, sire. Let me go.

Cousin, I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else. You have shown me how to play the King.\u201d", "10": "\u201cSire,\u201d said I. \u201cI can take no praise from you. It is by the narrowest grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother.\u201d", "11": "He turned inquiring eyes on me; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles, and he had no strength to question me. His glance fell on Flavia\u2019s ring, which I wore. I thought he would question me about it; but, after fingering it idly, he let his head fall on his pillow.", "12": "\u201cI don\u2019t know when I shall see you again,\u201d he said faintly, almost listlessly.", "13": "\u201cIf I can ever serve you again, sire,\u201d I answered.", "14": "His eyelids closed. Fritz came with the doctor. I kissed the King\u2019s hand, and let Fritz lead me away. I have never seen the King since.", "15": "Outside, Fritz turned, not to the right, back towards the drawbridge, but to the left, and without speaking led me upstairs, through a handsome corridor in the chateau.", "16": "\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.", "17": "Looking away from me, Fritz answered:", "18": "\u201cShe has sent for you. When it is over, come back to the bridge.

I found myself in a drawing-room, small and richly furnished. At first I thought that I was alone, for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles on the mantelpiece was very dim. But presently I discerned a woman\u2019s figure standing by the window. I knew it was the princess, and I walked up to her, fell on one knee, and carried the hand that hung by her side to my lips. She neither moved nor spoke. I rose to my feet, and, piercing the gloom with my eager eyes, saw her pale face and the gleam of her hair, and before I knew, I spoke softly:", "24": "\u201cFlavia!\u201d", "25": "She trembled a little, and looked round.

Then she laid her head against me, and I heard her murmur: \u201cMy darling, how hot your head is!\u201d", "29": "Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover\u2019s heart. I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption; but what I said now was:", "30": "\u201cI love you with all my heart and soul!\u201d", "31": "For what troubled and shamed her? Not her love for me, but the fear that I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King, and taken her kisses with a smothered smile.", "32": "\u201cWith all my life and heart,\u201d said I, as she clung to me. \u201cAlways, from the first moment I saw you in the Cathedral!

But God forgive me the wrong I\u2019ve done you!\u201d", "33": "\u201cThey made you do it!\u201d she said quickly; and she added, raising her head and looking in my eyes: \u201cIt might have made no difference if I\u2019d known it. It was always you, never the King!\u201d", "34": "\u201cI meant to tell you,\u201d said I. \u201cI was going to on the night of the ball in Strelsau, when Sapt interrupted me.

I love you. You are as good a gentleman as the King!\u201d", "43": "Then I was false to all that I should have held by. For I caught her in my arms and prayed her, in words that I will not write, to come with me, daring all Ruritania to take her from me. And for a while she listened, with wondering, dazzled eyes. But as her eyes looked on me, I grew ashamed, and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings, and at last I was silent.", "44": "She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall, while I sat on the edge of the sofa, trembling in every limb, knowing what I had done\u2014loathing it, obstinate not to undo it. So we rested a long time.", "45": "\u201cI am mad!\u201d I said sullenly.", "46": "\u201cI love your madness, dear,\u201d she answered.", "47": "Her face was away from me, but I caught the sparkle of a tear on her cheek. I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there.", "48": "\u201cIs love the only thing?\u201d she asked, in low, sweet tones that seemed to bring a calm even to my wrung heart. \u201cIf love were the only thing, I would follow you\u2014in rags, if need be\u2014to the world\u2019s end; for you hold my heart in the hollow of your hand!

I put my hand up and held hers.", "51": "\u201cI know people write and talk as if it were. Perhaps, for some, Fate lets it be. Ah, if I were one of them! But if love had been the only thing, you would have let the King die in his cell.\u201d", "52": "I kissed her hand.", "53": "\u201cHonour binds a woman too, Rudolf. My honour lies in being true to my country and my House.

I rose and took her hand.", "57": "\u201cDo what you will, or what you must,\u201d I said. \u201cI think God shows His purposes to such as you. My part is lighter; for your ring shall be on my finger and your heart in mine, and no touch save of your lips will ever be on mine. So, may God comfort you, my darling!\u201d", "58": "There struck on our ears the sound of singing. The priests in the chapel were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead. They seemed to chant a requiem over our buried joy, to pray forgiveness for our love that would not die.

Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me. Under their directions I changed my dress, and muffling my face, as I had done more than once before, I mounted with them at the door of the Castle, and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day, and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border of Ruritania. The train was not quite due, and I walked with them in a meadow by a little brook while we waited for it. They promised to send me all news; they overwhelmed me with kindness\u2014even old Sapt was touched to gentleness, while Fritz was half unmanned. I listened in a kind of dream to all they said. \u201cRudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!\u201d still rang in my ears\u2014a burden of sorrow and of love. At last they saw that I could not heed them, and we walked up and down in silence, till Fritz touched me on the arm, and I saw, a mile or more away, the blue smoke of the train. Then I held out a hand to each of them.", "63": "\u201cWe are all but half-men this morning,\u201d said I, smiling. \u201cBut we have been men, eh, Sapt and Fritz, old friends? We have run a good course between us.\u201d", "64": "\u201cWe have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne,\u201d said Sapt.", "65": "Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly, before I could discern his purpose or stay him, uncovered his head and bent as he used to do, and kissed my hand; and as I snatched it away, he said, trying to laugh:", "66": "\u201cHeaven doesn\u2019t always make the right men kings!\u201d", "67": "Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand.", "68": "\u201cThe devil has his share in most things,\u201d said he.", "69": "The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with the muffled face, but we took no notice of their glances. I stood with my two friends and waited till the train came up to us. Then we shook hands again, saying nothing; and both this time\u2014and, indeed, from old Sapt it seemed strange\u2014bared their heads, and so stood still till the train bore me away from their sight. So that it was thought some great man travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that morning; whereas, in truth it was only I, Rudolf Rassendyll, an English gentleman, a cadet of a good house, but a man of no wealth nor position, nor of much rank. They would have been disappointed to know that. Yet had they known all they would have looked more curiously still. For, be I what I might now, I had been for three months a King, which, if not a thing to be proud of, is at least an experience to have undergone. Doubtless I should have thought more of it, had there not echoed through the air, from the towers of Zenda that we were leaving far away, into my ears and into my heart the cry of a woman\u2019s love\u2014\u201cRudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!\u201d", "70": "Hark! I hear it now!"}, "CHAPTER 22": {"0": "The details of my return home can have but little interest. I went straight to the Tyrol and spent a quiet fortnight\u2014mostly on my back, for a severe chill developed itself; and I was also the victim of a nervous reaction, which made me weak as a baby. As soon as I had reached my quarters, I sent an apparently careless postcard to my brother, announcing my good health and prospective return. That would serve to satisfy the inquiries as to my whereabouts, which were probably still vexing the Prefect of the Police of Strelsau. I let my moustache and imperial grow again; and as hair comes quickly on my face, they were respectable, though not luxuriant, by the time that I landed myself in Paris and called on my friend George Featherly. My interview with him was chiefly remarkable for the number of unwilling but necessary falsehoods that I told; and I rallied him unmercifully when he told me that he had made up his mind that I had gone in the track of Madame de Mauban to Strelsau. The lady, it appeared, was back in Paris, but was living in great seclusion\u2014a fact for which gossip found no difficulty in accounting. Did not all the world know of the treachery and death of Duke Michael? Nevertheless, George bade Bertram Bertrand be of good cheer, \u201cfor,\u201d said he flippantly, \u201ca live poet is better than a dead duke.\u201d Then he turned on me and asked:", "1": "\u201cWhat have you been doing to your moustache?\u201d", "2": "\u201cTo tell the truth,\u201d I answered, assuming a sly air, \u201ca man now and then has reasons for wishing to alter his appearance. But it\u2019s coming on very well again.\u201d", "3": "\u201cWhat? Then I wasn\u2019t so far out! If not the fair Antoinette, there was a charmer?\u201d", "4": "\u201cThere is always a charmer,\u201d said I, sententiously.", "5": "But George would not be satisfied till he had wormed out of me (he took much pride in his ingenuity) an absolutely imaginary love-affair, attended with the proper soup\u00e7on of scandal, which had kept me all this time in the peaceful regions of the Tyrol. In return for this narrative, George regaled me with a great deal of what he called \u201cinside information\u201d (known only to diplomatists), as to the true course of events in Ruritania, the plots and counterplots. In his opinion, he told me, with a significant nod, there was more to be said for Black Michael than the public supposed; and he hinted at a well-founded suspicion that the mysterious prisoner of Zenda, concerning whom a good many paragraphs had appeared, was not a man at all, but (here I had much ado not to smile) a woman disguised as a man; and that strife between the King and his brother for this imaginary lady\u2019s favour was at the bottom of their quarrel.", "6": "\u201cPerhaps it was Madame de Mauban herself,\u201d I suggested.", "7": "\u201cNo!\u201d said George decisively, \u201cAntoinette de Mauban was jealous of her, and betrayed the duke to the King for that reason. And, to confirm what I say, it\u2019s well known that the Princess Flavia is now extremely cold to the King, after having been most affectionate.\u201d", "8": "At this point I changed the subject, and escaped from George\u2019s \u201cinspired\u201d delusions. But if diplomatists never know anything more than they had succeeded in finding out in this instance, they appear to me to be somewhat expensive luxuries.", "9": "While in Paris I wrote to Antoinette, though I did not venture to call upon her. I received in return a very affecting letter, in which she assured me that the King\u2019s generosity and kindness, no less than her regard for me, bound her conscience to absolute secrecy. She expressed the intention of settling in the country, and withdrawing herself entirely from society. Whether she carried out her designs, I have never heard; but as I have not met her, or heard news of her up to this time, it is probable that she did. There is no doubt that she was deeply attached to the Duke of Strelsau; and her conduct at the time of his death proved that no knowledge of the man\u2019s real character was enough to root her regard for him out of her heart.", "10": "I had one more battle left to fight\u2014a battle that would, I knew, be severe, and was bound to end in my complete defeat. Was I not back from the Tyrol, without having made any study of its inhabitants, institutions, scenery, fauna, flora, or other features? Had I not simply wasted my time in my usual frivolous, good-for-nothing way? That was the aspect of the matter which, I was obliged to admit, would present itself to my sister-in-law; and against a verdict based on such evidence, I had really no defence to offer. It may be supposed, then, that I presented myself in Park Lane in a shamefaced, sheepish fashion. On the whole, my reception was not so alarming as I had feared. It turned out that I had done, not what Rose wished, but\u2014the next best thing\u2014what she prophesied. She had declared that I should make no notes, record no observations, gather no materials. My brother, on the other hand, had been weak enough to maintain that a serious resolve had at length animated me.", "11": "When I returned empty-handed, Rose was so occupied in triumphing over Burlesdon that she let me down quite easily, devoting the greater part of her reproaches to my failure to advertise my friends of my whereabouts.", "12": "\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted a lot of time trying to find you,\u201d she said.", "13": "\u201cI know you have,\u201d said I. \u201cHalf our ambassadors have led weary lives on my account.

Presently he came back with a copy of the Illustrated London News. Opening the paper, he displayed a double-page engraving of the Coronation of Rudolf V at Strelsau. The photograph and the picture he laid side by side. I sat at the table fronting them; and, as I looked, I grew absorbed. My eye travelled from my own portrait to Sapt, to Strakencz, to the rich robes of the Cardinal, to Black Michael\u2019s face, to the stately figure of the princess by his side. Long I looked and eagerly. I was roused by my brother\u2019s hand on my shoulder. He was gazing down at me with a puzzled expression.", "29": "\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable likeness, you see,\u201d said I. \u201cI really think I had better not go to Ruritania.\u201d", "30": "Rose, though half convinced, would not abandon her position.", "31": "\u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse,\u201d she said pettishly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything.

I had been a king!", "36": "So pretty Rose left us in dudgeon; and Burlesdon, lighting a cigarette, looked at me still with that curious gaze.", "37": "\u201cThat picture in the paper\u2014\u201d he said.", "38": "\u201cWell, what of it? It shows that the King of Ruritania and your humble servant are as like as two peas.\u201d", "39": "My brother shook his head.", "40": "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should know you from the man in the photograph.\u201d", "41": "\u201cAnd not from the picture in the paper?\u201d", "42": "\u201cI should know the photograph from the picture: the picture\u2019s very like the photograph, but\u2014\u201d", "43": "\u201cWell?\u201d", "44": "\u201cIt\u2019s more like you!\u201d said my brother.", "45": "My brother is a good man and true\u2014so that, for all that he is a married man and mighty fond of his wife, he should know any secret of mine. But this secret was not mine, and I could not tell it to him.", "46": "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much like me as the photograph,\u201d said I boldly. \u201cBut, anyhow, Bob, I won\u2019t go to Strelsau.\u201d", "47": "\u201cNo, don\u2019t go to Strelsau, Rudolf,\u201d said he.", "48": "And whether he suspects anything, or has a glimmer of the truth, I do not know. If he has, he keeps it to himself, and he and I never refer to it. And we let Sir Jacob Borrodaile find another attache.", "49": "Since all these events whose history I have set down happened I have lived a very quiet life at a small house which I have taken in the country. The ordinary ambitions and aims of men in my position seem to me dull and unattractive. I have little fancy for the whirl of society, and none for the jostle of politics. Lady Burlesdon utterly despairs of me; my neighbours think me an indolent, dreamy, unsociable fellow. Yet I am a young man; and sometimes I have a fancy\u2014the superstitious would call it a presentiment\u2014that my part in life is not yet altogether played; that, somehow and some day, I shall mix again in great affairs, I shall again spin policies in a busy brain, match my wits against my enemies\u2019, brace my muscles to fight a good fight and strike stout blows. Such is the tissue of my thoughts as, with gun or rod in hand, I wander through the woods or by the side of the stream. Whether the fancy will be fulfilled, I cannot tell\u2014still less whether the scene that, led by memory, I lay for my new exploits will be the true one\u2014for I love to see myself once again in the crowded streets of Strelsau, or beneath the frowning keep of the Castle of Zenda.", "50": "Thus led, my broodings leave the future, and turn back on the past. Shapes rise before me in long array\u2014the wild first revel with the King, the rush with my brave tea-table, the night in the moat, the pursuit in the forest: my friends and my foes, the people who learnt to love and honour me, the desperate men who tried to kill me. And, from amidst these last, comes one who alone of all of them yet moves on earth, though where I know not, yet plans (as I do not doubt) wickedness, yet turns women\u2019s hearts to softness and men\u2019s to fear and hate. Where is young Rupert of Hentzau\u2014the boy who came so nigh to beating me? When his name comes into my head, I feel my hand grip and the blood move quicker through my veins: and the hint of Fate\u2014the presentiment\u2014seems to grow stronger and more definite, and to whisper insistently in my ear that I have yet a hand to play with young Rupert; therefore I exercise myself in arms, and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth must leave me.", "51": "One break comes every year in my quiet life. Then I go to Dresden, and there I am met by my dear friend and companion, Fritz von Tarlenheim. Last time, his pretty wife Helga came, and a lusty crowing baby with her. And for a week Fritz and I are together, and I hear all of what falls out in Strelsau; and in the evenings, as we walk and smoke together, we talk of Sapt, and of the King, and often of young Rupert; and, as the hours grow small, at last we speak of Flavia. For every year Fritz carries with him to Dresden a little box; in it lies a red rose, and round the stalk of the rose is a slip of paper with the words written: \u201cRudolf\u2014Flavia\u2014always.\u201d And the like I send back by him. That message, and the wearing of the rings, are all that now bind me and the Queen of Ruritania. For\u2014nobler, as I hold her, for the act\u2014she has followed where her duty to her country and her House led her, and is the wife of the King, uniting his subjects to him by the love they bear to her, giving peace and quiet days to thousands by her self-sacrifice. There are moments when I dare not think of it, but there are others when I rise in spirit to where she ever dwells; then I can thank God that I love the noblest lady in the world, the most gracious and beautiful, and that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high duty.", "52": "Shall I see her face again\u2014the pale face and the glorious hair? Of that I know nothing; Fate has no hint, my heart no presentiment. I do not know. In this world, perhaps\u2014nay, it is likely\u2014never. And can it be that somewhere, in a manner whereof our flesh-bound minds have no apprehension, she and I will be together again, with nothing to come between us, nothing to forbid our love? That I know not, nor wiser heads than mine. But if it be never\u2014if I can never hold sweet converse again with her, or look upon her face, or know from her her love; why, then, this side the grave, I will live as becomes the man whom she loves; and, for the other side, I must pray a dreamless sleep."}}}]
