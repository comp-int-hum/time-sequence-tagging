I won\u2019t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.\u201d The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.", "1": "A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.", "2": "It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.", "3": "AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices.

Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: \u201cIf you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.\u201d The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:", "5": "\u201cYou ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\u201d", "6": "A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened.

When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons\u2019 hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: \u201cMy sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.\u201d", "9": "A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him.

I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.\u201d", "11": "THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, \u201cOh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.\u201d And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.", "12": "A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: \u201cWhy, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.\u201d", "13": "In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.", "14": "A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: \u201cO you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.\u201d", "15": "A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed him: \u201cPut your shoulders to the wheels, my man.

A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, \u201cWhy did you not treasure up food during the summer?\u201d He replied, \u201cI had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.\u201d They then said in derision: \u201cIf you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.\u201d", "18": "A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: \u201cWhy do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.\u201d The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: \u201cO, master!

He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.", "21": "A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: \u201cI am sure than I can see, Mother!\u201d In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The young Mole said, \u201cIt is a pebble.\u201d His Mother exclaimed: \u201cMy son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.\u201d", "22": "A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said: \u201cJust now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own escape from him in safety.\u201d", "23": "A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who replied, laughing: \u201cThough you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.\u201d The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.", "24": "Slow but steady wins the race.", "25": "THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most beautiful.

With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. \u201cPray save me, Master,\u201d he said, \u201cand let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers\u2014they are not the least like those of a Crane.\u201d The Farmer laughed aloud and said, \u201cIt may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.\u201d", "27": "Birds of a feather flock together.", "28": "ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. \u201cOh,\u201d cried the Farmer with his last breath, \u201cI am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.\u201d", "29": "The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.", "30": "A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, \u201cYou are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?\u201d She smiled, and said: \u201cI know full well, my son, that all you say is true.

They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure.", "38": "A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. \u201cI will give you,\u201d she said, \u201call the riches of the Red Sea.\u201d \u201cI will teach you to fly then,\u201d said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to pieces.

They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented \u201ca Lion strangled by a Man.\u201d The traveler pointed to it and said: \u201cSee there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.\u201d The Lion replied: \u201cThis statue was made by one of you men.

For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, \u201cIt is time for us to be off to Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.\u201d", "45": "If words suffice not, blows must follow.", "46": "A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. \u201cWhat a selfish Dog!\u201d said one of them to his companions; \u201che cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.\u201d", "47": "A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. \u201cIf,\u201d said he, \u201cyou will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.\u201d The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat\u2019s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, \u201cYou foolish old fellow!

One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. \u201cHe gave me this advice,\u201d his companion replied. \u201cNever travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.\u201d", "50": "Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.", "51": "A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.

Supposing that the Swan\u2019s splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools.

One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, \u201cPray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.\u201d", "60": "A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful distance, and asked him how he was. \u201cI am very middling,\u201d replied the Lion, \u201cbut why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said the Fox. \u201cI notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.\u201d", "61": "He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.", "62": "A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit. \u201cAlas!\u201d said the Horse, \u201cif you really wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.\u201d", "63": "A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master\u2019s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: \u201cI have brought it all on myself!

He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him.

The Shepherds discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: \u201cI remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.\u201d", "415": "AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard work.

Sardis, the capital of Lydia; Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient colony in Thrace; and Cotiaeum, the chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend for the distinction of being the birthplace of Aesop. Although the honor thus claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as established facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. He is, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave. He was owned by two masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon, the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning and wit. One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of Greece, was the permission to take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, like the philosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times, raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a position of high renown. In his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed, he travelled through many countries, and among others came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia, the great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men. He met at the court of Croesus with Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is related so to have pleased his royal master, by the part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers, that he applied to him an expression which has since passed into a proverb, \u201c\u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a6\u03c1\u1f7b\u03be.\u201d \u201cThe Phrygian has spoken better than all.\u201d", "425": "On the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of State. In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different petty republics of Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth, and at another in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his wise fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus. One of these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus, was the occasion of his death. Having been sent to Delphi with a large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and sent it back to his master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment, accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his sacred character as ambassador, executed him as a public criminal. This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged. The citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities, until they made a public reparation of their crime; and, \u201cThe blood of Aesop\u201d became a well-known adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished. Neither did the great fabulist lack posthumous honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at Athens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek sculptors. Phaedrus thus immortalizes the event:", "426": "Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici, Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi: Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam; Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.", "427": "These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. They were first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard Bachet de Mezeriac, who declined the honor of being tutor to Louis XIII of France, from his desire to devote himself exclusively to literature. He published his Life of Aesop, Anno Domini 1632. The later investigations of a host of English and German scholars have added very little to the facts given by M. Mezeriac. The substantial truth of his statements has been confirmed by later criticism and inquiry. It remains to state, that prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop was from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. His life was prefixed to all the early editions of these fables, and was republished as late as 1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of Aesop. This life by Planudes contains, however, so small an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque deformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally condemned as false, puerile, and unauthentic. 101 It is given up in the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the slightest credit. G.F.T.", "428": "THE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular modes of conveying instruction. Each is distinguished by its own special characteristics. The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story either founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and not necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson. The Parable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer, or reader. The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from both of these. It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning, and that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful introduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to either Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or political truth. The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements, ever aims at one great end and purpose representation of human motive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser. Thus the superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy. The true fabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function. He is neither a narrator, nor an allegorist. He is a great teacher, a corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue. In this consists the superiority of the Fable over the Tale or the Parable. The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a merry guise, to convey instruction. Phaedrus, the great imitator of Aesop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true office of the writer of fables.", "429": "Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet, Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.", "430": "The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. \u201cThe fable,\u201d says Professor K. O. Mueller, \u201coriginated in Greece in an intentional travestie of human affairs. The \u2018ainos,\u2019 as its name denotes, is an admonition, or rather a reproof veiled, either from fear of an excess of frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and authentic account of the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same.\" 1", "431": "The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1) the narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a careful maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious personages introduced into it. The narration should relate to one simple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances. The moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven with, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation. The introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular consent. The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass patient. Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest observance of these rules. They are occupied with one short narrative, from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately associated. \u201c\u2018Tis the simple manner,\u201d says Dodsley, 2 \u201cin which the morals of Aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him, and gives him the preference over all other mythologists. His \u2018Mountain delivered of a Mouse,\u2019 produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall, as it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of flattery. There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of accumulated reflections.\" 3 An equal amount of praise is due for the consistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously introduced, are marked. While they are made to depict the motives and passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or rapacity.", "432": "These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all the fables in this collection. Many of them lack that unity of design, that close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice in the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and excellency of true Aesopian fable. This inferiority of some to others is sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of these fables. The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of Aesop. Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he lived. Thus, the fable of the \u201cHawk and the Nightingale\u201d is related by Hesiod; 4 the \u201cEagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own Feathers,\u201d by Aeschylus; 5 the \u201cFox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,\u201d by Archilochus. 6 Many of them again are of later origin, and are to be traced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection, though thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of Aesop, rightfully bears his name, because he composed so large a number (all framed in the same mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and stamped with the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to himself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables, and the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since borne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding ages, the position of the first of moralists. 7", "433": "The fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and for a longtime were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition. Socrates ismentioned by Plato 8as having employed his time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacredship from Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning some ofthese fables into verse, but he thus versified only such as he remembered.Demetrius Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to havemade the first collection of these fables. Phaedrus, a slave by birth or bysubsequent misfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a freedman,imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the commencement of theChristian era. Aphthonius, a rhetorician of Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatiseon, and converted into Latin prose, some of these fables. This translation isthe more worthy of notice, as it illustrates a custom of common use, both inthese and in later times. The rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed togive the Fables of Aesop as an exercise to their scholars, not only invitingthem to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practice and to perfectthemselves thereby in style and rules of grammar, by making for themselves newand various versions of the fables. Ausonius, 9the friend of the Emperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in theWestern Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse, which JulianusTitianus, a contemporary writer of no great name, translated into prose.Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius, put some of these fables into Latinelegiacs, which are given by Nevelet (in a book we shall refer to hereafter),and are occasionally incorporated with the editions of Phaedrus.", "434": "Seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables of Aesop. During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors were the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an Asiatic court, that we next find honors paid to the name and memory of Aesop. Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a collection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables. Little is known of his history. Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in his monastery. He took an active part in public affairs. In 1327 A.D. he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the Emperor Andronicus the Elder. This brought him into immediate contact with the Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of the Eastern Church. Planudes has been exposed to a two-fold accusation. He is charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of Babrias (to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of this Preface), and to have had the bad taste \u201cto transpose,\u201d or to turn his poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the other hand, never to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to have himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name of the famous Greek fabulist. The truth lies between these two extremes. Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted some that were current in his day; but there is an abundance of unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with the veritable fables of Aesop, although the versions he had access to were probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers. His collection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source or foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the learned.", "435": "The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop to their high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked for in the West rather than in the East. The calamities gradually thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D. combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning in Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest in the Fables of Aesop is closely identified. These fables, indeed, were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted attention. They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and the ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of that day. Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Aesop.", "436": "These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended circulation by the agency of the printing press. Bonus Accursius, as early as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by Planudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into English, and printed at his press in West-minster Abbey, 1485. 10 It must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent traces of its influence on these fables, 11 by causing the interpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which were so frequently introduced into the public discourses of the great preachers of those days, and of which specimens are yet to be found in the extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette. 12 The publication of this era which most probably has influenced these fables, is the \u201cLiber Facetiarum,\" 13 a book consisting of a hundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from which the two fables of the \u201cMiller, his Son, and the Ass,\u201d and the \u201cFox and the Woodcutter,\u201d are undoubtedly selected.", "437": "The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany, and their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to them by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the Romish ecclesiastics. The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an active part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found time, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the students in the university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor. Martin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the celebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I, king of Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Aesop next after the Holy Scriptures. In 1546 A.D. the second printed edition of the collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from the printing-press of Robert Stephens, in which were inserted some additional fables from a MS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.", "438": "The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables of Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the early part of the seventeenth century. In the year 1610, a learned Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of these fables, in a work entitled \u201cMythologia Aesopica.\u201d This was a noble effort to do honor to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect collection of Aesopian fables ever yet published. It consisted, in addition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in the various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables (never before published) from MSS. in the Library of the Vatican, of forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias. It also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phaedrus, Avienus, and other authors. This volume of Nevelet forms a complete \u201cCorpus Fabularum Aesopicarum;\u201d and to his labors Aesop owes his restoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great teachers of mankind. During the interval of three centuries which has elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet\u2019s, no book, with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation than Aesop\u2019s Fables. They have been translated into the greater number of the languages both of Europe and of the East, and have been read, and will be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan, and Christian. They are, at the present time, not only engrafted into the literature of the civilized world, but are familiar as household words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of all countries.", "439": "This collection of Nevelet\u2019s is the great culminating point in the history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian Fables. It is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea, which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of circumstances. Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named Babrias would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of Aesopian Fables. This intimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a full understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with the writings that bear his name.", "440": "The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might not unfitlybe enumerated among the curiosities of literature. He is generally supposed tohave been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the Ionic Colonies, but the exactperiod in which he lived and wrote is yet unsettled. He is placed, by onecritic,14as far back as the institution of the Achaian League, B.C. 250; by another aslate as the Emperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him acontemporary with Phaedrus in the time of Augustus. At whatever time he wrotehis version of Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirelydisappeared, and to have been lost sight of. His name is mentioned by Avienus;by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of the eleventh century, who givesin his lexicon several isolated verses of his version of the fables; and byJohn Tzetzes, a grammarian and poet of Constantinople, who lived during thelatter half of the twelfth century. Nevelet, in the preface to the volume whichwe have described, points out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the workof Aesop, as they contain a reference in two places to \u201cHolymonks,\u201d and give a verse from the Epistle of St. James as an\u201cEpimith\u201d to one of the fables, and suggests Babrias as theirauthor. Francis Vavassor,15a learned French jesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, andproduced further proofs from internal evidence, from the use of the wordPiraeus in describing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not given tilltwo hundred years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern words,that many of these fables must have been at least committed to writingposterior to the time of Aesop, and more boldly suggests Babrias as theirauthor or collector.16These various references to Babrias induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at the closeof the seventeenth century, to examine more minutely the existing versions ofAesop\u2019s Fables, and he maintained that many of them could, with a slightchange of words, be resolved into the Scazonic17iambics, in which Babrias is known to have written: and, with a greater freedomthan the evidence then justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claimto the exclusive authorship of these fables. Such a seemingly extravaganttheory, thus roundly asserted, excited much opposition. Dr. Bentley18met with an able antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford, the Hon.Mr. Charles Boyle,19afterwards Earl of Orrery. Their letters and disputations on this subject,enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning, will ever bear aconspicuous place in the literary history of the seventeenth century. Thearguments of Dr. Bentley were yet further defended a few years later by Mr.Thomas Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions thathe might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. Mr.Tyrwhitt published, A.D. 1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a collection ofhis fables in choliambic meter found in a MS. in the Bodleian Library atOxford. Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian, contributed further testimony tothe correctness of the supposition that Babrias had made a veritable collectionof fables by printing from a MS. contained in the Vatican library severalfables never before published. In the year 1844, however, new and unexpectedlight was thrown upon this subject. A veritable copy of Babrias was found in amanner as singular as were the MSS. of Quinctilian\u2019s Institutes, and ofCicero\u2019s Orations by Poggio in the monastery of St. Gall A.D. 1416. M.Menoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction toKing Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a commission to search for ancientMSS., and in carrying out his instructions he found a MS. at the convent of St.Laura, on Mount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected andwished-for choliambic version of Babrias. This MS. was found to be divided intotwo books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five, and the otherninety-five fables. This discovery attracted very general attention, not onlyas confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures so boldly made by a longchain of critics, but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures tendingto establish the reputation, and to confirm the antiquity and authenticity ofthe great mass of Aesopian Fable. The Fables thus recovered were soonpublished. They found a most worthy editor in the late distinguished Sir GeorgeCornewall Lewis, and a translator equally qualified for his task, in theReverend James Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, andhimself a relation of their English editor. Thus, after an eclipse of manycenturies, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable collector ofveritable Aesopian Fables.", "441": "The following are the sources from which the present translation hasbeen prepared: Babrii Fabulae Aesopeae.

Snow fills the gorges, hangs in scarfs on the great slopes, and on the peaks the fiery sunshine is gathered up as by a burning-glass.", "1": "Howard Archie is standing at the window of his private room in the offices of the San Felipe Mining Company, on the sixth floor of the Raton Building, looking off at the mountain glories of his State while he gives dictation to his secretary. He is ten years older than when we saw him last, and emphatically ten years more prosperous. A decade of coming into things has not so much aged him as it has fortified, smoothed, and assured him. His sandy hair and imperial conceal whatever gray they harbor. He has not grown heavier, but more flexible, and his massive shoulders carry fifty years and the control of his great mining interests more lightly than they carried forty years and a country practice. In short, he is one of the friends to whom we feel grateful for having got on in the world, for helping to keep up the general temperature and our own confidence in life. He is an acquaintance that one would hurry to overtake and greet among a hundred. In his warm handshake and generous smile there is the stimulating cordiality of good fellows come into good fortune and eager to pass it on; something that makes one think better of the lottery of life and resolve to try again.", "2": "When Archie had finished his morning mail, he turned away from the window and faced his secretary. \u201cDid anything come up yesterday afternoon while I was away, T. B.?\u201d", "3": "Thomas Burk turned over the leaf of his calendar. \u201cGovernor Alden sent down to say that he wanted to see you before he sends his letter to the Board of Pardons. Asked if you could go over to the State House this morning.\u201d", "4": "Archie shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI'll think about it.\u201d", "5": "The young man grinned.", "6": "\u201cAnything else?\u201d his chief continued.", "7": "T. B. swung round in his chair with a look of interest on his shrewd, clean-shaven face. \u201cOld Jasper Flight was in, Dr. Archie. I never expected to see him alive again. Seems he's tucked away for the winter with a sister who's a housekeeper at the Oxford. He's all crippled up with rheumatism, but as fierce after it as ever. Wants to know if you or the company won't grub-stake him again. Says he's sure of it this time; had located something when the snow shut down on him in December. He wants to crawl out at the first break in the weather, with that same old burro with the split ear. He got somebody to winter the beast for him. He's superstitious about that burro, too; thinks it's divinely guided. You ought to hear the line of talk he put up here yesterday; said when he rode in his carriage, that burro was a-going to ride along with him.\u201d", "8": "Archie laughed. \u201cDid he leave you his address?\u201d", "9": "\u201cHe didn't neglect anything,\u201d replied the clerk cynically.", "10": "\u201cWell, send him a line and tell him to come in again. I like to hear him. Of all the crazy prospectors I've ever known, he's the most interesting, because he's really crazy. It's a religious conviction with him, and with most of 'em it's a gambling fever or pure vagrancy. But Jasper Flight believes that the Almighty keeps the secret of the silver deposits in these hills, and gives it away to the deserving. He's a downright noble figure. Of course I'll stake him! As long as he can crawl out in the spring. He and that burro are a sight together. The beast is nearly as white as Jasper; must be twenty years old.\u201d", "11": "\u201cIf you stake him this time, you won't have to again,\u201d said T. B. knowingly. \u201cHe'll croak up there, mark my word. Says he never ties the burro at night now, for fear he might be called sudden, and the beast would starve. I guess that animal could eat a lariat rope, all right, and enjoy it.\u201d", "12": "\u201cI guess if we knew the things those two have eaten, and haven't eaten, in their time, T. B., it would make us vegetarians.\u201d The doctor sat down and looked thoughtful. \u201cThat's the way for the old man to go. It would be pretty hard luck if he had to die in a hospital. I wish he could turn up something before he cashes in. But his kind seldom do; they're bewitched. Still, there was Stratton. I've been meeting Jasper Flight, and his side meat and tin pans, up in the mountains for years, and I'd miss him. I always halfway believe the fairy tales he spins me. Old Jasper Flight,\u201d Archie murmured, as if he liked the name or the picture it called up.", "13": "A clerk came in from the outer office and handed Archie a card. He sprang up and exclaimed, \u201cMr. Ottenburg? Bring him in.\u201d", "14": "Fred Ottenburg entered, clad in a long, fur-lined coat, holding a checked-cloth hat in his hand, his cheeks and eyes bright with the outdoor cold. The two men met before Archie's desk and their handclasp was longer than friendship prompts except in regions where the blood warms and quickens to meet the dry cold. Under the general keyingup of the altitude, manners take on a heartiness, a vivacity, that is one expression of the half-unconscious excitement which Colorado people miss when they drop into lower strata of air. The heart, we are told, wears out early in that high atmosphere, but while it pumps it sends out no sluggish stream. Our two friends stood gripping each other by the hand and smiling.", "15": "\u201cWhen did you get in, Fred? And what have you come for?\u201d Archie gave him a quizzical glance.", "16": "\u201cI've come to find out what you think you're doing out here,\u201d the younger man declared emphatically. \u201cI want to get next, I do. When can you see me?\u201d", "17": "\u201cAnything on to-night? Then suppose you dine with me. Where can I pick you up at five-thirty?\u201d", "18": "\u201cBixby's office, general freight agent of the Burlington.\u201d Ottenburg began to button his overcoat and drew on his gloves. \u201cI've got to have one shot at you before I go, Archie. Didn't I tell you Pinky Alden was a cheap squirt?\u201d", "19": "Alden's backer laughed and shook his head. \u201cOh, he's worse than that, Fred. It isn't polite to mention what he is, outside of the Arabian Nights. I guessed you'd come to rub it into me.\u201d", "20": "Ottenburg paused, his hand on the doorknob, his high color challenging the doctor's calm. \u201cI'm disgusted with you, Archie, for training with such a pup. A man of your experience!\u201d", "21": "\u201cWell, he's been an experience,\u201d Archie muttered. \u201cI'm not coy about admitting it, am I?\u201d", "22": "Ottenburg flung open the door. \u201cSmall credit to you. Even the women are out for capital and corruption, I hear. Your Governor's done more for the United Breweries in six months than I've been able to do in six years. He's the lily-livered sort we're looking for. Good-morning.\u201d", "23": "That afternoon at five o'clock Dr. Archie emerged from the State House after his talk with Governor Alden, and crossed the terrace under a saffron sky. The snow, beaten hard, was blue in the dusk; a day of blinding sunlight had not even started a thaw. The lights of the city twinkled pale below him in the quivering violet air, and the dome of the State House behind him was still red with the light from the west. Before he got into his car, the doctor paused to look about him at the scene of which he never tired. Archie lived in his own house on Colfax Avenue, where he had roomy grounds and a rose garden and a conservatory. His housekeeping was done by three Japanese boys, devoted and resourceful, who were able to manage Archie's dinner parties, to see that he kept his engagements, and to make visitors who stayed at the house so comfortable that they were always loath to go away.", "24": "Archie had never known what comfort was until he became a widower, though with characteristic delicacy, or dishonesty, he insisted upon accrediting his peace of mind to the San Felipe, to Time, to anything but his release from Mrs. Archie.", "25": "Mrs. Archie died just before her husband left Moonstone and came to Denver to live, six years ago. The poor woman's fight against dust was her undoing at last. One summer day when she was rubbing the parlor upholstery with gasoline,\u2014the doctor had often forbidden her to use it on any account, so that was one of the pleasures she seized upon in his absence,\u2014an explosion occurred. Nobody ever knew exactly how it happened, for Mrs. Archie was dead when the neighbors rushed in to save her from the burning house. She must have inhaled the burning gas and died instantly.", "26": "Moonstone severity relented toward her somewhat after her death. But even while her old cronies at Mrs. Smiley's millinery store said that it was a terrible thing, they added that nothing but a powerful explosive COULD have killed Mrs. Archie, and that it was only right the doctor should have a chance.", "27": "Archie's past was literally destroyed when his wife died. The house burned to the ground, and all those material reminders which have such power over people disappeared in an hour. His mining interests now took him to Denver so often that it seemed better to make his headquarters there. He gave up his practice and left Moonstone for good. Six months afterward, while Dr. Archie was living at the Brown Palace Hotel, the San Felipe mine began to give up that silver hoard which old Captain Harris had always accused it of concealing, and San Felipe headed the list of mining quotations in every daily paper, East and West. In a few years Dr. Archie was a very rich man. His mine was such an important item in the mineral output of the State, and Archie had a hand in so many of the new industries of Colorado and New Mexico, that his political influence was considerable. He had thrown it all, two years ago, to the new reform party, and had brought about the election of a governor of whose conduct he was now heartily ashamed. His friends believed that Archie himself had ambitious political plans."}, "II": {"0": "WHEN Ottenburg and his host reached the house on Colfax Avenue, they went directly to the library, a long double room on the second floor which Archie had arranged exactly to his own taste. It was full of books and mounted specimens of wild game, with a big writing-table at either end, stiff, old-fashioned engravings, heavy hangings and deep upholstery.", "1": "When one of the Japanese boys brought the cocktails, Fred turned from the fine specimen of peccoray he had been examining and said, \u201cA man is an owl to live in such a place alone, Archie. Why don't you marry? As for me, just because I can't marry, I find the world full of charming, unattached women, any one of whom I could fit up a house for with alacrity.\u201d", "2": "\u201cYou're more knowing than I.\u201d Archie spoke politely. \u201cI'm not very wide awake about women. I'd be likely to pick out one of the uncomfortable ones\u2014and there are a few of them, you know.\u201d He drank his cocktail and rubbed his hands together in a friendly way. \u201cMy friends here have charming wives, and they don't give me a chance to get lonely. They are very kind to me, and I have a great many pleasant friendships.\u201d", "3": "Fred put down his glass. \u201cYes, I've always noticed that women have confidence in you. You have the doctor's way of getting next. And you enjoy that kind of thing?\u201d", "4": "\u201cThe friendship of attractive women? Oh, dear, yes! I depend upon it a great deal.\u201d", "5": "The butler announced dinner, and the two men went downstairs to the dining-room. Dr. Archie's dinners were always good and well served, and his wines were excellent.", "6": "\u201cI saw the Fuel and Iron people to-day,\u201d Ottenburg said, looking up from his soup. \u201cTheir heart is in the right place. I can't see why in the mischief you ever got mixed up with that reform gang, Archie. You've got nothing to reform out here. The situation has always been as simple as two and two in Colorado; mostly a matter of a friendly understanding.\u201d", "7": "\u201cWell,\u201d\u2014Archie spoke tolerantly,\u2014\u201csome of the young fellows seemed to have red-hot convictions, and I thought it was better to let them try their ideas out.\u201d", "8": "Ottenburg shrugged his shoulders. \u201cA few dull young men who haven't ability enough to play the old game the old way, so they want to put on a new game which doesn't take so much brains and gives away more advertising that's what your anti-saloon league and vice commission amounts to. They provide notoriety for the fellows who can't distinguish themselves at running a business or practicing law or developing an industry. Here you have a mediocre lawyer with no brains and no practice, trying to get a look-in on something. He comes up with the novel proposition that the prostitute has a hard time of it, puts his picture in the paper, and the first thing you know, he's a celebrity. He gets the rake-off and she's just where she was before. How could you fall for a mouse-trap like Pink Alden, Archie?\u201d", "9": "Dr. Archie laughed as he began to carve. \u201cPink seems to get under your skin. He's not worth talking about. He's gone his limit. People won't read about his blameless life any more. I knew those interviews he gave out would cook him. They were a last resort. I could have stopped him, but by that time I'd come to the conclusion that I'd let the reformers down. I'm not against a general shaking-up, but the trouble with Pinky's crowd is they never get beyond a general writing-up. We gave them a chance to do something, and they just kept on writing about each other and what temptations they had overcome.\u201d", "10": "While Archie and his friend were busy with Colorado politics, the impeccable Japanese attended swiftly and intelligently to his duties, and the dinner, as Ottenburg at last remarked, was worthy of more profitable conversation.", "11": "\u201cSo it is,\u201d the doctor admitted. \u201cWell, we'll go upstairs for our coffee and cut this out. Bring up some cognac and arak, Tai,\u201d he added as he rose from the table.", "12": "They stopped to examine a moose's head on the stairway, and when they reached the library the pine logs in the fireplace had been lighted, and the coffee was bubbling before the hearth. Tai placed two chairs before the fire and brought a tray of cigarettes.", "13": "\u201cBring the cigars in my lower desk drawer, boy,\u201d the doctor directed. \u201cToo much light in here, isn't there, Fred? Light the lamp there on my desk, Tai.\u201d He turned off the electric glare and settled himself deep into the chair opposite Ottenburg's.", "14": "\u201cTo go back to our conversation, doctor,\u201d Fred began while he waited for the first steam to blow off his coffee; \u201cwhy don't you make up your mind to go to Washington? There'd be no fight made against you. I needn't say the United Breweries would back you. There'd be some KUDOS coming to us, too; backing a reform candidate.\u201d", "15": "Dr. Archie measured his length in his chair and thrust his large boots toward the crackling pitch-pine. He drank his coffee and lit a big black cigar while his guest looked over the assortment of cigarettes on the tray. \u201cYou say why don't I,\u201d the doctor spoke with the deliberation of a man in the position of having several courses to choose from, \u201cbut, on the other hand, why should I?\u201d He puffed away and seemed, through his half-closed eyes, to look down several long roads with the intention of luxuriously rejecting all of them and remaining where he was. \u201cI'm sick of politics. I'm disillusioned about serving my crowd, and I don't particularly want to serve yours. Nothing in it that I particularly want; and a man's not effective in politics unless he wants something for himself, and wants it hard. I can reach my ends by straighter roads. There are plenty of things to keep me busy. We haven't begun to develop our resources in this State; we haven't had a look in on them yet. That's the only thing that isn't fake\u2014making men and machines go, and actually turning out a product.\u201d", "16": "The doctor poured himself some white cordial and looked over the little glass into the fire with an expression which led Ottenburg to believe that he was getting at something in his own mind. Fred lit a cigarette and let his friend grope for his idea.", "17": "\u201cMy boys, here,\u201d Archie went on, \u201chave got me rather interested in Japan. Think I'll go out there in the spring, and come back the other way, through Siberia. I've always wanted to go to Russia.\u201d His eyes still hunted for something in his big fireplace. With a slow turn of his head he brought them back to his guest and fixed them upon him. \u201cJust now, I'm thinking of running on to New York for a few weeks,\u201d he ended abruptly.", "18": "Ottenburg lifted his chin. \u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed, as if he began to see Archie's drift. \u201cShall you see Thea?\u201d", "19": "\u201cYes.\u201d The doctor replenished his cordial glass. \u201cIn fact, I suspect I am going exactly TO see her. I'm getting stale on things here, Fred. Best people in the world and always doing things for me. I'm fond of them, too, but I've been with them too much. I'm getting ill-tempered, and the first thing I know I'll be hurting people's feelings. I snapped Mrs. Dandridge up over the telephone this afternoon when she asked me to go out to Colorado Springs on Sunday to meet some English people who are staying at the Antlers. Very nice of her to want me, and I was as sour as if she'd been trying to work me for something. I've got to get out for a while, to save my reputation.\u201d", "20": "To this explanation Ottenburg had not paid much attention. He seemed to be looking at a fixed point: the yellow glass eyes of a fine wildcat over one of the bookcases. \u201cYou've never heard her at all, have you?\u201d he asked reflectively. \u201cCurious, when this is her second season in New York.\u201d", "21": "\u201cI was going on last March. Had everything arranged. And then old Cap Harris thought he could drive his car and me through a lamp-post and I was laid up with a compound fracture for two months. So I didn't get to see Thea.\u201d", "22": "Ottenburg studied the red end of his cigarette attentively. \u201cShe might have come out to see you. I remember you covered the distance like a streak when she wanted you.\u201d", "23": "Archie moved uneasily. \u201cOh, she couldn't do that. She had to get back to Vienna to work on some new parts for this year. She sailed two days after the New York season closed.\u201d", "24": "\u201cWell, then she couldn't, of course.\u201d Fred smoked his cigarette close and tossed the end into the fire. \u201cI'm tremendously glad you're going now. If you're stale, she'll jack you up. That's one of her specialties. She got a rise out of me last December that lasted me all winter.\u201d", "25": "\u201cOf course,\u201d the doctor apologized, \u201cyou know so much more about such things. I'm afraid it will be rather wasted on me. I'm no judge of music.\u201d", "26": "\u201cNever mind that.\u201d The younger man pulled himself up in his chair. \u201cShe gets it across to people who aren't judges. That's just what she does.\u201d He relapsed into his former lassitude. \u201cIf you were stone deaf, it wouldn't all be wasted. It's a great deal to watch her. Incidentally, you know, she is very beautiful. Photographs give you no idea.\u201d", "27": "Dr. Archie clasped his large hands under his chin. \u201cOh, I'm counting on that. I don't suppose her voice will sound natural to me. Probably I wouldn't know it.\u201d", "28": "Ottenburg smiled. \u201cYou'll know it, if you ever knew it. It's the same voice, only more so. You'll know it.\u201d", "29": "\u201cDid you, in Germany that time, when you wrote me? Seven years ago, now. That must have been at the very beginning.\u201d", "30": "\u201cYes, somewhere near the beginning. She sang one of the Rhine daughters.\u201d Fred paused and drew himself up again. \u201cSure, I knew it from the first note. I'd heard a good many young voices come up out of the Rhine, but, by gracious, I hadn't heard one like that!\u201d He fumbled for another cigarette. \u201cMahler was conducting that night. I met him as he was leaving the house and had a word with him. 'Interesting voice you tried out this evening,' I said. He stopped and smiled. 'Miss Kronborg, you mean? Yes, very. She seems to sing for the idea. Unusual in a young singer.' I'd never heard him admit before that a singer could have an idea. She not only had it, but she got it across. The Rhine music, that I'd known since I was a boy, was fresh to me, vocalized for the first time. You realized that she was beginning that long story, adequately, with the end in view. Every phrase she sang was basic. She simply WAS the idea of the Rhine music.\u201d Ottenburg rose and stood with his back to the fire. \u201cAnd at the end, where you don't see the maidens at all, the same thing again: two pretty voices AND the Rhine voice.\u201d Fred snapped his fingers and dropped his hand.", "31": "The doctor looked up at him enviously. \u201cYou see, all that would be lost on me,\u201d he said modestly. \u201cI don't know the dream nor the interpretation thereof. I'm out of it. It's too bad that so few of her old friends can appreciate her.\u201d", "32": "\u201cTake a try at it,\u201d Fred encouraged him. \u201cYou'll get in deeper than you can explain to yourself. People with no personal interest do that.\u201d", "33": "\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Archie diffidently, \u201cthat college German, gone to seed, wouldn't help me out much. I used to be able to make my German patients understand me.\u201d", "34": "\u201cSure it would!\u201d cried Ottenburg heartily. \u201cDon't be above knowing your libretto. That's all very well for musicians, but common mortals like you and me have got to know what she's singing about. Get out your dictionary and go at it as you would at any other proposition. Her diction is beautiful, and if you know the text you'll get a great deal. So long as you're going to hear her, get all that's coming to you. You bet in Germany people know their librettos by heart! You Americans are so afraid of stooping to learn anything.\u201d", "35": "\u201cI AM a little ashamed,\u201d Archie admitted. \u201cI guess that's the way we mask our general ignorance. However, I'll stoop this time; I'm more ashamed not to be able to follow her. The papers always say she's such a fine actress.\u201d He took up the tongs and began to rearrange the logs that had burned through and fallen apart. \u201cI suppose she has changed a great deal?\u201d he asked absently.", "36": "\u201cWe've all changed, my dear Archie,\u2014she more than most of us. Yes, and no. She's all there, only there's a great deal more of her. I've had only a few words with her in several years. It's better not, when I'm tied up this way. The laws are barbarous, Archie.\u201d", "37": "\u201cYour wife is\u2014still the same?\u201d the doctor asked sympathetically.", "38": "\u201cAbsolutely. Hasn't been out of a sanitarium for seven years now. No prospect of her ever being out, and as long as she's there I'm tied hand and foot. What does society get out of such a state of things, I'd like to know, except a tangle of irregularities? If you want to reform, there's an opening for you!\u201d", "39": "\u201cIt's bad, oh, very bad; I agree with you!\u201d Dr. Archie shook his head. \u201cBut there would be complications under another system, too. The whole question of a young man's marrying has looked pretty grave to me for a long while. How have they the courage to keep on doing it? It depresses me now to buy wedding presents.\u201d For some time the doctor watched his guest, who was sunk in bitter reflections. \u201cSuch things used to go better than they do now, I believe. Seems to me all the married people I knew when I was a boy were happy enough.\u201d He paused again and bit the end off a fresh cigar. \u201cYou never saw Thea's mother, did you, Ottenburg? That's a pity. Mrs. Kronborg was a fine woman. I've always been afraid Thea made a mistake, not coming home when Mrs. Kronborg was ill, no matter what it cost her.\u201d", "40": "Ottenburg moved about restlessly. \u201cShe couldn't, Archie, she positively couldn't. I felt you never understood that, but I was in Dresden at the time, and though I wasn't seeing much of her, I could size up the situation for myself. It was by just a lucky chance that she got to sing ELIZABETH that time at the Dresden Opera, a complication of circumstances. If she'd run away, for any reason, she might have waited years for such a chance to come again. She gave a wonderful performance and made a great impression. They offered her certain terms; she had to take them and follow it up then and there. In that game you can't lose a single trick. She was ill herself, but she sang. Her mother was ill, and she sang. No, you mustn't hold that against her, Archie. She did the right thing there.\u201d Ottenburg drew out his watch. \u201cHello! I must be traveling. You hear from her regularly?\u201d", "41": "\u201cMore or less regularly. She was never much of a letter-writer. She tells me about her engagements and contracts, but I know so little about that business that it doesn't mean much to me beyond the figures, which seem very impressive. We've had a good deal of business correspondence, about putting up a stone to her father and mother, and, lately, about her youngest brother, Thor. He is with me now; he drives my car. To-day he's up at the mine.\u201d", "42": "Ottenburg, who had picked up his overcoat, dropped it. \u201cDrives your car?\u201d he asked incredulously.", "43": "\u201cYes. Thea and I have had a good deal of bother about Thor. We tried a business college, and an engineering school, but it was no good. Thor was born a chauffeur before there were cars to drive. He was never good for anything else; lay around home and collected postage stamps and took bicycles to pieces, waiting for the automobile to be invented. He's just as much a part of a car as the steering-gear. I can't find out whether he likes his job with me or not, or whether he feels any curiosity about his sister. You can't find anything out from a Kronborg nowadays. The mother was different.\u201d", "44": "Fred plunged into his coat. \u201cWell, it's a queer world, Archie. But you'll think better of it, if you go to New York. Wish I were going with you. I'll drop in on you in the morning at about eleven. I want a word with you about this Interstate Commerce Bill. Good-night.\u201d", "45": "Dr. Archie saw his guest to the motor which was waiting below, and then went back to his library, where he replenished the fire and sat down for a long smoke. A man of Archie's modest and rather credulous nature develops late, and makes his largest gain between forty and fifty. At thirty, indeed, as we have seen, Archie was a soft-hearted boy under a manly exterior, still whistling to keep up his courage. Prosperity and large responsibilities\u2014above all, getting free of poor Mrs. Archie\u2014had brought out a good deal more than he knew was in him. He was thinking tonight as he sat before the fire, in the comfort he liked so well, that but for lucky chances, and lucky holes in the ground, he would still be a country practitioner, reading his old books by his office lamp. And yet, he was not so fresh and energetic as he ought to be. He was tired of business and of politics. Worse than that, he was tired of the men with whom he had to do and of the women who, as he said, had been kind to him. He felt as if he were still hunting for something, like old Jasper Flight. He knew that this was an unbecoming and ungrateful state of mind, and he reproached himself for it. But he could not help wondering why it was that life, even when it gave so much, after all gave so little. What was it that he had expected and missed? Why was he, more than he was anything else, disappointed?", "46": "He fell to looking back over his life and asking himself which years of it he would like to live over again,\u2014just as they had been,\u2014and they were not many. His college years he would live again, gladly. After them there was nothing he would care to repeat until he came to Thea Kronborg. There had been something stirring about those years in Moonstone, when he was a restless young man on the verge of breaking into larger enterprises, and when she was a restless child on the verge of growing up into something unknown. He realized now that she had counted for a great deal more to him than he knew at the time. It was a continuous sort of relationship. He was always on the lookout for her as he went about the town, always vaguely expecting her as he sat in his office at night. He had never asked himself then if it was strange that he should find a child of twelve the most interesting and companionable person in Moonstone. It had seemed a pleasant, natural kind of solicitude. He explained it then by the fact that he had no children of his own. But now, as he looked back at those years, the other interests were faded and inanimate. The thought of them was heavy. But wherever his life had touched Thea Kronborg's, there was still a little warmth left, a little sparkle. Their friendship seemed to run over those discontented years like a leafy pattern, still bright and fresh when the other patterns had faded into the dull background. Their walks and drives and confidences, the night they watched the rabbit in the moonlight,\u2014why were these things stirring to remember? Whenever he thought of them, they were distinctly different from the other memories of his life; always seemed humorous, gay, with a little thrill of anticipation and mystery about them. They came nearer to being tender secrets than any others he possessed. Nearer than anything else they corresponded to what he had hoped to find in the world, and had not found. It came over him now that the unexpected favors of fortune, no matter how dazzling, do not mean very much to us. They may excite or divert us for a time, but when we look back, the only things we cherish are those which in some way met our original want; the desire which formed in us in early youth, undirected, and of its own accord."}, "III": {"0": "FOR the first four years after Thea went to Germany things went on as usual with the Kronborg family. Mrs. Kronborg's land in Nebraska increased in value and brought her in a good rental. The family drifted into an easier way of living, half without realizing it, as families will. Then Mr. Kronborg, who had never been ill, died suddenly of cancer of the liver, and after his death Mrs. Kronborg went, as her neighbors said, into a decline. Hearing discouraging reports of her from the physician who had taken over his practice, Dr. Archie went up from Denver to see her. He found her in bed, in the room where he had more than once attended her, a handsome woman of sixty with a body still firm and white, her hair, faded now to a very pale primrose, in two thick braids down her back, her eyes clear and calm. When the doctor arrived, she was sitting up in her bed, knitting. He felt at once how glad she was to see him, but he soon gathered that she had made no determination to get well. She told him, indeed, that she could not very well get along without Mr. Kronborg. The doctor looked at her with astonishment. Was it possible that she could miss the foolish old man so much? He reminded her of her children.", "1": "\u201cYes,\u201d she replied; \u201cthe children are all very well, but they are not father. We were married young.\u201d", "2": "The doctor watched her wonderingly as she went on knitting, thinking how much she looked like Thea. The difference was one of degree rather than of kind. The daughter had a compelling enthusiasm, the mother had none. But their framework, their foundation, was very much the same.", "3": "In a moment Mrs. Kronborg spoke again. \u201cHave you heard anything from Thea lately?\u201d", "4": "During his talk with her, the doctor gathered that what Mrs. Kronborg really wanted was to see her daughter Thea. Lying there day after day, she wanted it calmly and continuously. He told her that, since she felt so, he thought they might ask Thea to come home.", "5": "\u201cI've thought a good deal about it,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg slowly. \u201cI hate to interrupt her, now that she's begun to get advancement. I expect she's seen some pretty hard times, though she was never one to complain. Perhaps she'd feel that she would like to come. It would be hard, losing both of us while she's off there.\u201d", "6": "When Dr. Archie got back to Denver he wrote a long letter to Thea, explaining her mother's condition and how much she wished to see her, and asking Thea to come, if only for a few weeks. Thea had repaid the money she had borrowed from him, and he assured her that if she happened to be short of funds for the journey, she had only to cable him.", "7": "A month later he got a frantic sort of reply from Thea. Complications in the opera at Dresden had given her an unhoped-for opportunity to go on in a big part. Before this letter reached the doctor, she would have made her debut as ELIZABETH, in \u201cTannhauser.\u201d She wanted to go to her mother more than she wanted anything else in the world, but, unless she failed,\u2014which she would not,\u2014she absolutely could not leave Dresden for six months. It was not that she chose to stay; she had to stay\u2014or lose everything. The next few months would put her five years ahead, or would put her back so far that it would be of no use to struggle further. As soon as she was free, she would go to Moonstone and take her mother back to Germany with her. Her mother, she was sure, could live for years yet, and she would like German people and German ways, and could be hearing music all the time. Thea said she was writing her mother and begging her to help her one last time; to get strength and to wait for her six months, and then she (Thea) would do everything. Her mother would never have to make an effort again.", "8": "Dr. Archie went up to Moonstone at once. He had great confidence in Mrs. Kronborg's power of will, and if Thea's appeal took hold of her enough, he believed she might get better. But when he was shown into the familiar room off the parlor, his heart sank. Mrs. Kronborg was lying serene and fateful on her pillows. On the dresser at the foot of her bed there was a large photograph of Thea in the character in which she was to make her debut. Mrs. Kronborg pointed to it.", "9": "\u201cIsn't she lovely, doctor? It's nice that she hasn't changed much. I've seen her look like that many a time.\u201d", "10": "They talked for a while about Thea's good fortune. Mrs. Kronborg had had a cablegram saying, \u201cFirst performance well received. Great relief.\u201d In her letter Thea said; \u201cIf you'll only get better, dear mother, there's nothing I can't do. I will make a really great success, if you'll try with me. You shall have everything you want, and we will always be together. I have a little house all picked out where we are to live.\u201d", "11": "\u201cBringing up a family is not all it's cracked up to be,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg with a flicker of irony, as she tucked the letter back under her pillow. \u201cThe children you don't especially need, you have always with you, like the poor. But the bright ones get away from you. They have their own way to make in the world. Seems like the brighter they are, the farther they go. I used to feel sorry that you had no family, doctor, but maybe you're as well off.\u201d", "12": "\u201cThea's plan seems sound to me, Mrs. Kronborg. There's no reason I can see why you shouldn't pull up and live for years yet, under proper care. You'd have the best doctors in the world over there, and it would be wonderful to live with anybody who looks like that.\u201d He nodded at the photograph of the young woman who must have been singing \u201cDICH, THEURE HALLE, GRUSS' ICH WIEDER,\u201d her eyes looking up, her beautiful hands outspread with pleasure.", "13": "Mrs. Kronborg laughed quite cheerfully. \u201cYes, wouldn't it? If father were here, I might rouse myself. But sometimes it's hard to come back. Or if she were in trouble, maybe I could rouse myself.\u201d", "14": "\u201cBut, dear Mrs. Kronborg, she is in trouble,\u201d her old friend expostulated. \u201cAs she says, she's never needed you as she needs you now. I make my guess that she's never begged anybody to help her before.\u201d", "15": "Mrs. Kronborg smiled. \u201cYes, it's pretty of her. But that will pass. When these things happen far away they don't make such a mark; especially if your hands are full and you've duties of your own to think about. My own father died in Nebraska when Gunner was born,\u2014we were living in Iowa then,\u2014and I was sorry, but the baby made it up to me. I was father's favorite, too. That's the way it goes, you see.\u201d", "16": "The doctor took out Thea's letter to him, and read it over to Mrs. Kronborg. She seemed to listen, and not to listen.", "17": "When he finished, she said thoughtfully: \u201cI'd counted on hearing her sing again. But I always took my pleasures as they come. I always enjoyed her singing when she was here about the house. While she was practicing I often used to leave my work and sit down in a rocker and give myself up to it, the same as if I'd been at an entertainment. I was never one of these housekeepers that let their work drive them to death. And when she had the Mexicans over here, I always took it in. First and last,\u201d\u2014she glanced judicially at the photograph,\u2014\u201cI guess I got about as much out of Thea's voice as anybody will ever get.\u201d", "18": "\u201cI guess you did!\u201d the doctor assented heartily; \u201cand I got a good deal myself. You remember how she used to sing those Scotch songs for me, and lead us with her head, her hair bobbing?\u201d", "19": "\u201c'Flow Gently, Sweet Afton,'\u2014I can hear it now,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg; \u201cand poor father never knew when he sang sharp! He used to say, 'Mother, how do you always know when they make mistakes practicing?'\u201d Mrs. Kronborg chuckled.", "20": "Dr. Archie took her hand, still firm like the hand of a young woman. \u201cIt was lucky for her that you did know. I always thought she got more from you than from any of her teachers.\u201d", "21": "\u201cExcept Wunsch; he was a real musician,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg respectfully. \u201cI gave her what chance I could, in a crowded house. I kept the other children out of the parlor for her. That was about all I could do. If she wasn't disturbed, she needed no watching. She went after it like a terrier after rats from the first, poor child. She was downright afraid of it. That's why I always encouraged her taking Thor off to outlandish places. When she was out of the house, then she was rid of it.\u201d", "22": "After they had recalled many pleasant memories together, Mrs. Kronborg said suddenly: \u201cI always understood about her going off without coming to see us that time. Oh, I know! You had to keep your own counsel. You were a good friend to her. I've never forgot that.\u201d She patted the doctor's sleeve and went on absently. \u201cThere was something she didn't want to tell me, and that's why she didn't come. Something happened when she was with those people in Mexico. I worried for a good while, but I guess she's come out of it all right. She'd had a pretty hard time, scratching along alone like that when she was so young, and my farms in Nebraska were down so low that I couldn't help her none. That's no way to send a girl out. But I guess, whatever there was, she wouldn't be afraid to tell me now.\u201d Mrs. Kronborg looked up at the photograph with a smile. \u201cShe doesn't look like she was beholding to anybody, does she?\u201d", "23": "\u201cShe isn't, Mrs. Kronborg. She never has been. That was why she borrowed the money from me.\u201d", "24": "\u201cOh, I knew she'd never have sent for you if she'd done anything to shame us. She was always proud.\u201d Mrs. Kronborg paused and turned a little on her side. \u201cIt's been quite a satisfaction to you and me, doctor, having her voice turn out so fine. The things you hope for don't always turn out like that, by a long sight. As long as old Mrs. Kohler lived, she used always to translate what it said about Thea in the German papers she sent. I could make some of it out myself,\u2014it's not very different from Swedish,\u2014but it pleased the old lady. She left Thea her piece-picture of the burning of Moscow. I've got it put away in moth-balls for her, along with the oboe her grandfather brought from Sweden. I want her to take father's oboe back there some day.\u201d Mrs. Kronborg paused a moment and compressed her lips. \u201cBut I guess she'll take a finer instrument than that with her, back to Sweden!\u201d she added.", "25": "Her tone fairly startled the doctor, it was so vibrating with a fierce, defiant kind of pride he had heard often in Thea's voice. He looked down wonderingly at his old friend and patient. After all, one never knew people to the core. Did she, within her, hide some of that still passion of which her daughter was all-compact?", "26": "\u201cThat last summer at home wasn't very nice for her,\u201d Mrs. Kronborg began as placidly as if the fire had never leaped up in her. \u201cThe other children were acting-up because they thought I might make a fuss over her and give her the big-head. We gave her the dare, somehow, the lot of us, because we couldn't understand her changing teachers and all that. That's the trouble about giving the dare to them quiet, unboastful children; you never know how far it'll take 'em. Well, we ought not to complain, doctor; she's given us a good deal to think about.\u201d", "27": "The next time Dr. Archie came to Moonstone, he came to be a pall-bearer at Mrs. Kronborg's funeral. When he last looked at her, she was so serene and queenly that he went back to Denver feeling almost as if he had helped to bury Thea Kronborg herself. The handsome head in the coffin seemed to him much more really Thea than did the radiant young woman in the picture, looking about at the Gothic vaultings and greeting the Hall of Song."}, "IV": {"0": "ONE bright morning late in February Dr. Archie was breakfasting comfortably at the Waldorf. He had got into Jersey City on an early train, and a red, windy sunrise over the North River had given him a good appetite. He consulted the morning paper while he drank his coffee and saw that \u201cLohengrin\u201d was to be sung at the opera that evening. In the list of the artists who would appear was the name \u201cKronborg.\u201d Such abruptness rather startled him. \u201cKronborg\u201d: it was impressive and yet, somehow, disrespectful; somewhat rude and brazen, on the back page of the morning paper. After breakfast he went to the hotel ticket office and asked the girl if she could give him something for \u201cLohengrin,\u201d \u201cnear the front.\u201d His manner was a trifle awkward and he wondered whether the girl noticed it. Even if she did, of course, she could scarcely suspect. Before the ticket stand he saw a bunch of blue posters announcing the opera casts for the week. There was \u201cLohengrin,\u201d and under it he saw:\u2014", "1": "ELSA VON BRABANT...Thea Kronborg.", "2": "That looked better. The girl gave him a ticket for a seat which she said was excellent. He paid for it and went out to the cabstand. He mentioned to the driver a number on Riverside Drive and got into a taxi. It would not, of course, be the right thing to call upon Thea when she was going to sing in the evening. He knew that much, thank goodness! Fred Ottenburg had hinted to him that, more than almost anything else, that would put one in wrong.", "3": "When he reached the number to which he directed his letters, he dismissed the cab and got out for a walk. The house in which Thea lived was as impersonal as the Waldorf, and quite as large. It was above 116th Street, where the Drive narrows, and in front of it the shelving bank dropped to the North River. As Archie strolled about the paths which traversed this slope, below the street level, the fourteen stories of the apartment hotel rose above him like a perpendicular cliff. He had no idea on which floor Thea lived, but he reflected, as his eye ran over the many windows, that the outlook would be fine from any floor. The forbidding hugeness of the house made him feel as if he had expected to meet Thea in a crowd and had missed her. He did not really believe that she was hidden away behind any of those glittering windows, or that he was to hear her this evening. His walk was curiously uninspiring and unsuggestive. Presently remembering that Ottenburg had encouraged him to study his lesson, he went down to the opera house and bought a libretto. He had even brought his old \u201cAdler's German and English\u201d in his trunk, and after luncheon he settled down in his gilded suite at the Waldorf with a big cigar and the text of \u201cLohengrin.\u201d", "4": "The opera was announced for seven-forty-five, but at half-past seven Archie took his seat in the right front of the orchestra circle. He had never been inside the Metropolitan Opera House before, and the height of the audience room, the rich color, and the sweep of the balconies were not without their effect upon him. He watched the house fill with a growing feeling of expectation. When the steel curtain rose and the men of the orchestra took their places, he felt distinctly nervous. The burst of applause which greeted the conductor keyed him still higher. He found that he had taken off his gloves and twisted them to a string. When the lights went down and the violins began the overture, the place looked larger than ever; a great pit, shadowy and solemn. The whole atmosphere, he reflected, was somehow more serious than he had anticipated.", "5": "After the curtains were drawn back upon the scene beside the Scheldt, he got readily into the swing of the story. He was so much interested in the bass who sang KING HENRY that he had almost forgotten for what he was waiting so nervously, when the HERALD began in stentorian tones to summon ELSA VON BRABANT. Then he began to realize that he was rather frightened. There was a flutter of white at the back of the stage, and women began to come in: two, four, six, eight, but not the right one. It flashed across him that this was something like buck-fever, the paralyzing moment that comes upon a man when his first elk looks at him through the bushes, under its great antlers; the moment when a man's mind is so full of shooting that he forgets the gun in his hand until the buck nods adieu to him from a distant hill.", "6": "All at once, before the buck had left him, she was there. Yes, unquestionably it was she. Her eyes were downcast, but the head, the cheeks, the chin\u2014there could be no mistake; she advanced slowly, as if she were walking in her sleep. Some one spoke to her; she only inclined her head. He spoke again, and she bowed her head still lower. Archie had forgotten his libretto, and he had not counted upon these long pauses. He had expected her to appear and sing and reassure him. They seemed to be waiting for her. Did she ever forget? Why in thunder didn't she\u2014She made a sound, a faint one. The people on the stage whispered together and seemed confounded. His nervousness was absurd. She must have done this often before; she knew her bearings. She made another sound, but he could make nothing of it. Then the King sang to her, and Archie began to remember where they were in the story. She came to the front of the stage, lifted her eyes for the first time, clasped her hands and began, \u201cEINSAM IN TRUBEN TAGEN.\u201d", "7": "Yes, it was exactly like buck-fever. Her face was there, toward the house now, before his eyes, and he positively could not see it. She was singing, at last, and he positively could not hear her. He was conscious of nothing but an uncomfortable dread and a sense of crushing disappointment. He had, after all, missed her. Whatever was there, she was not there\u2014for him.", "8": "The King interrupted her. She began again, \u201cIN LICHTER WAFFEN SCHEINE.\u201d Archie did not know when his buckfever passed, but presently he found that he was sitting quietly in a darkened house, not listening to but dreaming upon a river of silver sound. He felt apart from the others, drifting alone on the melody, as if he had been alone with it for a long while and had known it all before. His power of attention was not great just then, but in so far as it went he seemed to be looking through an exalted calmness at a beautiful woman from far away, from another sort of life and feeling and understanding than his own, who had in her face something he had known long ago, much brightened and beautified. As a lad he used to believe that the faces of people who died were like that in the next world; the same faces, but shining with the light of a new understanding. No, Ottenburg had not prepared him!", "9": "What he felt was admiration and estrangement. The homely reunion, that he had somehow expected, now seemed foolish. Instead of feeling proud that he knew her better than all these people about him, he felt chagrined at his own ingenuousness. For he did not know her better. This woman he had never known; she had somehow devoured his little friend, as the wolf ate up Red Ridinghood. Beautiful, radiant, tender as she was, she chilled his old affection; that sort of feeling was not appropriate. She seemed much, much farther away from him than she had seemed all those years when she was in Germany. The ocean he could cross, but there was something here he could not cross. There was a moment, when she turned to the King and smiled that rare, sunrise smile of her childhood, when he thought she was coming back to him. After the HERALD'S second call for her champion, when she knelt in her impassioned prayer, there was again something familiar, a kind of wild wonder that she had had the power to call up long ago. But she merely reminded him of Thea; this was not the girl herself.", "10": "After the tenor came on, the doctor ceased trying to make the woman before him fit into any of his cherished recollections. He took her, in so far as he could, for what she was then and there. When the knight raised the kneeling girl and put his mailed hand on her hair, when she lifted to him a face full of worship and passionate humility, Archie gave up his last reservation. He knew no more about her than did the hundreds around him, who sat in the shadow and looked on, as he looked, some with more understanding, some with less. He knew as much about ORTRUDE or LOHENGRIN as he knew about ELSA\u2014more, because she went further than they, she sustained the legendary beauty of her conception more consistently. Even he could see that. Attitudes, movements, her face, her white arms and fingers, everything was suffused with a rosy tenderness, a warm humility, a gracious and yet\u2014to him\u2014wholly estranging beauty.", "11": "During the balcony singing in the second act the doctor's thoughts were as far away from Moonstone as the singer's doubtless were. He had begun, indeed, to feel the exhilaration of getting free from personalities, of being released from his own past as well as from Thea Kronborg's. It was very much, he told himself, like a military funeral, exalting and impersonal. Something old died in one, and out of it something new was born. During the duet with ORTRUDE, and the splendors of the wedding processional, this new feeling grew and grew. At the end of the act there were many curtain calls and ELSA acknowledged them, brilliant, gracious, spirited, with her far-breaking smile; but on the whole she was harder and more self-contained before the curtain than she was in the scene behind it. Archie did his part in the applause that greeted her, but it was the new and wonderful he applauded, not the old and dear. His personal, proprietary pride in her was frozen out.", "12": "He walked about the house during the ENTR'ACTE, and here and there among the people in the foyer he caught the name \u201cKronborg.\u201d On the staircase, in front of the coffeeroom, a long-haired youth with a fat face was discoursing to a group of old women about \u201cdie Kronborg.\u201d Dr. Archie gathered that he had crossed on the boat with her.", "13": "After the performance was over, Archie took a taxi and started for Riverside Drive. He meant to see it through to-night. When he entered the reception hall of the hotel before which he had strolled that morning, the hall porter challenged him. He said he was waiting for Miss Kronborg. The porter looked at him suspiciously and asked whether he had an appointment. He answered brazenly that he had. He was not used to being questioned by hall boys. Archie sat first in one tapestry chair and then in another, keeping a sharp eye on the people who came in and went up in the elevators. He walked about and looked at his watch. An hour dragged by. No one had come in from the street now for about twenty minutes, when two women entered, carrying a great many flowers and followed by a tall young man in chauffeur's uniform. Archie advanced toward the taller of the two women, who was veiled and carried her head very firmly. He confronted her just as she reached the elevator. Although he did not stand directly in her way, something in his attitude compelled her to stop. She gave him a piercing, defiant glance through the white scarf that covered her face. Then she lifted her hand and brushed the scarf back from her head. There was still black on her brows and lashes. She was very pale and her face was drawn and deeply lined. She looked, the doctor told himself with a sinking heart, forty years old. Her suspicious, mystified stare cleared slowly.", "14": "\u201cPardon me,\u201d the doctor murmured, not knowing just how to address her here before the porters, \u201cI came up from the opera. I merely wanted to say good-night to you.\u201d", "15": "Without speaking, still looking incredulous, she pushed him into the elevator. She kept her hand on his arm while the cage shot up, and she looked away from him, frowning, as if she were trying to remember or realize something. When the cage stopped, she pushed him out of the elevator through another door, which a maid opened, into a square hall. There she sank down on a chair and looked up at him.", "16": "\u201cWhy didn't you let me know?\u201d she asked in a hoarse voice.", "17": "Archie heard himself laughing the old, embarrassed laugh that seldom happened to him now. \u201cOh, I wanted to take my chance with you, like anybody else. It's been so long, now!\u201d", "18": "She took his hand through her thick glove and her head dropped forward. \u201cYes, it has been long,\u201d she said in the same husky voice, \u201cand so much has happened.\u201d", "19": "\u201cAnd you are so tired, and I am a clumsy old fellow to break in on you to-night,\u201d the doctor added sympathetically. \u201cForgive me, this time.\u201d He bent over and put his hand soothingly on her shoulder. He felt a strong shudder run through her from head to foot.", "20": "Still bundled in her fur coat as she was, she threw both arms about him and hugged him. \u201cOh, Dr. Archie, DR. ARCHIE,\u201d\u2014she shook him,\u2014\u201cdon't let me go. Hold on, now you're here,\u201d she laughed, breaking away from him at the same moment and sliding out of her fur coat. She left it for the maid to pick up and pushed the doctor into the sitting-room, where she turned on the lights. \u201cLet me LOOK at you. Yes; hands, feet, head, shoulders\u2014just the same. You've grown no older. You can't say as much for me, can you?\u201d", "21": "She was standing in the middle of the room, in a white silk shirtwaist and a short black velvet skirt, which somehow suggested that they had 'cut off her petticoats all round about.' She looked distinctly clipped and plucked. Her hair was parted in the middle and done very close to her head, as she had worn it under the wig. She looked like a fugitive, who had escaped from something in clothes caught up at hazard. It flashed across Dr. Archie that she was running away from the other woman down at the opera house, who had used her hardly.", "22": "He took a step toward her. \u201cI can't tell a thing in the world about you, Thea\u2014if I may still call you that.\u201d", "23": "She took hold of the collar of his overcoat. \u201cYes, call me that. Do: I like to hear it. You frighten me a little, but I expect I frighten you more. I'm always a scarecrow after I sing a long part like that\u2014so high, too.\u201d She absently pulled out the handkerchief that protruded from his breast pocket and began to wipe the black paint off her eyebrows and lashes. \u201cI can't take you in much to-night, but I must see you for a little while.\u201d She pushed him to a chair. \u201cI shall be more recognizable to-morrow. You mustn't think of me as you see me to-night. Come at four to-morrow afternoon and have tea with me. Can you? That's good.\u201d", "24": "She sat down in a low chair beside him and leaned forward, drawing her shoulders together. She seemed to him inappropriately young and inappropriately old, shorn of her long tresses at one end and of her long robes at the other.", "25": "\u201cHow do you happen to be here?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cHow can you leave a silver mine? I couldn't! Sure nobody'll cheat you? But you can explain everything tomorrow.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou remember how you sewed me up in a poultice, once? I wish you could to-night. I need a poultice, from top to toe. Something very disagreeable happened down there. You said you were out front? Oh, don't say anything about it. I always know exactly how it goes, unfortunately. I was rotten in the balcony. I never get that. You didn't notice it? Probably not, but I did.\u201d", "26": "Here the maid appeared at the door and her mistress rose. \u201cMy supper? Very well, I'll come. I'd ask you to stay, doctor, but there wouldn't be enough for two. They seldom send up enough for one,\u201d\u2014she spoke bitterly. \u201cI haven't got a sense of you yet,\u201d\u2014turning directly to Archie again. \u201cYou haven't been here. You've only announced yourself, and told me you are coming to-morrow. You haven't seen me, either. This is not I. But I'll be here waiting for you to-morrow, my whole works! Goodnight, till then.\u201d She patted him absently on the sleeve and gave him a little shove toward the door."}, "V": {"0": "WHEN Archie got back to his hotel at two o'clock in the morning, he found Fred Ottenburg's card under his door, with a message scribbled across the top: \u201cWhen you come in, please call up room 811, this hotel.\u201d A moment later Fred's voice reached him over the telephone.", "1": "\u201cThat you, Archie? Won't you come up? I'm having some supper and I'd like company. Late? What does that matter? I won't keep you long.\u201d", "2": "Archie dropped his overcoat and set out for room 811. He found Ottenburg in the act of touching a match to a chafing-dish, at a table laid for two in his sitting-room. \u201cI'm catering here,\u201d he announced cheerfully. \u201cI let the waiter off at midnight, after he'd set me up. You'll have to account for yourself, Archie.\u201d", "3": "The doctor laughed, pointing to three wine-coolers under the table. \u201cAre you expecting guests?\u201d", "4": "\u201cYes, two.\u201d Ottenburg held up two fingers,\u2014\u201cyou, and my higher self. He's a thirsty boy, and I don't invite him often. He has been known to give me a headache. Now, where have you been, Archie, until this shocking hour?\u201d", "5": "\u201cBah, you've been banting!\u201d the doctor exclaimed, pulling out his white gloves as he searched for his handkerchief and throwing them into a chair. Ottenburg was in evening clothes and very pointed dress shoes. His white waistcoat, upon which the doctor had fixed a challenging eye, went down straight from the top button, and he wore a camelia. He was conspicuously brushed and trimmed and polished. His smoothly controlled excitement was wholly different from his usual easy cordiality, though he had his face, as well as his figure, well in hand. On the serving-table there was an empty champagne pint and a glass. He had been having a little starter, the doctor told himself, and would probably be running on high gear before he got through. There was even now an air of speed about him.", "6": "\u201cBeen, Freddy?\u201d\u2014the doctor at last took up his question. \u201cI expect I've been exactly where you have. Why didn't you tell me you were coming on?\u201d", "7": "\u201cI wasn't, Archie.\u201d Fred lifted the cover of the chafingdish and stirred the contents. He stood behind the table, holding the lid with his handkerchief. \u201cI had never thought of such a thing. But Landry, a young chap who plays her accompaniments and who keeps an eye out for me, telegraphed me that Madame Rheinecker had gone to Atlantic City with a bad throat, and Thea might have a chance to sing ELSA. She has sung it only twice here before, and I missed it in Dresden. So I came on. I got in at four this afternoon and saw you registered, but I thought I wouldn't butt in. How lucky you got here just when she was coming on for this. You couldn't have hit a better time.\u201d Ottenburg stirred the contents of the dish faster and put in more sherry. \u201cAnd where have you been since twelve o'clock, may I ask?\u201d", "8": "Archie looked rather self-conscious, as he sat down on a fragile gilt chair that rocked under him, and stretched out his long legs. \u201cWell, if you'll believe me, I had the brutality to go to see her. I wanted to identify her. Couldn't wait.\u201d", "9": "Ottenburg placed the cover quickly on the chafing-dish and took a step backward. \u201cYou did, old sport? My word! None but the brave deserve the fair. Well,\u201d\u2014he stooped to turn the wine,\u2014\u201cand how was she?\u201d", "10": "\u201cShe seemed rather dazed, and pretty well used up. She seemed disappointed in herself, and said she hadn't done herself justice in the balcony scene.\u201d", "11": "\u201cWell, if she didn't, she's not the first. Beastly stuff to sing right in there; lies just on the 'break' in the voice.\u201d Fred pulled a bottle out of the ice and drew the cork. Lifting his glass he looked meaningly at Archie. \u201cYou know who, doctor. Here goes!\u201d He drank off his glass with a sigh of satisfaction. After he had turned the lamp low under the chafing-dish, he remained standing, looking pensively down at the food on the table. \u201cWell, she rather pulled it off! As a backer, you're a winner, Archie. I congratulate you.\u201d Fred poured himself another glass. \u201cNow you must eat something, and so must I. Here, get off that bird cage and find a steady chair. This stuff ought to be rather good; head waiter's suggestion. Smells all right.\u201d He bent over the chafing-dish and began to serve the contents. \u201cPerfectly innocuous: mushrooms and truffles and a little crab-meat. And now, on the level, Archie, how did it hit you?\u201d", "12": "Archie turned a frank smile to his friend and shook his head. \u201cIt was all miles beyond me, of course, but it gave me a pulse. The general excitement got hold of me, I suppose. I like your wine, Freddy.\u201d He put down his glass. \u201cIt goes to the spot to-night. She WAS all right, then? You weren't disappointed?\u201d", "13": "\u201cDisappointed? My dear Archie, that's the high voice we dream of; so pure and yet so virile and human. That combination hardly ever happens with sopranos.\u201d Ottenburg sat down and turned to the doctor, speaking calmly and trying to dispel his friend's manifest bewilderment. \u201cYou see, Archie, there's the voice itself, so beautiful and individual, and then there's something else; the thing in it which responds to every shade of thought and feeling, spontaneously, almost unconsciously. That color has to be born in a singer, it can't be acquired; lots of beautiful voices haven't a vestige of it. It's almost like another gift\u2014the rarest of all. The voice simply is the mind and is the heart. It can't go wrong in interpretation, because it has in it the thing that makes all interpretation. That's why you feel so sure of her. After you've listened to her for an hour or so, you aren't afraid of anything. All the little dreads you have with other artists vanish. You lean back and you say to yourself, 'No, THAT voice will never betray.' TREULICH GEFUHRT, TREULICH BEWACHT.\u201d", "14": "Archie looked envyingly at Fred's excited, triumphant face. How satisfactory it must be, he thought, to really know what she was doing and not to have to take it on hearsay. He took up his glass with a sigh. \u201cI seem to need a good deal of cooling off to-night. I'd just as lief forget the Reform Party for once.", "15": "\u201cYes, Fred,\u201d he went on seriously; \u201cI thought it sounded very beautiful, and I thought she was very beautiful, too. I never imagined she could be as beautiful as that.\u201d", "16": "\u201cWasn't she? Every attitude a picture, and always the right kind of picture, full of that legendary, supernatural thing she gets into it. I never heard the prayer sung like that before. That look that came in her eyes; it went right out through the back of the roof. Of course, you get an ELSA who can look through walls like that, and visions and Grail-knights happen naturally. She becomes an abbess, that girl, after LOHENGRIN leaves her. She's made to live with ideas and enthusiasms, not with a husband.\u201d Fred folded his arms, leaned back in his chair, and began to sing softly:\u2014", "17": "\u201cEin Ritter nahte da.\u201d", "18": "\u201cDoesn't she die, then, at the end?\u201d the doctor asked guardedly.", "19": "Fred smiled, reaching under the table. \u201cSome ELSAS do; she didn't. She left me with the distinct impression that she was just beginning. Now, doctor, here's a cold one.\u201d He twirled a napkin smoothly about the green glass, the cork gave and slipped out with a soft explosion. \u201cAnd now we must have another toast. It's up to you, this time.\u201d", "20": "The doctor watched the agitation in his glass. \u201cThe same,\u201d he said without lifting his eyes. \u201cThat's good enough. I can't raise you.\u201d", "21": "Fred leaned forward, and looked sharply into his face. \u201cThat's the point; how COULD you raise me? Once again!\u201d", "22": "\u201cOnce again, and always the same!\u201d The doctor put down his glass. \u201cThis doesn't seem to produce any symptoms in me to-night.\u201d He lit a cigar. \u201cSeriously, Freddy, I wish I knew more about what she's driving at. It makes me jealous, when you are so in it and I'm not.\u201d", "23": "\u201cIn it?\u201d Fred started up. \u201cMy God, haven't you seen her this blessed night?\u2014when she'd have kicked any other man down the elevator shaft, if I know her. Leave me something; at least what I can pay my five bucks for.\u201d", "24": "\u201cSeems to me you get a good deal for your five bucks,\u201d said Archie ruefully. \u201cAnd that, after all, is what she cares about,\u2014what people get.\u201d", "25": "Fred lit a cigarette, took a puff or two, and then threw it away. He was lounging back in his chair, and his face was pale and drawn hard by that mood of intense concentration which lurks under the sunny shallows of the vineyard. In his voice there was a longer perspective than usual, a slight remoteness. \u201cYou see, Archie, it's all very simple, a natural development. It's exactly what Mahler said back there in the beginning, when she sang WOGLINDE. It's the idea, the basic idea, pulsing behind every bar she sings. She simplifies a character down to the musical idea it's built on, and makes everything conform to that. The people who chatter about her being a great actress don't seem to get the notion of where SHE gets the notion. It all goes back to her original endowment, her tremendous musical talent. Instead of inventing a lot of business and expedients to suggest character, she knows the thing at the root, and lets the musical pattern take care of her. The score pours her into all those lovely postures, makes the light and shadow go over her face, lifts her and drops her. She lies on it, the way she used to lie on the Rhine music. Talk about rhythm!\u201d", "26": "The doctor frowned dubiously as a third bottle made its appearance above the cloth. \u201cAren't you going in rather strong?\u201d", "27": "Fred laughed. \u201cNo, I'm becoming too sober. You see this is breakfast now; kind of wedding breakfast. I feel rather weddingish. I don't mind. You know,\u201d he went on as the wine gurgled out, \u201cI was thinking to-night when they sprung the wedding music, how any fool can have that stuff played over him when he walks up the aisle with some dough-faced little hussy who's hooked him. But it isn't every fellow who can see\u2014well, what we saw tonight. There are compensations in life, Dr. Howard Archie, though they come in disguise. Did you notice her when she came down the stairs? Wonder where she gets that bright-and-morning star look? Carries to the last row of the family circle. I moved about all over the house. I'll tell you a secret, Archie: that carrying power was one of the first things that put me wise. Noticed it down there in Arizona, in the open. That, I said, belongs only to the big ones.\u201d Fred got up and began to move rhythmically about the room, his hands in his pockets. The doctor was astonished at his ease and steadiness, for there were slight lapses in his speech. \u201cYou see, Archie, ELSA isn't a part that's particularly suited to Thea's voice at all, as I see her voice. It's over-lyrical for her. She makes it, but there's nothing in it that fits her like a glove, except, maybe, that long duet in the third act. There, of course,\u201d\u2014he held out his hands as if he were measuring something,\u2014\u201cwe know exactly where we are. But wait until they give her a chance at something that lies properly in her voice, and you'll see me rosier than I am to-night.\u201d", "28": "Archie smoothed the tablecloth with his hand. \u201cI am sure I don't want to see you any rosier, Fred.\u201d", "29": "Ottenburg threw back his head and laughed. \u201cIt's enthusiasm, doctor. It's not the wine. I've got as much inflated as this for a dozen trashy things: brewers' dinners and political orgies. You, too, have your extravagances, Archie. And what I like best in you is this particular enthusiasm, which is not at all practical or sensible, which is downright Quixotic. You are not altogether what you seem, and you have your reservations. Living among the wolves, you have not become one. LUPIBUS VIVENDI NON LUPUS SUM.\u201d", "30": "The doctor seemed embarrassed. \u201cI was just thinking how tired she looked, plucked of all her fine feathers, while we get all the fun. Instead of sitting here carousing, we ought to go solemnly to bed.\u201d", "31": "\u201cI get your idea.\u201d Ottenburg crossed to the window and threw it open. \u201cFine night outside; a hag of a moon just setting. It begins to smell like morning. After all, Archie, think of the lonely and rather solemn hours we've spent waiting for all this, while she's been\u2014reveling.\u201d", "32": "Archie lifted his brows. \u201cI somehow didn't get the idea to-night that she revels much.\u201d", "33": "\u201cI don't mean this sort of thing.\u201d Fred turned toward the light and stood with his back to the window. \u201cThat,\u201d with a nod toward the wine-cooler, \u201cis only a cheap imitation, that any poor stiff-fingered fool can buy and feel his shell grow thinner. But take it from me, no matter what she pays, or how much she may see fit to lie about it, the real, the master revel is hers.\u201d He leaned back against the window sill and crossed his arms. \u201cAnybody with all that voice and all that talent and all that beauty, has her hour. Her hour,\u201d he went on deliberately, \u201cwhen she can say, 'there it is, at last, WIE IM TRAUM ICH. As in my dream I dreamed it, as in my will it was.'\u201d", "34": "He stood silent a moment, twisting the flower from his coat by the stem and staring at the blank wall with haggard abstraction. \u201cEven I can say to-night, Archie,\u201d he brought out slowly, \u201c'As in my dream I dreamed it, as in my will it was.' Now, doctor, you may leave me. I'm beautifully drunk, but not with anything that ever grew in France.\u201d", "35": "The doctor rose. Fred tossed his flower out of the window behind him and came toward the door. \u201cI say,\u201d he called, \u201chave you a date with anybody?\u201d", "36": "The doctor paused, his hand on the knob. \u201cWith Thea, you mean? Yes. I'm to go to her at four this afternoon\u2014if you haven't paralyzed me.\u201d", "37": "\u201cWell, you won't eat me, will you, if I break in and send up my card? She'll probably turn me down cold, but that won't hurt my feelings. If she ducks me, you tell her for me, that to spite me now she'd have to cut off more than she can spare. Good-night, Archie.\u201d"}, "VI": {"0": "IT was late on the morning after the night she sang ELSA, when Thea Kronborg stirred uneasily in her bed. The room was darkened by two sets of window shades, and the day outside was thick and cloudy. She turned and tried to recapture unconsciousness, knowing that she would not be able to do so. She dreaded waking stale and disappointed after a great effort. The first thing that came was always the sense of the futility of such endeavor, and of the absurdity of trying too hard. Up to a certain point, say eighty degrees, artistic endeavor could be fat and comfortable, methodical and prudent. But if you went further than that, if you drew yourself up toward ninety degrees, you parted with your defenses and left yourself exposed to mischance. The legend was that in those upper reaches you might be divine; but you were much likelier to be ridiculous. Your public wanted just about eighty degrees; if you gave it more it blew its nose and put a crimp in you. In the morning, especially, it seemed to her very probable that whatever struggled above the good average was not quite sound. Certainly very little of that superfluous ardor, which cost so dear, ever got across the footlights. These misgivings waited to pounce upon her when she wakened. They hovered about her bed like vultures.", "1": "She reached under her pillow for her handkerchief, without opening her eyes. She had a shadowy memory that there was to be something unusual, that this day held more disquieting possibilities than days commonly held. There was something she dreaded; what was it? Oh, yes, Dr. Archie was to come at four.", "2": "A reality like Dr. Archie, poking up out of the past, reminded one of disappointments and losses, of a freedom that was no more: reminded her of blue, golden mornings long ago, when she used to waken with a burst of joy at recovering her precious self and her precious world; when she never lay on her pillows at eleven o'clock like something the waves had washed up. After all, why had he come? It had been so long, and so much had happened. The things she had lost, he would miss readily enough. What she had gained, he would scarcely perceive. He, and all that he recalled, lived for her as memories. In sleep, and in hours of illness or exhaustion, she went back to them and held them to her heart. But they were better as memories. They had nothing to do with the struggle that made up her actual life. She felt drearily that she was not flexible enough to be the person her old friend expected her to be, the person she herself wished to be with him.", "3": "Thea reached for the bell and rang twice,\u2014a signal to her maid to order her breakfast. She rose and ran up the window shades and turned on the water in her bathroom, glancing into the mirror apprehensively as she passed it. Her bath usually cheered her, even on low mornings like this. Her white bathroom, almost as large as her sleeping-room, she regarded as a refuge. When she turned the key behind her, she left care and vexation on the other side of the door. Neither her maid nor the management nor her letters nor her accompanist could get at her now.", "4": "When she pinned her braids about her head, dropped her nightgown and stepped out to begin her Swedish movements, she was a natural creature again, and it was so that she liked herself best. She slid into the tub with anticipation and splashed and tumbled about a good deal. Whatever else she hurried, she never hurried her bath. She used her brushes and sponges and soaps like toys, fairly playing in the water. Her own body was always a cheering sight to her. When she was careworn, when her mind felt old and tired, the freshness of her physical self, her long, firm lines, the smoothness of her skin, reassured her. This morning, because of awakened memories, she looked at herself more carefully than usual, and was not discouraged. While she was in the tub she began to whistle softly the tenor aria, \u201cAH! FUYEZ, DOUCE IMAGE,\u201d somehow appropriate to the bath. After a noisy moment under the cold shower, she stepped out on the rug flushed and glowing, threw her arms above her head, and rose on her toes, keeping the elevation as long as she could. When she dropped back on her heels and began to rub herself with the towels, she took up the aria again, and felt quite in the humor for seeing Dr. Archie. After she had returned to her bed, the maid brought her letters and the morning papers with her breakfast.", "5": "\u201cTelephone Mr. Landry and ask him if he can come at half-past three, Theresa, and order tea to be brought up at five.\u201d", "6": "When Howard Archie was admitted to Thea's apartment that afternoon, he was shown into the music-room back of the little reception room. Thea was sitting in a davenport behind the piano, talking to a young man whom she later introduced as her friend Mr. Landry. As she rose, and came to meet him, Archie felt a deep relief, a sudden thankfulness. She no longer looked clipped and plucked, or dazed and fleeing.", "7": "Dr. Archie neglected to take account of the young man to whom he was presented. He kept Thea's hands and held her where he met her, taking in the light, lively sweep of her hair, her clear green eyes and her throat that came up strong and dazzlingly white from her green velvet gown. The chin was as lovely as ever, the cheeks as smooth. All the lines of last night had disappeared. Only at the outer corners of her eyes, between the eye and the temple, were the faintest indications of a future attack\u2014mere kitten scratches that playfully hinted where one day the cat would claw her. He studied her without any embarrassment. Last night everything had been awkward; but now, as he held her hands, a kind of harmony came between them, a reestablishment of confidence.", "8": "\u201cAfter all, Thea,\u2014in spite of all, I still know you,\u201d he murmured.", "9": "She took his arm and led him up to the young man who was standing beside the piano. \u201cMr. Landry knows all about you, Dr. Archie. He has known about you for many years.\u201d While the two men shook hands she stood between them, drawing them together by her presence and her glances. \u201cWhen I first went to Germany, Landry was studying there. He used to be good enough to work with me when I could not afford to have an accompanist for more than two hours a day. We got into the way of working together. He is a singer, too, and has his own career to look after, but he still manages to give me some time. I want you to be friends.\u201d She smiled from one to the other.", "10": "The rooms, Archie noticed, full of last night's flowers, were furnished in light colors, the hotel bleakness of them a little softened by a magnificent Steinway piano, white bookshelves full of books and scores, some drawings of ballet dancers, and the very deep sofa behind the piano.", "11": "\u201cOf course,\u201d Archie asked apologetically, \u201cyou have seen the papers?\u201d", "12": "\u201cVery cordial, aren't they? They evidently did not expect as much as I did. ELSA is not really in my voice. I can sing the music, but I have to go after it.\u201d", "13": "\u201cThat is exactly,\u201d the doctor came out boldly, \u201cwhat Fred Ottenburg said this morning.\u201d", "14": "They had remained standing, the three of them, by the piano, where the gray afternoon light was strongest. Thea turned to the doctor with interest. \u201cIs Fred in town? They were from him, then\u2014some flowers that came last night without a card.\u201d She indicated the white lilacs on the window sill. \u201cYes, he would know, certainly,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cWhy don't we sit down? There will be some tea for you in a minute, Landry. He's very dependent upon it,\u201d disapprovingly to Archie. \u201cNow tell me, Doctor, did you really have a good time last night, or were you uncomfortable? Did you feel as if I were trying to hold my hat on by my eyebrows?\u201d", "15": "He smiled. \u201cI had all kinds of a time. But I had no feeling of that sort. I couldn't be quite sure that it was you at all. That was why I came up here last night. I felt as if I'd lost you.\u201d", "16": "She leaned toward him and brushed his sleeve reassuringly. \u201cThen I didn't give you an impression of painful struggle? Landry was singing at Weber and Fields' last night. He didn't get in until the performance was half over. But I see the TRIBUNE man felt that I was working pretty hard. Did you see that notice, Oliver?\u201d", "17": "Dr. Archie looked closely at the red-headed young man for the first time, and met his lively brown eyes, full of a droll, confiding sort of humor. Mr. Landry was not prepossessing. He was undersized and clumsily made, with a red, shiny face and a sharp little nose that looked as if it had been whittled out of wood and was always in the air, on the scent of something. Yet it was this queer little beak, with his eyes, that made his countenance anything of a face at all. From a distance he looked like the groceryman's delivery boy in a small town. His dress seemed an acknowledgment of his grotesqueness: a short coat, like a little boys' roundabout, and a vest fantastically sprigged and dotted, over a lavender shirt.", "18": "At the sound of a muffled buzz, Mr. Landry sprang up.", "19": "\u201cMay I answer the telephone for you?\u201d He went to the writing-table and took up the receiver. \u201cMr. Ottenburg is downstairs,\u201d he said, turning to Thea and holding the mouthpiece against his coat.", "20": "\u201cTell him to come up,\u201d she replied without hesitation. \u201cHow long are you going to be in town, Dr. Archie?\u201d", "21": "\u201cOh, several weeks, if you'll let me stay. I won't hang around and be a burden to you, but I want to try to get educated up to you, though I expect it's late to begin.\u201d", "22": "Thea rose and touched him lightly on the shoulder. \u201cWell, you'll never be any younger, will you?\u201d", "23": "\u201cI'm not so sure about that,\u201d the doctor replied gallantly.", "24": "The maid appeared at the door and announced Mr. Frederick Ottenburg. Fred came in, very much got up, the doctor reflected, as he watched him bending over Thea's hand. He was still pale and looked somewhat chastened, and the lock of hair that hung down over his forehead was distinctly moist. But his black afternoon coat, his gray tie and gaiters were of a correctness that Dr. Archie could never attain for all the efforts of his faithful slave, Van Deusen, the Denver haberdasher. To be properly up to those tricks, the doctor supposed, you had to learn them young. If he were to buy a silk hat that was the twin of Ottenburg's, it would be shaggy in a week, and he could never carry it as Fred held his.", "25": "Ottenburg had greeted Thea in German, and as she replied in the same language, Archie joined Mr. Landry at the window. \u201cYou know Mr. Ottenburg, he tells me?\u201d", "26": "Mr. Landry's eyes twinkled. \u201cYes, I regularly follow him about, when he's in town. I would, even if he didn't send me such wonderful Christmas presents: Russian vodka by the half-dozen!\u201d", "27": "Thea called to them, \u201cCome, Mr. Ottenburg is calling on all of us. Here's the tea.\u201d", "28": "The maid opened the door and two waiters from downstairs appeared with covered trays. The tea-table was in the parlor. Thea drew Ottenburg with her and went to inspect it. \u201cWhere's the rum? Oh, yes, in that thing! Everything seems to be here, but send up some currant preserves and cream cheese for Mr. Ottenburg. And in about fifteen minutes, bring some fresh toast. That's all, thank you.\u201d", "29": "For the next few minutes there was a clatter of teacups and responses about sugar. \u201cLandry always takes rum. I'm glad the rest of you don't. I'm sure it's bad.\u201d Thea poured the tea standing and got through with it as quickly as possible, as if it were a refreshment snatched between trains. The tea-table and the little room in which it stood seemed to be out of scale with her long step, her long reach, and the energy of her movements. Dr. Archie, standing near her, was pleasantly aware of the animation of her figure. Under the clinging velvet, her body seemed independent and unsubdued.", "30": "They drifted, with their plates and cups, back to the music-room. When Thea followed them, Ottenburg put down his tea suddenly. \u201cAren't you taking anything? Please let me.\u201d He started back to the table.", "31": "\u201cNo, thank you, nothing. I'm going to run over that aria for you presently, to convince you that I can do it. How did the duet go, with Schlag?\u201d", "32": "She was standing in the doorway and Fred came up to her: \u201cThat you'll never do any better. You've worked your voice into it perfectly. Every NUANCE\u2014wonderful!\u201d", "33": "\u201cThink so?\u201d She gave him a sidelong glance and spoke with a certain gruff shyness which did not deceive anybody, and was not meant to deceive. The tone was equivalent to \u201cKeep it up. I like it, but I'm awkward with it.\u201d", "34": "Fred held her by the door and did keep it up, furiously, for full five minutes. She took it with some confusion, seeming all the while to be hesitating, to be arrested in her course and trying to pass him. But she did not really try to pass, and her color deepened. Fred spoke in German, and Archie caught from her an occasional JA? SO? muttered rather than spoken.", "35": "When they rejoined Landry and Dr. Archie, Fred took up his tea again. \u201cI see you're singing VENUS Saturday night. Will they never let you have a chance at ELIZABETH?\u201d", "36": "She shrugged her shoulders. \u201cNot here. There are so many singers here, and they try us out in such a stingy way. Think of it, last year I came over in October, and it was the first of December before I went on at all! I'm often sorry I left Dresden.\u201d", "37": "\u201cStill,\u201d Fred argued, \u201cDresden is limited.\u201d", "38": "\u201cJust so, and I've begun to sigh for those very limitations. In New York everything is impersonal. Your audience never knows its own mind, and its mind is never twice the same. I'd rather sing where the people are pig-headed and throw carrots at you if you don't do it the way they like it. The house here is splendid, and the night audiences are exciting. I hate the matinees; like singing at a KAFFEKLATSCH.\u201d She rose and turned on the lights.", "39": "\u201cAh!\u201d Fred exclaimed, \u201cwhy do you do that? That is a signal that tea is over.\u201d He got up and drew out his gloves.", "40": "\u201cNot at all. Shall you be here Saturday night?\u201d She sat down on the piano bench and leaned her elbow back on the keyboard. \u201cNecker sings ELIZABETH. Make Dr. Archie go. Everything she sings is worth hearing.\u201d", "41": "\u201cBut she's failing so. The last time I heard her she had no voice at all. She IS a poor vocalist!\u201d", "42": "Thea cut him off. \u201cShe's a great artist, whether she's in voice or not, and she's the only one here. If you want a big voice, you can take my ORTRUDE of last night; that's big enough, and vulgar enough.\u201d", "43": "Fred laughed and turned away, this time with decision. \u201cI don't want her!\u201d he protested energetically. \u201cI only wanted to get a rise out of you. I like Necker's ELIZABETH well enough. I like your VENUS well enough, too.\u201d", "44": "\u201cIt's a beautiful part, and it's often dreadfully sung. It's very hard to sing, of course.\u201d", "45": "Ottenburg bent over the hand she held out to him. \u201cFor an uninvited guest, I've fared very well. You were nice to let me come up. I'd have been terribly cut up if you'd sent me away. May I?\u201d He kissed her hand lightly and backed toward the door, still smiling, and promising to keep an eye on Archie. \u201cHe can't be trusted at all, Thea. One of the waiters at Martin's worked a Tourainian hare off on him at luncheon yesterday, for seven twenty-five.\u201d", "46": "Thea broke into a laugh, the deep one he recognized. \u201cDid he have a ribbon on, this hare? Did they bring him in a gilt cage?\u201d", "47": "\u201cNo,\u201d\u2014Archie spoke up for himself,\u2014\u201cthey brought him in a brown sauce, which was very good. He didn't taste very different from any rabbit.\u201d", "48": "\u201cProbably came from a push-cart on the East Side.\u201d Thea looked at her old friend commiseratingly. \u201cYes, DO keep an eye on him, Fred. I had no idea,\u201d shaking her head. \u201cYes, I'll be obliged to you.\u201d", "49": "\u201cCount on me!\u201d Their eyes met in a gay smile, and Fred bowed himself out."}, "VII": {"0": "ON Saturday night Dr. Archie went with Fred Ottenburg to hear \u201cTannhauser.\u201d Thea had a rehearsal on Sunday afternoon, but as she was not on the bill again until Wednesday, she promised to dine with Archie and Ottenburg on Monday, if they could make the dinner early.", "1": "At a little after eight on Monday evening, the three friends returned to Thea's apartment and seated themselves for an hour of quiet talk.", "2": "\u201cI'm sorry we couldn't have had Landry with us tonight,\u201d Thea said, \u201cbut he's on at Weber and Fields' every night now. You ought to hear him, Dr. Archie. He often sings the old Scotch airs you used to love.\u201d", "3": "\u201cWhy not go down this evening?\u201d Fred suggested hopefully, glancing at his watch. \u201cThat is, if you'd like to go. I can telephone and find what time he comes on.\u201d", "4": "Thea hesitated. \u201cNo, I think not. I took a long walk this afternoon and I'm rather tired. I think I can get to sleep early and be so much ahead. I don't mean at once, however,\u201d seeing Dr. Archie's disappointed look. \u201cI always like to hear Landry,\u201d she added. \u201cHe never had much voice, and it's worn, but there's a sweetness about it, and he sings with such taste.\u201d", "5": "\u201cYes, doesn't he? May I?\u201d Fred took out his cigarette case. \u201cIt really doesn't bother your throat?\u201d", "6": "\u201cA little doesn't. But cigar smoke does. Poor Dr. Archie! Can you do with one of those?\u201d", "7": "\u201cI'm learning to like them,\u201d the doctor declared, taking one from the case Fred proffered him.", "8": "\u201cLandry's the only fellow I know in this country who can do that sort of thing,\u201d Fred went on. \u201cLike the best English ballad singers. He can sing even popular stuff by higher lights, as it were.\u201d", "9": "Thea nodded. \u201cYes; sometimes I make him sing his most foolish things for me. It's restful, as he does it. That's when I'm homesick, Dr. Archie.\u201d", "10": "\u201cYou knew him in Germany, Thea?\u201d Dr. Archie had quietly abandoned his cigarette as a comfortless article. \u201cWhen you first went over?\u201d", "11": "\u201cYes. He was a good friend to a green girl. He helped me with my German and my music and my general discouragement. Seemed to care more about my getting on than about himself. He had no money, either. An old aunt had loaned him a little to study on.\u2014Will you answer that, Fred?\u201d", "12": "Fred caught up the telephone and stopped the buzz while Thea went on talking to Dr. Archie about Landry. Telling some one to hold the wire, he presently put down the instrument and approached Thea with a startled expression on his face.", "13": "\u201cIt's the management,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cGloeckler has broken down: fainting fits. Madame Rheinecker is in Atlantic City and Schramm is singing in Philadelphia tonight. They want to know whether you can come down and finish SIEGLINDE.\u201d", "14": "\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d", "15": "\u201cEight fifty-five. The first act is just over. They can hold the curtain twenty-five minutes.\u201d", "16": "Thea did not move. \u201cTwenty-five and thirty-five makes sixty,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTell them I'll come if they hold the curtain till I am in the dressing-room. Say I'll have to wear her costumes, and the dresser must have everything ready. Then call a taxi, please.\u201d", "17": "Thea had not changed her position since he first interrupted her, but she had grown pale and was opening and shutting her hands rapidly. She looked, Fred thought, terrified. He half turned toward the telephone, but hung on one foot.", "18": "\u201cHave you ever sung the part?\u201d he asked.", "19": "\u201cNo, but I've rehearsed it. That's all right. Get the cab.\u201d Still she made no move. She merely turned perfectly blank eyes to Dr. Archie and said absently, \u201cIt's curious, but just at this minute I can't remember a bar of 'Walkure' after the first act. And I let my maid go out.\u201d She sprang up and beckoned Archie without so much, he felt sure, as knowing who he was. \u201cCome with me.\u201d She went quickly into her sleeping-chamber and threw open a door into a trunk-room. \u201cSee that white trunk? It's not locked. It's full of wigs, in boxes. Look until you find one marked 'Ring 2.' Bring it quick!\u201d While she directed him, she threw open a square trunk and began tossing out shoes of every shape and color.", "20": "Ottenburg appeared at the door. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d", "21": "She threw him some white sandals with long laces and silk stockings pinned to them. \u201cPut those in something, and then go to the piano and give me a few measures in there\u2014you know.\u201d She was behaving somewhat like a cyclone now, and while she wrenched open drawers and closet doors, Ottenburg got to the piano as quickly as possible and began to herald the reappearance of the Volsung pair, trusting to memory.", "22": "In a few moments Thea came out enveloped in her long fur coat with a scarf over her head and knitted woolen gloves on her hands. Her glassy eye took in the fact that Fred was playing from memory, and even in her distracted state, a faint smile flickered over her colorless lips. She stretched out a woolly hand, \u201cThe score, please. Behind you, there.\u201d", "23": "Dr. Archie followed with a canvas box and a satchel. As they went through the hall, the men caught up their hats and coats. They left the music-room, Fred noticed, just seven minutes after he got the telephone message. In the elevator Thea said in that husky whisper which had so perplexed Dr. Archie when he first heard it, \u201cTell the driver he must do it in twenty minutes, less if he can. He must leave the light on in the cab. I can do a good deal in twenty minutes. If only you hadn't made me eat\u2014Damn that duck!\u201d she broke out bitterly; \u201cwhy did you?\u201d", "24": "\u201cWish I had it back! But it won't bother you, to-night. You need strength,\u201d he pleaded consolingly.", "25": "But she only muttered angrily under her breath, \u201cIdiot, idiot!\u201d", "26": "Ottenburg shot ahead and instructed the driver, while the doctor put Thea into the cab and shut the door. She did not speak to either of them again. As the driver scrambled into his seat she opened the score and fixed her eyes upon it. Her face, in the white light, looked as bleak as a stone quarry.", "27": "As her cab slid away, Ottenburg shoved Archie into a second taxi that waited by the curb. \u201cWe'd better trail her,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere might be a hold-up of some kind.\u201d As the cab whizzed off he broke into an eruption of profanity.", "28": "\u201cWhat's the matter, Fred?\u201d the doctor asked. He was a good deal dazed by the rapid evolutions of the last ten minutes.", "29": "\u201cMatter enough!\u201d Fred growled, buttoning his overcoat with a shiver. \u201cWhat a way to sing a part for the first time! That duck really is on my conscience. It will be a wonder if she can do anything but quack! Scrambling on in the middle of a performance like this, with no rehearsal! The stuff she has to sing in there is a fright\u2014rhythm, pitch,\u2014and terribly difficult intervals.\u201d", "30": "\u201cShe looked frightened,\u201d Dr. Archie said thoughtfully, \u201cbut I thought she looked\u2014determined.\u201d", "31": "Fred sniffed. \u201cOh, determined! That's the kind of rough deal that makes savages of singers. Here's a part she's worked on and got ready for for years, and now they give her a chance to go on and butcher it. Goodness knows when she's looked at the score last, or whether she can use the business she's studied with this cast. Necker's singing BRUNNHILDE; she may help her, if it's not one of her sore nights.\u201d", "32": "\u201cIs she sore at Thea?\u201d Dr. Archie asked wonderingly.", "33": "\u201cMy dear man, Necker's sore at everything. She's breaking up; too early; just when she ought to be at her best. There's one story that she is struggling under some serious malady, another that she learned a bad method at the Prague Conservatory and has ruined her organ. She's the sorest thing in the world. If she weathers this winter through, it'll be her last. She's paying for it with the last rags of her voice. And then\u2014\u201d Fred whistled softly.", "34": "\u201cWell, what then?\u201d", "35": "\u201cThen our girl may come in for some of it. It's dog eat dog, in this game as in every other.\u201d", "36": "The cab stopped and Fred and Dr. Archie hurried to the box office. The Monday-night house was sold out. They bought standing room and entered the auditorium just as the press representative of the house was thanking the audience for their patience and telling them that although Madame Gloeckler was too ill to sing, Miss Kronborg had kindly consented to finish her part. This announcement was met with vehement applause from the upper circles of the house.", "37": "\u201cShe has her\u2014constituents,\u201d Dr. Archie murmured.", "38": "\u201cYes, up there, where they're young and hungry. These people down here have dined too well. They won't mind, however. They like fires and accidents and DIVERTISSEMENTS. Two SIEGLINDES are more unusual than one, so they'll be satisfied.\u201d", "39": "After the final disappearance of the mother of Siegfried, Ottenburg and the doctor slipped out through the crowd and left the house. Near the stage entrance Fred found the driver who had brought Thea down. He dismissed him and got a larger car. He and Archie waited on the sidewalk, and when Kronborg came out alone they gathered her into the cab and sprang in after her.", "40": "Thea sank back into a corner of the back seat and yawned. \u201cWell, I got through, eh?\u201d Her tone was reassuring. \u201cOn the whole, I think I've given you gentlemen a pretty lively evening, for one who has no social accomplishments.\u201d", "41": "\u201cRather! There was something like a popular uprising at the end of the second act. Archie and I couldn't keep it up as long as the rest of them did. A howl like that ought to show the management which way the wind is blowing. You probably know you were magnificent.\u201d", "42": "\u201cI thought it went pretty well,\u201d she spoke impartially. \u201cI was rather smart to catch his tempo there, at the beginning of the first recitative, when he came in too soon, don't you think? It's tricky in there, without a rehearsal. Oh, I was all right! He took that syncopation too fast in the beginning. Some singers take it fast there\u2014think it sounds more impassioned. That's one way!\u201d She sniffed, and Fred shot a mirthful glance at Archie. Her boastfulness would have been childish in a schoolboy. In the light of what she had done, of the strain they had lived through during the last two hours, it made one laugh,\u2014almost cry. She went on, robustly: \u201cAnd I didn't feel my dinner, really, Fred. I am hungry again, I'm ashamed to say,\u2014and I forgot to order anything at my hotel.\u201d", "43": "Fred put his hand on the door. \u201cWhere to? You must have food.\u201d", "44": "\u201cDo you know any quiet place, where I won't be stared at? I've still got make-up on.\u201d", "45": "\u201cI do. Nice English chop-house on Forty-fourth Street. Nobody there at night but theater people after the show, and a few bachelors.\u201d He opened the door and spoke to the driver.", "46": "As the car turned, Thea reached across to the front seat and drew Dr. Archie's handkerchief out of his breast pocket.", "47": "\u201cThis comes to me naturally,\u201d she said, rubbing her cheeks and eyebrows. \u201cWhen I was little I always loved your handkerchiefs because they were silk and smelled of Cologne water. I think they must have been the only really clean handkerchiefs in Moonstone. You were always wiping my face with them, when you met me out in the dust, I remember. Did I never have any?\u201d", "48": "\u201cI think you'd nearly always used yours up on your baby brother.\u201d", "49": "Thea sighed. \u201cYes, Thor had such a way of getting messy. You say he's a good chauffeur?\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment as if they were tired. Suddenly she looked up. \u201cIsn't it funny, how we travel in circles? Here you are, still getting me clean, and Fred is still feeding me. I would have died of starvation at that boarding-house on Indiana Avenue if he hadn't taken me out to the Buckingham and filled me up once in a while. What a cavern I was to fill, too. The waiters used to look astonished. I'm still singing on that food.\u201d", "50": "Fred alighted and gave Thea his arm as they crossed the icy sidewalk. They were taken upstairs in an antiquated lift and found the cheerful chop-room half full of supper parties. An English company playing at the Empire had just come in. The waiters, in red waistcoats, were hurrying about. Fred got a table at the back of the room, in a corner, and urged his waiter to get the oysters on at once.", "51": "\u201cTakes a few minutes to open them, sir,\u201d the man expostulated.", "52": "\u201cYes, but make it as few as possible, and bring the lady's first. Then grilled chops with kidneys, and salad.\u201d", "53": "Thea began eating celery stalks at once, from the base to the foliage. \u201cNecker said something nice to me tonight. You might have thought the management would say something, but not they.\u201d She looked at Fred from under her blackened lashes. \u201cIt WAS a stunt, to jump in and sing that second act without rehearsal. It doesn't sing itself.\u201d", "54": "Ottenburg was watching her brilliant eyes and her face. She was much handsomer than she had been early in the evening. Excitement of this sort enriched her. It was only under such excitement, he reflected, that she was entirely illuminated, or wholly present. At other times there was something a little cold and empty, like a big room with no people in it. Even in her most genial moods there was a shadow of restlessness, as if she were waiting for something and were exercising the virtue of patience. During dinner she had been as kind as she knew how to be, to him and to Archie, and had given them as much of herself as she could. But, clearly, she knew only one way of being really kind, from the core of her heart out; and there was but one way in which she could give herself to people largely and gladly, spontaneously. Even as a girl she had been at her best in vigorous effort, he remembered; physical effort, when there was no other kind at hand. She could be expansive only in explosions. Old Nathanmeyer had seen it. In the very first song Fred had ever heard her sing, she had unconsciously declared it.", "55": "Thea Kronborg turned suddenly from her talk with Archie and peered suspiciously into the corner where Ottenburg sat with folded arms, observing her. \u201cWhat's the matter with you, Fred? I'm afraid of you when you're quiet,\u2014fortunately you almost never are. What are you thinking about?\u201d", "56": "\u201cI was wondering how you got right with the orchestra so quickly, there at first. I had a flash of terror,\u201d he replied easily.", "57": "She bolted her last oyster and ducked her head. \u201cSo had I! I don't know how I did catch it. Desperation, I suppose; same way the Indian babies swim when they're thrown into the river. I HAD to. Now it's over, I'm glad I had to. I learned a whole lot to-night.\u201d", "58": "Archie, who usually felt that it behooved him to be silent during such discussions, was encouraged by her geniality to venture, \u201cI don't see how you can learn anything in such a turmoil; or how you can keep your mind on it, for that matter.\u201d", "59": "Thea glanced about the room and suddenly put her hand up to her hair. \u201cMercy, I've no hat on! Why didn't you tell me? And I seem to be wearing a rumpled dinner dress, with all this paint on my face! I must look like something you picked up on Second Avenue. I hope there are no Colorado reformers about, Dr. Archie. What a dreadful old pair these people must be thinking you! Well, I had to eat.\u201d She sniffed the savor of the grill as the waiter uncovered it. \u201cYes, draught beer, please. No, thank you, Fred, NO champagne.\u2014To go back to your question, Dr. Archie, you can believe I keep my mind on it. That's the whole trick, in so far as stage experience goes; keeping right there every second. If I think of anything else for a flash, I'm gone, done for. But at the same time, one can take things in\u2014with another part of your brain, maybe. It's different from what you get in study, more practical and conclusive. There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm. You learn the delivery of a part only before an audience.\u201d", "60": "\u201cHeaven help us,\u201d gasped Ottenburg. \u201cWeren't you hungry, though! It's beautiful to see you eat.\u201d", "61": "\u201cGlad you like it. Of course I'm hungry. Are you staying over for 'Rheingold' Friday afternoon?\u201d", "62": "\u201cMy dear Thea,\u201d\u2014Fred lit a cigarette,\u2014\u201cI'm a serious business man now. I have to sell beer. I'm due in Chicago on Wednesday. I'd come back to hear you, but FRICKA is not an alluring part.\u201d", "63": "\u201cThen you've never heard it well done.\u201d She spoke up hotly. \u201cFat German woman scolding her husband, eh? That's not my idea. Wait till you hear my FRICKA. It's a beautiful part.\u201d Thea leaned forward on the table and touched Archie's arm. \u201cYou remember, Dr. Archie, how my mother always wore her hair, parted in the middle and done low on her neck behind, so you got the shape of her head and such a calm, white forehead? I wear mine like that for FRICKA. A little more coronet effect, built up a little higher at the sides, but the idea's the same. I think you'll notice it.\u201d She turned to Ottenburg reproachfully: \u201cIt's noble music, Fred, from the first measure. There's nothing lovelier than the WONNIGER HAUSRATH. It's all such comprehensive sort of music\u2014fateful. Of course, FRICKA KNOWS,\u201d Thea ended quietly.", "64": "Fred sighed. \u201cThere, you've spoiled my itinerary. Now I'll have to come back, of course. Archie, you'd better get busy about seats to-morrow.\u201d", "65": "\u201cI can get you box seats, somewhere. I know nobody here, and I never ask for any.\u201d Thea began hunting among her wraps. \u201cOh, how funny! I've only these short woolen gloves, and no sleeves. Put on my coat first. Those English people can't make out where you got your lady, she's so made up of contradictions.\u201d She rose laughing and plunged her arms into the coat Dr. Archie held for her. As she settled herself into it and buttoned it under her chin, she gave him an old signal with her eyelid. \u201cI'd like to sing another part to-night. This is the sort of evening I fancy, when there's something to do. Let me see: I have to sing in 'Trovatore' Wednesday night, and there are rehearsals for the 'Ring' every day this week. Consider me dead until Saturday, Dr. Archie. I invite you both to dine with me on Saturday night, the day after 'Rheingold.' And Fred must leave early, for I want to talk to you alone. You've been here nearly a week, and I haven't had a serious word with you. TAK FOR MAD, Fred, as the Norwegians say.\u201d"}, "VIII": {"0": "THE \u201cRing of the Niebelungs\u201d was to be given at the Metropolitan on four successive Friday afternoons. After the first of these performances, Fred Ottenburg went home with Landry for tea. Landry was one of the few public entertainers who own real estate in New York. He lived in a little three-story brick house on Jane Street, in Greenwich Village, which had been left to him by the same aunt who paid for his musical education.", "1": "Landry was born, and spent the first fifteen years of his life, on a rocky Connecticut farm not far from Cos Cob. His father was an ignorant, violent man, a bungling farmer and a brutal husband. The farmhouse, dilapidated and damp, stood in a hollow beside a marshy pond. Oliver had worked hard while he lived at home, although he was never clean or warm in winter and had wretched food all the year round. His spare, dry figure, his prominent larynx, and the peculiar red of his face and hands belonged to the choreboy he had never outgrown. It was as if the farm, knowing he would escape from it as early as he could, had ground its mark on him deep. When he was fifteen Oliver ran away and went to live with his Catholic aunt, on Jane Street, whom his mother was never allowed to visit. The priest of St. Joseph's Parish discovered that he had a voice.", "2": "Landry had an affection for the house on Jane Street, where he had first learned what cleanliness and order and courtesy were. When his aunt died he had the place done over, got an Irish housekeeper, and lived there with a great many beautiful things he had collected. His living expenses were never large, but he could not restrain himself from buying graceful and useless objects. He was a collector for much the same reason that he was a Catholic, and he was a Catholic chiefly because his father used to sit in the kitchen and read aloud to his hired men disgusting \u201cexposures\u201d of the Roman Church, enjoying equally the hideous stories and the outrage to his wife's feelings.", "3": "At first Landry bought books; then rugs, drawings, china. He had a beautiful collection of old French and Spanish fans. He kept them in an escritoire he had brought from Spain, but there were always a few of them lying about in his sitting-room.", "4": "While Landry and his guest were waiting for the tea to be brought, Ottenburg took up one of these fans from the low marble mantel-shelf and opened it in the firelight. One side was painted with a pearly sky and floating clouds. On the other was a formal garden where an elegant shepherdess with a mask and crook was fleeing on high heels from a satin-coated shepherd.", "5": "\u201cYou ought not to keep these things about, like this, Oliver. The dust from your grate must get at them.\u201d", "6": "\u201cIt does, but I get them to enjoy them, not to have them. They're pleasant to glance at and to play with at odd times like this, when one is waiting for tea or something.\u201d", "7": "Fred smiled. The idea of Landry stretched out before his fire playing with his fans, amused him. Mrs. McGinnis brought the tea and put it before the hearth: old teacups that were velvety to the touch and a pot-bellied silver cream pitcher of an Early Georgian pattern, which was always brought, though Landry took rum.", "8": "Fred drank his tea walking about, examining Landry's sumptuous writing-table in the alcove and the Boucher drawing in red chalk over the mantel. \u201cI don't see how you can stand this place without a heroine. It would give me a raging thirst for gallantries.\u201d", "9": "Landry was helping himself to a second cup of tea. \u201cWorks quite the other way with me. It consoles me for the lack of her. It's just feminine enough to be pleasant to return to. Not any more tea? Then sit down and play for me. I'm always playing for other people, and I never have a chance to sit here quietly and listen.\u201d", "10": "Ottenburg opened the piano and began softly to boom forth the shadowy introduction to the opera they had just heard. \u201cWill that do?\u201d he asked jokingly. \u201cI can't seem to get it out of my head.\u201d", "11": "\u201cOh, excellently! Thea told me it was quite wonderful, the way you can do Wagner scores on the piano. So few people can give one any idea of the music. Go ahead, as long as you like. I can smoke, too.\u201d Landry flattened himself out on his cushions and abandoned himself to ease with the circumstance of one who has never grown quite accustomed to ease.", "12": "Ottenburg played on, as he happened to remember. He understood now why Thea wished him to hear her in \u201cRheingold.\u201d It had been clear to him as soon as FRICKA rose from sleep and looked out over the young world, stretching one white arm toward the new Gotterburg shining on the heights. \u201cWOTAN! GEMAHL! ERWACHE!\u201d She was pure Scandinavian, this FRICKA: \u201cSwedish summer\u201d! he remembered old Mr. Nathanmeyer's phrase. She had wished him to see her because she had a distinct kind of loveliness for this part, a shining beauty like the light of sunset on distant sails. She seemed to take on the look of immortal loveliness, the youth of the golden apples, the shining body and the shining mind. FRICKA had been a jealous spouse to him for so long that he had forgot she meant wisdom before she meant domestic order, and that, in any event, she was always a goddess. The FRICKA of that afternoon was so clear and sunny, so nobly conceived, that she made a whole atmosphere about herself and quite redeemed from shabbiness the helplessness and unscrupulousness of the gods. Her reproaches to WOTAN were the pleadings of a tempered mind, a consistent sense of beauty. In the long silences of her part, her shining presence was a visible complement to the discussion of the orchestra. As the themes which were to help in weaving the drama to its end first came vaguely upon the ear, one saw their import and tendency in the face of this clearest-visioned of the gods.", "13": "In the scene between FRICKA and WOTAN, Ottenburg stopped. \u201cI can't seem to get the voices, in there.\u201d", "14": "Landry chuckled. \u201cDon't try. I know it well enough. I expect I've been over that with her a thousand times. I was playing for her almost every day when she was first working on it. When she begins with a part she's hard to work with: so slow you'd think she was stupid if you didn't know her. Of course she blames it all on her accompanist. It goes on like that for weeks sometimes. This did. She kept shaking her head and staring and looking gloomy. All at once, she got her line\u2014it usually comes suddenly, after stretches of not getting anywhere at all\u2014and after that it kept changing and clearing. As she worked her voice into it, it got more and more of that 'gold' quality that makes her FRICKA so different.\u201d", "15": "Fred began FRICKA'S first aria again. \u201cIt's certainly different. Curious how she does it. Such a beautiful idea, out of a part that's always been so ungrateful. She's a lovely thing, but she was never so beautiful as that, really. Nobody is.\u201d He repeated the loveliest phrase. \u201cHow does she manage it, Landry? You've worked with her.\u201d", "16": "Landry drew cherishingly on the last cigarette he meant to permit himself before singing. \u201cOh, it's a question of a big personality\u2014and all that goes with it. Brains, of course. Imagination, of course. But the important thing is that she was born full of color, with a rich personality. That's a gift of the gods, like a fine nose. You have it, or you haven't. Against it, intelligence and musicianship and habits of industry don't count at all. Singers are a conventional race. When Thea was studying in Berlin the other girls were mortally afraid of her. She has a pretty rough hand with women, dull ones, and she could be rude, too! The girls used to call her DIE WOLFIN.\u201d", "17": "Fred thrust his hands into his pockets and leaned back against the piano. \u201cOf course, even a stupid woman could get effects with such machinery: such a voice and body and face. But they couldn't possibly belong to a stupid woman, could they?\u201d", "18": "Landry shook his head. \u201cIt's personality; that's as near as you can come to it. That's what constitutes real equipment. What she does is interesting because she does it. Even the things she discards are suggestive. I regret some of them. Her conceptions are colored in so many different ways. You've heard her ELIZABETH? Wonderful, isn't it? She was working on that part years ago when her mother was ill. I could see her anxiety and grief getting more and more into the part. The last act is heart-breaking. It's as homely as a country prayer meeting: might be any lonely woman getting ready to die. It's full of the thing every plain creature finds out for himself, but that never gets written down. It's unconscious memory, maybe; inherited memory, like folk-music. I call it personality.\u201d", "19": "Fred laughed, and turning to the piano began coaxing the FRICKA music again. \u201cCall it anything you like, my boy. I have a name for it myself, but I shan't tell you.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at Landry, stretched out by the fire. \u201cYou have a great time watching her, don't you?\u201d", "20": "\u201cOh, yes!\u201d replied Landry simply. \u201cI'm not interested in much that goes on in New York. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to dress.\u201d He rose with a reluctant sigh. \u201cCan I get you anything? Some whiskey?\u201d", "21": "\u201cThank you, no. I'll amuse myself here. I don't often get a chance at a good piano when I'm away from home. You haven't had this one long, have you? Action's a bit stiff. I say,\u201d he stopped Landry in the doorway, \u201chas Thea ever been down here?\u201d", "22": "Landry turned back. \u201cYes. She came several times when I had erysipelas. I was a nice mess, with two nurses. She brought down some inside window-boxes, planted with crocuses and things. Very cheering, only I couldn't see them or her.\u201d", "23": "\u201cDidn't she like your place?\u201d", "24": "\u201cShe thought she did, but I fancy it was a good deal cluttered up for her taste. I could hear her pacing about like something in a cage. She pushed the piano back against the wall and the chairs into corners, and she broke my amber elephant.\u201d Landry took a yellow object some four inches high from one of his low bookcases. \u201cYou can see where his leg is glued on,\u2014a souvenir. Yes, he's lemon amber, very fine.\u201d", "25": "Landry disappeared behind the curtains and in a moment Fred heard the wheeze of an atomizer. He put the amber elephant on the piano beside him and seemed to get a great deal of amusement out of the beast."}, "IX": {"0": "WHEN Archie and Ottenburg dined with Thea on Saturday evening, they were served downstairs in the hotel dining-room, but they were to have their coffee in her own apartment. As they were going up in the elevator after dinner, Fred turned suddenly to Thea. \u201cAnd why, please, did you break Landry's amber elephant?\u201d", "1": "She looked guilty and began to laugh. \u201cHasn't he got over that yet? I didn't really mean to break it. I was perhaps careless. His things are so over-petted that I was tempted to be careless with a lot of them.\u201d", "2": "\u201cHow can you be so heartless, when they're all he has in the world?\u201d", "3": "\u201cHe has me. I'm a great deal of diversion for him; all he needs. There,\u201d she said as she opened the door into her own hall, \u201cI shouldn't have said that before the elevator boy.\u201d", "4": "\u201cEven an elevator boy couldn't make a scandal about Oliver. He's such a catnip man.\u201d", "5": "Dr. Archie laughed, but Thea, who seemed suddenly to have thought of something annoying, repeated blankly, \u201cCatnip man?\u201d", "6": "\u201cYes, he lives on catnip, and rum tea. But he's not the only one. You are like an eccentric old woman I know in Boston, who goes about in the spring feeding catnip to street cats. You dispense it to a lot of fellows. Your pull seems to be more with men than with women, you know; with seasoned men, about my age, or older. Even on Friday afternoon I kept running into them, old boys I hadn't seen for years, thin at the part and thick at the girth, until I stood still in the draft and held my hair on. They're always there; I hear them talking about you in the smoking room. Probably we don't get to the point of apprehending anything good until we're about forty. Then, in the light of what is going, and of what, God help us! is coming, we arrive at understanding.\u201d", "7": "\u201cI don't see why people go to the opera, anyway,\u2014serious people.\u201d She spoke discontentedly. \u201cI suppose they get something, or think they do. Here's the coffee. There, please,\u201d she directed the waiter. Going to the table she began to pour the coffee, standing. She wore a white dress trimmed with crystals which had rattled a good deal during dinner, as all her movements had been impatient and nervous, and she had twisted the dark velvet rose at her girdle until it looked rumpled and weary. She poured the coffee as if it were a ceremony in which she did not believe. \u201cCan you make anything of Fred's nonsense, Dr. Archie?\u201d she asked, as he came to take his cup.", "8": "Fred approached her. \u201cMy nonsense is all right. The same brand has gone with you before. It's you who won't be jollied. What's the matter? You have something on your mind.\u201d", "9": "\u201cI've a good deal. Too much to be an agreeable hostess.\u201d She turned quickly away from the coffee and sat down on the piano bench, facing the two men. \u201cFor one thing, there's a change in the cast for Friday afternoon. They're going to let me sing SIEGLINDE.\u201d Her frown did not conceal the pleasure with which she made this announcement.", "10": "\u201cAre you going to keep us dangling about here forever, Thea? Archie and I are supposed to have other things to do.\u201d Fred looked at her with an excitement quite as apparent as her own.", "11": "\u201cHere I've been ready to sing SIEGLINDE for two years, kept in torment, and now it comes off within two weeks, just when I want to be seeing something of Dr. Archie. I don't know what their plans are down there. After Friday they may let me cool for several weeks, and they may rush me. I suppose it depends somewhat on how things go Friday afternoon.\u201d", "12": "\u201cOh, they'll go fast enough! That's better suited to your voice than anything you've sung here. That gives you every opportunity I've waited for.\u201d Ottenburg crossed the room and standing beside her began to play \u201cDU BIST DER LENZ.\u201d", "13": "With a violent movement Thea caught his wrists and pushed his hands away from the keys.", "14": "\u201cFred, can't you be serious? A thousand things may happen between this and Friday to put me out. Something will happen. If that part were sung well, as well as it ought to be, it would be one of the most beautiful things in the world. That's why it never is sung right, and never will be.\u201d She clenched her hands and opened them despairingly, looking out of the open window. \u201cIt's inaccessibly beautiful!\u201d she brought out sharply.", "15": "Fred and Dr. Archie watched her. In a moment she turned back to them. \u201cIt's impossible to sing a part like that well for the first time, except for the sort who will never sing it any better. Everything hangs on that first night, and that's bound to be bad. There you are,\u201d she shrugged impatiently. \u201cFor one thing, they change the cast at the eleventh hour and then rehearse the life out of me.\u201d", "16": "Ottenburg put down his cup with exaggerated care. \u201cStill, you really want to do it, you know.\u201d", "17": "\u201cWant to?\u201d she repeated indignantly; \u201cof course I want to! If this were only next Thursday night\u2014But between now and Friday I'll do nothing but fret away my strength. Oh, I'm not saying I don't need the rehearsals! But I don't need them strung out through a week. That system's well enough for phlegmatic singers; it only drains me. Every single feature of operatic routine is detrimental to me. I usually go on like a horse that's been fixed to lose a race. I have to work hard to do my worst, let alone my best. I wish you could hear me sing well, once,\u201d she turned to Fred defiantly; \u201cI have, a few times in my life, when there was nothing to gain by it.\u201d", "18": "Fred approached her again and held out his hand. \u201cI recall my instructions, and now I'll leave you to fight it out with Archie. He can't possibly represent managerial stupidity to you as I seem to have a gift for doing.\u201d", "19": "As he smiled down at her, his good humor, his good wishes, his understanding, embarrassed her and recalled her to herself. She kept her seat, still holding his hand. \u201cAll the same, Fred, isn't it too bad, that there are so many things\u2014\u201d She broke off with a shake of the head.", "20": "\u201cMy dear girl, if I could bridge over the agony between now and Friday for you\u2014But you know the rules of the game; why torment yourself? You saw the other night that you had the part under your thumb. Now walk, sleep, play with Archie, keep your tiger hungry, and she'll spring all right on Friday. I'll be there to see her, and there'll be more than I, I suspect. Harsanyi's on the Wilhelm der Grosse; gets in on Thursday.\u201d", "21": "\u201cHarsanyi?\u201d Thea's eye lighted. \u201cI haven't seen him for years. We always miss each other.\u201d She paused, hesitating. \u201cYes, I should like that. But he'll be busy, maybe?\u201d", "22": "\u201cHe gives his first concert at Carnegie Hall, week after next. Better send him a box if you can.\u201d", "23": "\u201cYes, I'll manage it.\u201d Thea took his hand again. \u201cOh, I should like that, Fred!\u201d she added impulsively. \u201cEven if I were put out, he'd get the idea,\u201d\u2014she threw back her head,\u2014\u201cfor there is an idea!\u201d", "24": "\u201cWhich won't penetrate here,\u201d he tapped his brow and began to laugh. \u201cYou are an ungrateful huzzy, COMME LES AUTRES!\u201d", "25": "Thea detained him as he turned away. She pulled a flower out of a bouquet on the piano and absently drew the stem through the lapel of his coat. \u201cI shall be walking in the Park to-morrow afternoon, on the reservoir path, between four and five, if you care to join me. You know that after Harsanyi I'd rather please you than anyone else. You know a lot, but he knows even more than you.\u201d", "26": "\u201cThank you. Don't try to analyze it. SCHLAFEN SIE WOHL!\u201d he kissed her fingers and waved from the door, closing it behind him.", "27": "\u201cHe's the right sort, Thea.\u201d Dr. Archie looked warmly after his disappearing friend. \u201cI've always hoped you'd make it up with Fred.\u201d", "28": "\u201cWell, haven't I? Oh, marry him, you mean! Perhaps it may come about, some day. Just at present he's not in the marriage market any more than I am, is he?\u201d", "29": "\u201cNo, I suppose not. It's a damned shame that a man like Ottenburg should be tied up as he is, wasting all the best years of his life. A woman with general paresis ought to be legally dead.\u201d", "30": "\u201cDon't let us talk about Fred's wife, please. He had no business to get into such a mess, and he had no business to stay in it. He's always been a softy where women were concerned.\u201d", "31": "\u201cMost of us are, I'm afraid,\u201d Dr. Archie admitted meekly.", "32": "\u201cToo much light in here, isn't there? Tires one's eyes. The stage lights are hard on mine.\u201d Thea began turning them out. \u201cWe'll leave the little one, over the piano.\u201d She sank down by Archie on the deep sofa. \u201cWe two have so much to talk about that we keep away from it altogether; have you noticed? We don't even nibble the edges. I wish we had Landry here to-night to play for us. He's very comforting.\u201d", "33": "\u201cI'm afraid you don't have enough personal life, outside your work, Thea.\u201d The doctor looked at her anxiously.", "34": "She smiled at him with her eyes half closed. \u201cMy dear doctor, I don't have any. Your work becomes your personal life. You are not much good until it does. It's like being woven into a big web. You can't pull away, because all your little tendrils are woven into the picture. It takes you up, and uses you, and spins you out; and that is your life. Not much else can happen to you.\u201d", "35": "\u201cDidn't you think of marrying, several years ago?\u201d", "36": "\u201cYou mean Nordquist? Yes; but I changed my mind. We had been singing a good deal together. He's a splendid creature.\u201d", "37": "\u201cWere you much in love with him, Thea?\u201d the doctor asked hopefully.", "38": "She smiled again. \u201cI don't think I know just what that expression means. I've never been able to find out. I think I was in love with you when I was little, but not with any one since then. There are a great many ways of caring for people. It's not, after all, a simple state, like measles or tonsilitis. Nordquist is a taking sort of man. He and I were out in a rowboat once in a terrible storm. The lake was fed by glaciers,\u2014ice water,\u2014and we couldn't have swum a stroke if the boat had filled. If we hadn't both been strong and kept our heads, we'd have gone down. We pulled for every ounce there was in us, and we just got off with our lives. We were always being thrown together like that, under some kind of pressure. Yes, for a while I thought he would make everything right.\u201d She paused and sank back, resting her head on a cushion, pressing her eyelids down with her fingers. \u201cYou see,\u201d she went on abruptly, \u201che had a wife and two children. He hadn't lived with her for several years, but when she heard that he wanted to marry again, she began to make trouble. He earned a good deal of money, but he was careless and always wretchedly in debt. He came to me one day and told me he thought his wife would settle for a hundred thousand marks and consent to a divorce. I got very angry and sent him away. Next day he came back and said he thought she'd take fifty thousand.\u201d", "39": "Dr. Archie drew away from her, to the end of the sofa.", "40": "\u201cGood God, Thea,\u201d\u2014He ran his handkerchief over his forehead. \u201cWhat sort of people\u2014\u201d He stopped and shook his head.", "41": "Thea rose and stood beside him, her hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat's exactly how it struck me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOh, we have things in common, things that go away back, under everything. You understand, of course. Nordquist didn't. He thought I wasn't willing to part with the money. I couldn't let myself buy him from Fru Nordquist, and he couldn't see why. He had always thought I was close about money, so he attributed it to that. I am careful,\u201d\u2014she ran her arm through Archie's and when he rose began to walk about the room with him. \u201cI can't be careless with money. I began the world on six hundred dollars, and it was the price of a man's life. Ray Kennedy had worked hard and been sober and denied himself, and when he died he had six hundred dollars to show for it. I always measure things by that six hundred dollars, just as I measure high buildings by the Moonstone standpipe. There are standards we can't get away from.\u201d", "42": "Dr. Archie took her hand. \u201cI don't believe we should be any happier if we did get away from them. I think it gives you some of your poise, having that anchor. You look,\u201d glancing down at her head and shoulders, \u201csometimes so like your mother.\u201d", "43": "\u201cThank you. You couldn't say anything nicer to me than that. On Friday afternoon, didn't you think?\u201d", "44": "\u201cYes, but at other times, too. I love to see it. Do you know what I thought about that first night when I heard you sing? I kept remembering the night I took care of you when you had pneumonia, when you were ten years old. You were a terribly sick child, and I was a country doctor without much experience. There were no oxygen tanks about then. You pretty nearly slipped away from me. If you had\u2014\u201d", "45": "Thea dropped her head on his shoulder. \u201cI'd have saved myself and you a lot of trouble, wouldn't I? Dear Dr. Archie!\u201d she murmured.", "46": "\u201cAs for me, life would have been a pretty bleak stretch, with you left out.\u201d The doctor took one of the crystal pendants that hung from her shoulder and looked into it thoughtfully. \u201cI guess I'm a romantic old fellow, underneath. And you've always been my romance. Those years when you were growing up were my happiest. When I dream about you, I always see you as a little girl.\u201d", "47": "They paused by the open window. \u201cDo you? Nearly all my dreams, except those about breaking down on the stage or missing trains, are about Moonstone. You tell me the old house has been pulled down, but it stands in my mind, every stick and timber. In my sleep I go all about it, and look in the right drawers and cupboards for everything. I often dream that I'm hunting for my rubbers in that pile of overshoes that was always under the hatrack in the hall. I pick up every overshoe and know whose it is, but I can't find my own. Then the school bell begins to ring and I begin to cry. That's the house I rest in when I'm tired. All the old furniture and the worn spots in the carpet\u2014it rests my mind to go over them.\u201d", "48": "They were looking out of the window. Thea kept his arm. Down on the river four battleships were anchored in line, brilliantly lighted, and launches were coming and going, bringing the men ashore. A searchlight from one of the ironclads was playing on the great headland up the river, where it makes its first resolute turn. Overhead the night-blue sky was intense and clear.", "49": "\u201cThere's so much that I want to tell you,\u201d she said at last, \u201cand it's hard to explain. My life is full of jealousies and disappointments, you know. You get to hating people who do contemptible work and who get on just as well as you do. There are many disappointments in my profession, and bitter, bitter contempts!\u201d Her face hardened, and looked much older. \u201cIf you love the good thing vitally, enough to give up for it all that one must give up for it, then you must hate the cheap thing just as hard. I tell you, there is such a thing as creative hate! A contempt that drives you through fire, makes you risk everything and lose everything, makes you a long sight better than you ever knew you could be.\u201d As she glanced at Dr. Archie's face, Thea stopped short and turned her own face away. Her eyes followed the path of the searchlight up the river and rested upon the illumined headland.", "50": "\u201cYou see,\u201d she went on more calmly, \u201cvoices are accidental things. You find plenty of good voices in common women, with common minds and common hearts. Look at that woman who sang ORTRUDE with me last week. She's new here and the people are wild about her. 'Such a beautiful volume of tone!' they say. I give you my word she's as stupid as an owl and as coarse as a pig, and any one who knows anything about singing would see that in an instant. Yet she's quite as popular as Necker, who's a great artist. How can I get much satisfaction out of the enthusiasm of a house that likes her atrociously bad performance at the same time that it pretends to like mine? If they like her, then they ought to hiss me off the stage. We stand for things that are irreconcilable, absolutely. You can't try to do things right and not despise the people who do them wrong. How can I be indifferent? If that doesn't matter, then nothing matters. Well, sometimes I've come home as I did the other night when you first saw me, so full of bitterness that it was as if my mind were full of daggers. And I've gone to sleep and wakened up in the Kohlers' garden, with the pigeons and the white rabbits, so happy! And that saves me.\u201d She sat down on the piano bench. Archie thought she had forgotten all about him, until she called his name. Her voice was soft now, and wonderfully sweet. It seemed to come from somewhere deep within her, there were such strong vibrations in it. \u201cYou see, Dr. Archie, what one really strives for in art is not the sort of thing you are likely to find when you drop in for a performance at the opera. What one strives for is so far away, so deep, so beautiful\u201d\u2014she lifted her shoulders with a long breath, folded her hands in her lap and sat looking at him with a resignation that made her face noble,\u2014\u201cthat there's nothing one can say about it, Dr. Archie.\u201d", "51": "Without knowing very well what it was all about, Archie was passionately stirred for her. \u201cI've always believed in you, Thea; always believed,\u201d he muttered.", "52": "She smiled and closed her eyes. \u201cThey save me: the old things, things like the Kohlers' garden. They are in everything I do.\u201d", "53": "\u201cIn what you sing, you mean?\u201d", "54": "\u201cYes. Not in any direct way,\u201d\u2014she spoke hurriedly,\u2014\u201cthe light, the color, the feeling. Most of all the feeling. It comes in when I'm working on a part, like the smell of a garden coming in at the window. I try all the new things, and then go back to the old. Perhaps my feelings were stronger then. A child's attitude toward everything is an artist's attitude. I am more or less of an artist now, but then I was nothing else. When I went with you to Chicago that first time, I carried with me the essentials, the foundation of all I do now. The point to which I could go was scratched in me then. I haven't reached it yet, by a long way.\u201d", "55": "Archie had a swift flash of memory. Pictures passed before him. \u201cYou mean,\u201d he asked wonderingly, \u201cthat you knew then that you were so gifted?\u201d", "56": "Thea looked up at him and smiled. \u201cOh, I didn't know anything! Not enough to ask you for my trunk when I needed it. But you see, when I set out from Moonstone with you, I had had a rich, romantic past. I had lived a long, eventful life, and an artist's life, every hour of it. Wagner says, in his most beautiful opera, that art is only a way of remembering youth. And the older we grow the more precious it seems to us, and the more richly we can present that memory. When we've got it all out,\u2014the last, the finest thrill of it, the brightest hope of it,\u201d\u2014she lifted her hand above her head and dropped it,\u2014\u201cthen we stop. We do nothing but repeat after that. The stream has reached the level of its source. That's our measure.\u201d", "57": "There was a long, warm silence. Thea was looking hard at the floor, as if she were seeing down through years and years, and her old friend stood watching her bent head. His look was one with which he used to watch her long ago, and which, even in thinking about her, had become a habit of his face. It was full of solicitude, and a kind of secret gratitude, as if to thank her for some inexpressible pleasure of the heart. Thea turned presently toward the piano and began softly to waken an old air:\u2014", "58": "Archie sat down and shaded his eyes with his hand. She turned her head and spoke to him over her shoulder. \u201cCome on, you know the words better than I.

When he reached the reservoir path he saw Thea ahead of him, walking rapidly against the wind. Except for that one figure, the path was deserted. A flock of gulls were hovering over the reservoir, seeming bewildered by the driving currents of snow that whirled above the black water and then disappeared within it. When he had almost overtaken Thea, Fred called to her, and she turned and waited for him with her back to the wind. Her hair and furs were powdered with snowflakes, and she looked like some rich-pelted animal, with warm blood, that had run in out of the woods. Fred laughed as he took her hand.", "1": "\u201cNo use asking how you do. You surely needn't feel much anxiety about Friday, when you can look like this.\u201d", "2": "She moved close to the iron fence to make room for him beside her, and faced the wind again. \u201cOh, I'm WELL enough, in so far as that goes. But I'm not lucky about stage appearances. I'm easily upset, and the most perverse things happen.\u201d", "3": "\u201cWhat's the matter? Do you still get nervous?\u201d", "4": "\u201cOf course I do. I don't mind nerves so much as getting numbed,\u201d Thea muttered, sheltering her face for a moment with her muff. \u201cI'm under a spell, you know, hoodooed. It's the thing I WANT to do that I can never do. Any other effects I can get easily enough.\u201d", "5": "\u201cYes, you get effects, and not only with your voice. That's where you have it over all the rest of them; you're as much at home on the stage as you were down in Panther Canyon\u2014as if you'd just been let out of a cage. Didn't you get some of your ideas down there?\u201d", "6": "Thea nodded. \u201cOh, yes! For heroic parts, at least. Out of the rocks, out of the dead people. You mean the idea of standing up under things, don't you, meeting catastrophe? No fussiness. Seems to me they must have been a reserved, somber people, with only a muscular language, all their movements for a purpose; simple, strong, as if they were dealing with fate bare-handed.\u201d She put her gloved fingers on Fred's arm. \u201cI don't know how I can ever thank you enough. I don't know if I'd ever have got anywhere without Panther Canyon. How did you know that was the one thing to do for me? It's the sort of thing nobody ever helps one to, in this world. One can learn how to sing, but no singing teacher can give anybody what I got down there. How did you know?\u201d", "7": "\u201cI didn't know. Anything else would have done as well. It was your creative hour. I knew you were getting a lot, but I didn't realize how much.\u201d", "8": "Thea walked on in silence. She seemed to be thinking.", "9": "\u201cDo you know what they really taught me?\u201d she came out suddenly. \u201cThey taught me the inevitable hardness of human life. No artist gets far who doesn't know that. And you can't know it with your mind. You have to realize it in your body, somehow; deep. It's an animal sort of feeling. I sometimes think it's the strongest of all. Do you know what I'm driving at?\u201d", "10": "\u201cI think so. Even your audiences feel it, vaguely: that you've sometime or other faced things that make you different.\u201d", "11": "Thea turned her back to the wind, wiping away the snow that clung to her brows and lashes. \u201cUgh!\u201d she exclaimed; \u201cno matter how long a breath you have, the storm has a longer. I haven't signed for next season, yet, Fred. I'm holding out for a big contract: forty performances. Necker won't be able to do much next winter. It's going to be one of those between seasons; the old singers are too old, and the new ones are too new. They might as well risk me as anybody. So I want good terms. The next five or six years are going to be my best.\u201d", "12": "\u201cYou'll get what you demand, if you are uncompromising. I'm safe in congratulating you now.\u201d", "13": "Thea laughed. \u201cIt's a little early. I may not get it at all. They don't seem to be breaking their necks to meet me.

That, after all, is the unusual thing.\u201d", "16": "She looked at him sharply, with a certain apprehension. \u201cCare? Why shouldn't I care? If I didn't, I'd be in a bad way. What else have I got?\u201d She stopped with a challenging interrogation, but Ottenburg did not reply. \u201cYou mean,\u201d she persisted, \u201cthat you don't care as much as you used to?\u201d", "17": "\u201cI care about your success, of course.\u201d Fred fell into a slower pace. Thea felt at once that he was talking seriously and had dropped the tone of half-ironical exaggeration he had used with her of late years. \u201cAnd I'm grateful to you for what you demand from yourself, when you might get off so easily. You demand more and more all the time, and you'll do more and more. One is grateful to anybody for that; it makes life in general a little less sordid. But as a matter of fact, I'm not much interested in how anybody sings anything.\u201d", "18": "\u201cThat's too bad of you, when I'm just beginning to see what is worth doing, and how I want to do it!\u201d Thea spoke in an injured tone.", "19": "\u201cThat's what I congratulate you on. That's the great difference between your kind and the rest of us. It's how long you're able to keep it up that tells the story. When you needed enthusiasm from the outside, I was able to give it to you. Now you must let me withdraw.\u201d", "20": "\u201cI'm not tying you, am I?\u201d she flashed out. \u201cBut withdraw to what? What do you want?\u201d", "21": "Fred shrugged. \u201cI might ask you, What have I got? I want things that wouldn't interest you; that you probably wouldn't understand. For one thing, I want a son to bring up.\u201d", "22": "\u201cI can understand that. It seems to me reasonable. Have you also found somebody you want to marry?\u201d", "23": "\u201cNot particularly.\u201d They turned another curve, which brought the wind to their backs, and they walked on in comparative calm, with the snow blowing past them. \u201cIt's not your fault, Thea, but I've had you too much in my mind. I've not given myself a fair chance in other directions. I was in Rome when you and Nordquist were there. If that had kept up, it might have cured me.\u201d", "24": "\u201cIt might have cured a good many things,\u201d remarked Thea grimly.", "25": "Fred nodded sympathetically and went on. \u201cIn my library in St. Louis, over the fireplace, I have a property spear I had copied from one in Venice,\u2014oh, years ago, after you first went abroad, while you were studying. You'll probably be singing BRUNNHILDE pretty soon now, and I'll send it on to you, if I may. You can take it and its history for what they're worth. But I'm nearly forty years old, and I've served my turn. You've done what I hoped for you, what I was honestly willing to lose you for\u2014then. I'm older now, and I think I was an ass. I wouldn't do it again if I had the chance, not much! But I'm not sorry. It takes a great many people to make one\u2014BRUNNHILDE.\u201d", "26": "Thea stopped by the fence and looked over into the black choppiness on which the snowflakes fell and disappeared with magical rapidity. Her face was both angry and troubled. \u201cSo you really feel I've been ungrateful. I thought you sent me out to get something. I didn't know you wanted me to bring in something easy. I thought you wanted something\u2014\u201d She took a deep breath and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cBut there! nobody on God's earth wants it, REALLY! If one other person wanted it,\u201d\u2014she thrust her hand out before him and clenched it,\u2014\u201cmy God, what I could do!\u201d", "27": "Fred laughed dismally. \u201cEven in my ashes I feel myself pushing you! How can anybody help it? My dear girl, can't you see that anybody else who wanted it as you do would be your rival, your deadliest danger? Can't you see that it's your great good fortune that other people can't care about it so much?\u201d", "28": "But Thea seemed not to take in his protest at all. She went on vindicating herself. \u201cIt's taken me a long while to do anything, of course, and I've only begun to see daylight. But anything good is\u2014expensive. It hasn't seemed long. I've always felt responsible to you.\u201d", "29": "Fred looked at her face intently, through the veil of snowflakes, and shook his head. \u201cTo me? You are a truthful woman, and you don't mean to lie to me. But after the one responsibility you do feel, I doubt if you've enough left to feel responsible to God! Still, if you've ever in an idle hour fooled yourself with thinking I had anything to do with it, Heaven knows I'm grateful.\u201d", "30": "\u201cEven if I'd married Nordquist,\u201d Thea went on, turning down the path again, \u201cthere would have been something left out. There always is. In a way, I've always been married to you. I'm not very flexible; never was and never shall be. You caught me young. I could never have that over again. One can't, after one begins to know anything. But I look back on it. My life hasn't been a gay one, any more than yours. If I shut things out from you, you shut them out from me. We've been a help and a hindrance to each other. I guess it's always that way, the good and the bad all mixed up. There's only one thing that's all beautiful\u2014and always beautiful! That's why my interest keeps up.\u201d", "31": "\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Fred looked sidewise at the outline of her head against the thickening atmosphere. \u201cAnd you give one the impression that that is enough. I've gradually, gradually given you up.\u201d", "32": "\u201cSee, the lights are coming out.\u201d Thea pointed to where they flickered, flashes of violet through the gray tree-tops. Lower down the globes along the drives were becoming a pale lemon color. \u201cYes, I don't see why anybody wants to marry an artist, anyhow. I remember Ray Kennedy used to say he didn't see how any woman could marry a gambler, for she would only be marrying what the game left.\u201d She shook her shoulders impatiently. \u201cWho marries who is a small matter, after all. But I hope I can bring back your interest in my work. You've cared longer and more than anybody else, and I'd like to have somebody human to make a report to once in a while. You can send me your spear. I'll do my best. If you're not interested, I'll do my best anyhow. I've only a few friends, but I can lose every one of them, if it has to be. I learned how to lose when my mother died.\u2014We must hurry now. My taxi must be waiting.\u201d", "33": "The blue light about them was growing deeper and darker, and the falling snow and the faint trees had become violet. To the south, over Broadway, there was an orange reflection in the clouds. Motors and carriage lights flashed by on the drive below the reservoir path, and the air was strident with horns and shrieks from the whistles of the mounted policemen.", "34": "Fred gave Thea his arm as they descended from the embankment. \u201cI guess you'll never manage to lose me or Archie, Thea. You do pick up queer ones. But loving you is a heroic discipline. It wears a man out. Tell me one thing: could I have kept you, once, if I'd put on every screw?\u201d", "35": "Thea hurried him along, talking rapidly, as if to get it over. \u201cYou might have kept me in misery for a while, perhaps. I don't know. I have to think well of myself, to work. You could have made it hard. I'm not ungrateful. I was a difficult proposition to deal with. I understand now, of course. Since you didn't tell me the truth in the beginning, you couldn't very well turn back after I'd set my head. At least, if you'd been the sort who could, you wouldn't have had to,\u2014for I'd not have cared a button for that sort, even then.\u201d She stopped beside a car that waited at the curb and gave him her hand. \u201cThere. We part friends?\u201d", "36": "Fred looked at her. \u201cYou know. Ten years.\u201d", "37": "\u201cI'm not ungrateful,\u201d Thea repeated as she got into her cab.", "38": "\u201cYes,\u201d she reflected, as the taxi cut into the Park carriage road, \u201cwe don't get fairy tales in this world, and he has, after all, cared more and longer than anybody else.\u201d It was dark outside now, and the light from the lamps along the drive flashed into the cab. The snowflakes hovered like swarms of white bees about the globes.", "39": "Thea sat motionless in one corner staring out of the window at the cab lights that wove in and out among the trees, all seeming to be bent upon joyous courses. Taxicabs were still new in New York, and the theme of popular minstrelsy. Landry had sung her a ditty he heard in some theater on Third Avenue, about:", "40": "\u201cBut there passed him a bright-eyed taxi With the girl of his heart inside.\u201d", "41": "Almost inaudibly Thea began to hum the air, though she was thinking of something serious, something that had touched her deeply. At the beginning of the season, when she was not singing often, she had gone one afternoon to hear Paderewski's recital. In front of her sat an old German couple, evidently poor people who had made sacrifices to pay for their excellent seats. Their intelligent enjoyment of the music, and their friendliness with each other, had interested her more than anything on the programme. When the pianist began a lovely melody in the first movement of the Beethoven D minor sonata, the old lady put out her plump hand and touched her husband's sleeve and they looked at each other in recognition. They both wore glasses, but such a look! Like forget-menots, and so full of happy recollections. Thea wanted to put her arms around them and ask them how they had been able to keep a feeling like that, like a nosegay in a glass of water."}, "XI": {"0": "DR. ARCHIE saw nothing of Thea during the following week. After several fruitless efforts, he succeeded in getting a word with her over the telephone, but she sounded so distracted and driven that he was glad to say good-night and hang up the instrument. There were, she told him, rehearsals not only for \u201cWalkure,\u201d but also for \u201cGotterdammerung,\u201d in which she was to sing WALTRAUTE two weeks later.", "1": "On Thursday afternoon Thea got home late, after an exhausting rehearsal. She was in no happy frame of mind. Madame Necker, who had been very gracious to her that night when she went on to complete Gloeckler's performance of SIEGLINDE, had, since Thea was cast to sing the part instead of Gloeckler in the production of the \u201cRing,\u201d been chilly and disapproving, distinctly hostile. Thea had always felt that she and Necker stood for the same sort of endeavor, and that Necker recognized it and had a cordial feeling for her. In Germany she had several times sung BRANGAENA to Necker's ISOLDE, and the older artist had let her know that she thought she sang it beautifully. It was a bitter disappointment to find that the approval of so honest an artist as Necker could not stand the test of any significant recognition by the management. Madame Necker was forty, and her voice was failing just when her powers were at their height. Every fresh young voice was an enemy, and this one was accompanied by gifts which she could not fail to recognize.", "2": "Thea had her dinner sent up to her apartment, and it was a very poor one. She tasted the soup and then indignantly put on her wraps to go out and hunt a dinner. As she was going to the elevator, she had to admit that she was behaving foolishly. She took off her hat and coat and ordered another dinner. When it arrived, it was no better than the first. There was even a burnt match under the milk toast. She had a sore throat, which made swallowing painful and boded ill for the morrow. Although she had been speaking in whispers all day to save her throat, she now perversely summoned the housekeeper and demanded an account of some laundry that had been lost. The housekeeper was indifferent and impertinent, and Thea got angry and scolded violently. She knew it was very bad for her to get into a rage just before bedtime, and after the housekeeper left she realized that for ten dollars' worth of underclothing she had been unfitting herself for a performance which might eventually mean many thousands. The best thing now was to stop reproaching herself for her lack of sense, but she was too tired to control her thoughts.", "3": "While she was undressing\u2014Therese was brushing out her SIEGLINDE wig in the trunk-room\u2014she went on chiding herself bitterly. \u201cAnd how am I ever going to get to sleep in this state?\u201d she kept asking herself. \u201cIf I don't sleep, I'll be perfectly worthless to-morrow. I'll go down there to-morrow and make a fool of myself. If I'd let that laundry alone with whatever nigger has stolen it\u2014WHY did I undertake to reform the management of this hotel to-night? After to-morrow I could pack up and leave the place. There's the Phillamon\u2014I liked the rooms there better, anyhow\u2014and the Umberto\u2014\u201d She began going over the advantages and disadvantages of different apartment hotels. Suddenly she checked herself. \u201cWhat AM I doing this for? I can't move into another hotel to-night. I'll keep this up till morning. I shan't sleep a wink.\u201d", "4": "Should she take a hot bath, or shouldn't she? Sometimes it relaxed her, and sometimes it roused her and fairly put her beside herself. Between the conviction that she must sleep and the fear that she couldn't, she hung paralyzed. When she looked at her bed, she shrank from it in every nerve. She was much more afraid of it than she had ever been of the stage of any opera house. It yawned before her like the sunken road at Waterloo.", "5": "She rushed into her bathroom and locked the door. She would risk the bath, and defer the encounter with the bed a little longer. She lay in the bath half an hour. The warmth of the water penetrated to her bones, induced pleasant reflections and a feeling of well-being. It was very nice to have Dr. Archie in New York, after all, and to see him get so much satisfaction out of the little companionship she was able to give him. She liked people who got on, and who became more interesting as they grew older. There was Fred; he was much more interesting now than he had been at thirty. He was intelligent about music, and he must be very intelligent in his business, or he would not be at the head of the Brewers' Trust. She respected that kind of intelligence and success. Any success was good. She herself had made a good start, at any rate, and now, if she could get to sleep\u2014Yes, they were all more interesting than they used to be. Look at Harsanyi, who had been so long retarded; what a place he had made for himself in Vienna. If she could get to sleep, she would show him something to-morrow that he would understand.", "6": "She got quickly into bed and moved about freely between the sheets. Yes, she was warm all over. A cold, dry breeze was coming in from the river, thank goodness! She tried to think about her little rock house and the Arizona sun and the blue sky. But that led to memories which were still too disturbing. She turned on her side, closed her eyes, and tried an old device.", "7": "She entered her father's front door, hung her hat and coat on the rack, and stopped in the parlor to warm her hands at the stove. Then she went out through the diningroom, where the boys were getting their lessons at the long table; through the sitting-room, where Thor was asleep in his cot bed, his dress and stocking hanging on a chair. In the kitchen she stopped for her lantern and her hot brick. She hurried up the back stairs and through the windy loft to her own glacial room. The illusion was marred only by the consciousness that she ought to brush her teeth before she went to bed, and that she never used to do it. Why\u2014? The water was frozen solid in the pitcher, so she got over that. Once between the red blankets there was a short, fierce battle with the cold; then, warmer\u2014warmer. She could hear her father shaking down the hard-coal burner for the night, and the wind rushing and banging down the village street. The boughs of the cottonwood, hard as bone, rattled against her gable. The bed grew softer and warmer. Everybody was warm and well downstairs. The sprawling old house had gathered them all in, like a hen, and had settled down over its brood. They were all warm in her father's house. Softer and softer. She was asleep. She slept ten hours without turning over. From sleep like that, one awakes in shining armor.", "8": "On Friday afternoon there was an inspiring audience; there was not an empty chair in the house. Ottenburg and Dr. Archie had seats in the orchestra circle, got from a ticket broker. Landry had not been able to get a seat, so he roamed about in the back of the house, where he usually stood when he dropped in after his own turn in vaudeville was over. He was there so often and at such irregular hours that the ushers thought he was a singer's husband, or had something to do with the electrical plant.", "9": "Harsanyi and his wife were in a box, near the stage, in the second circle. Mrs. Harsanyi's hair was noticeably gray, but her face was fuller and handsomer than in those early years of struggle, and she was beautifully dressed. Harsanyi himself had changed very little. He had put on his best afternoon coat in honor of his pupil, and wore a pearl in his black ascot. His hair was longer and more bushy than he used to wear it, and there was now one gray lock on the right side. He had always been an elegant figure, even when he went about in shabby clothes and was crushed with work. Before the curtain rose he was restless and nervous, and kept looking at his watch and wishing he had got a few more letters off before he left his hotel. He had not been in New York since the advent of the taxicab, and had allowed himself too much time. His wife knew that he was afraid of being disappointed this afternoon. He did not often go to the opera because the stupid things that singers did vexed him so, and it always put him in a rage if the conductor held the tempo or in any way accommodated the score to the singer.", "10": "When the lights went out and the violins began to quaver their long D against the rude figure of the basses, Mrs. Harsanyi saw her husband's fingers fluttering on his knee in a rapid tattoo. At the moment when SIEGLINDE entered from the side door, she leaned toward him and whispered in his ear, \u201cOh, the lovely creature!\u201d But he made no response, either by voice or gesture. Throughout the first scene he sat sunk in his chair, his head forward and his one yellow eye rolling restlessly and shining like a tiger's in the dark. His eye followed SIEGLINDE about the stage like a satellite, and as she sat at the table listening to SIEGMUND'S long narrative, it never left her. When she prepared the sleeping draught and disappeared after HUNDING, Harsanyi bowed his head still lower and put his hand over his eye to rest it.

WO IST DEIN SCHWERT?\u201d", "12": "Harsanyi smiled, but he did not look forth again until SIEGLINDE reappeared.

Into one lovely attitude after another the music swept her, love impelled her. And the voice gave out all that was best in it. Like the spring, indeed, it blossomed into memories and prophecies, it recounted and it foretold, as she sang the story of her friendless life, and of how the thing which was truly herself, \u201cbright as the day, rose to the surface\u201d when in the hostile world she for the first time beheld her Friend. Fervently she rose into the hardier feeling of action and daring, the pride in hero-strength and hero-blood, until in a splendid burst, tall and shining like a Victory, she christened him:\u2014", "19": "\u201cSIEGMUND\u2014SO NENN ICH DICH!\u201d", "20": "Her impatience for the sword swelled with her anticipation of his act, and throwing her arms above her head, she fairly tore a sword out of the empty air for him, before NOTHUNG had left the tree.

Enough voice and talent and beauty, enough physical power. And such a noble, noble style!\u201d", "22": "\u201cI can scarcely believe it, Andor. I can see her now, that clumsy girl, hunched up over your piano. I can see her shoulders. She always seemed to labor so with her back. And I shall never forget that night when you found her voice.\u201d", "23": "The audience kept up its clamor until, after many reappearances with the tenor, Kronborg came before the curtain alone. The house met her with a roar, a greeting that was almost savage in its fierceness. The singer's eyes, sweeping the house, rested for a moment on Harsanyi, and she waved her long sleeve toward his box.", "24": "\u201cShe OUGHT to be pleased that you are here,\u201d said Mrs. Harsanyi. \u201cI wonder if she knows how much she owes to you.\u201d", "25": "\u201cShe owes me nothing,\u201d replied her husband quickly. \u201cShe paid her way. She always gave something back, even then.\u201d", "26": "\u201cI remember you said once that she would do nothing common,\u201d said Mrs. Harsanyi thoughtfully.", "27": "\u201cJust so. She might fail, die, get lost in the pack. But if she achieved, it would be nothing common. There are people whom one can trust for that. There is one way in which they will never fail.\u201d Harsanyi retired into his own reflections.", "28": "After the second act Fred Ottenburg brought Archie to the Harsanyis' box and introduced him as an old friend of Miss Kronborg. The head of a musical publishing house joined them, bringing with him a journalist and the president of a German singing society. The conversation was chiefly about the new SIEGLINDE. Mrs. Harsanyi was gracious and enthusiastic, her husband nervous and uncommunicative. He smiled mechanically, and politely answered questions addressed to him. \u201cYes, quite so.\u201d \u201cOh, certainly.\u201d Every one, of course, said very usual things with great conviction. Mrs. Harsanyi was used to hearing and uttering the commonplaces which such occasions demanded. When her husband withdrew into the shadow, she covered his retreat by her sympathy and cordiality. In reply to a direct question from Ottenburg, Harsanyi said, flinching, \u201cISOLDE? Yes, why not?

The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is. That afternoon nothing new came to Thea Kronborg, no enlightenment, no inspiration. She merely came into full possession of things she had been refining and perfecting for so long. Her inhibitions chanced to be fewer than usual, and, within herself, she entered into the inheritance that she herself had laid up, into the fullness of the faith she had kept before she knew its name or its meaning.", "35": "Often when she sang, the best she had was unavailable; she could not break through to it, and every sort of distraction and mischance came between it and her. But this afternoon the closed roads opened, the gates dropped. What she had so often tried to reach, lay under her hand. She had only to touch an idea to make it live.", "36": "While she was on the stage she was conscious that every movement was the right movement, that her body was absolutely the instrument of her idea. Not for nothing had she kept it so severely, kept it filled with such energy and fire. All that deep-rooted vitality flowered in her voice, her face, in her very finger-tips. She felt like a tree bursting into bloom. And her voice was as flexible as her body; equal to any demand, capable of every NUANCE. With the sense of its perfect companionship, its entire trustworthiness, she had been able to throw herself into the dramatic exigencies of the part, everything in her at its best and everything working together.", "37": "The third act came on, and the afternoon slipped by. Thea Kronborg's friends, old and new, seated about the house on different floors and levels, enjoyed her triumph according to their natures. There was one there, whom nobody knew, who perhaps got greater pleasure out of that afternoon than Harsanyi himself. Up in the top gallery a gray-haired little Mexican, withered and bright as a string of peppers beside a'dobe door, kept praying and cursing under his breath, beating on the brass railing and shouting \u201cBravo! Bravo!\u201d until he was repressed by his neighbors.", "38": "He happened to be there because a Mexican band was to be a feature of Barnum and Bailey's circus that year. One of the managers of the show had traveled about the Southwest, signing up a lot of Mexican musicians at low wages, and had brought them to New York. Among them was Spanish Johnny. After Mrs. Tellamantez died, Johnny abandoned his trade and went out with his mandolin to pick up a living for one. His irregularities had become his regular mode of life.", "39": "When Thea Kronborg came out of the stage entrance on Fortieth Street, the sky was still flaming with the last rays of the sun that was sinking off behind the North River. A little crowd of people was lingering about the door\u2014musicians from the orchestra who were waiting for their comrades, curious young men, and some poorly dressed girls who were hoping to get a glimpse of the singer. She bowed graciously to the group, through her veil, but she did not look to the right or left as she crossed the sidewalk to her cab. Had she lifted her eyes an instant and glanced out through her white scarf, she must have seen the only man in the crowd who had removed his hat when she emerged, and who stood with it crushed up in his hand. And she would have known him, changed as he was. His lustrous black hair was full of gray, and his face was a good deal worn by the EXTASI, so that it seemed to have shrunk away from his shining eyes and teeth and left them too prominent. But she would have known him. She passed so near that he could have touched her, and he did not put on his hat until her taxi had snorted away. Then he walked down Broadway with his hands in his overcoat pockets, wearing a smile which embraced all the stream of life that passed him and the lighted towers that rose into the limpid blue of the evening sky. If the singer, going home exhausted in her cab, was wondering what was the good of it all, that smile, could she have seen it, would have answered her. It is the only commensurate answer.", "40": "Here we must leave Thea Kronborg. From this time on the story of her life is the story of her achievement. The growth of an artist is an intellectual and spiritual development which can scarcely be followed in a personal narrative. This story attempts to deal only with the simple and concrete beginnings which color and accent an artist's work, and to give some account of how a Moonstone girl found her way out of a vague, easy-going world into a life of disciplined endeavor. Any account of the loyalty of young hearts to some exalted ideal, and the passion with which they strive, will always, in some of us, rekindle generous emotions."}, "XII": {"0": "One July night, when the moon was full, Dr. Archie was coming up from the depot, restless and discontented, wishing there were something to do. He carried his straw hat in his hand, and kept brushing his hair back from his forehead with a purposeless, unsatisfied gesture. After he passed Uncle Billy Beemer's cottonwood grove, the sidewalk ran out of the shadow into the white moonlight and crossed the sand gully on high posts, like a bridge. As the doctor approached this trestle, he saw a white figure, and recognized Thea Kronborg. He quickened his pace and she came to meet him.", "1": "\u201cWhat are you doing out so late, my girl?\u201d he asked as he took her hand.", "2": "\u201cOh, I don't know. What do people go to bed so early for? I'd like to run along before the houses and screech at them. Isn't it glorious out here?\u201d", "3": "The young doctor gave a melancholy laugh and pressed her hand.", "4": "\u201cThink of it,\u201d Thea snorted impatiently. \u201cNobody up but us and the rabbits! I've started up half a dozen of 'em. Look at that little one down there now,\u201d\u2014she stooped and pointed. In the gully below them there was, indeed, a little rabbit with a white spot of a tail, crouching down on the sand, quite motionless. It seemed to be lapping up the moonlight like cream. On the other side of the walk, down in the ditch, there was a patch of tall, rank sunflowers, their shaggy leaves white with dust. The moon stood over the cottonwood grove. There was no wind, and no sound but the wheezing of an engine down on the tracks.", "5": "\u201cWell, we may as well watch the rabbits.\u201d Dr. Archie sat down on the sidewalk and let his feet hang over the edge. He pulled out a smooth linen handkerchief that smelled of German cologne water. \u201cWell, how goes it? Working hard? You must know about all Wunsch can teach you by this time.\u201d", "6": "Thea shook her head. \u201cOh, no, I don't, Dr. Archie. He's hard to get at, but he's been a real musician in his time. Mother says she believes he's forgotten more than the music-teachers down in Denver ever knew.\u201d", "7": "\u201cI'm afraid he won't be around here much longer,\u201d said Dr. Archie. \u201cHe's been making a tank of himself lately. He'll be pulling his freight one of these days. That's the way they do, you know. I'll be sorry on your account.\u201d He paused and ran his fresh handkerchief over his face. \u201cWhat the deuce are we all here for anyway, Thea?\u201d he said abruptly.", "8": "\u201cOn earth, you mean?\u201d Thea asked in a low voice.", "9": "\u201cWell, primarily, yes. But secondarily, why are we in Moonstone? It isn't as if we'd been born here. You were, but Wunsch wasn't, and I wasn't. I suppose I'm here because I married as soon as I got out of medical school and had to get a practice quick. If you hurry things, you always get left in the end. I don't learn anything here, and as for the people\u2014In my own town in Michigan, now, there were people who liked me on my father's account, who had even known my grandfather. That meant something. But here it's all like the sand: blows north one day and south the next. We're all a lot of gamblers without much nerve, playing for small stakes. The railroad is the one real fact in this country. That has to be; the world has to be got back and forth. But the rest of us are here just because it's the end of a run and the engine has to have a drink. Some day I'll get up and find my hair turning gray, and I'll have nothing to show for it.\u201d", "10": "Thea slid closer to him and caught his arm. \u201cNo, no. I won't let you get gray. You've got to stay young for me. I'm getting young now, too.\u201d", "11": "Archie laughed. \u201cGetting?\u201d", "12": "\u201cYes. People aren't young when they're children. Look at Thor, now; he's just a little old man. But Gus has a sweetheart, and he's young!\u201d", "13": "\u201cSomething in that!\u201d Dr. Archie patted her head, and then felt the shape of her skull gently, with the tips of his fingers. \u201cWhen you were little, Thea, I used always to be curious about the shape of your head. You seemed to have more inside it than most youngsters. I haven't examined it for a long time. Seems to be the usual shape, but uncommonly hard, some how. What are you going to do with yourself, anyway?\u201d", "14": "\u201cI don't know.\u201d", "15": "\u201cHonest, now?\u201d He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes.", "16": "Thea laughed and edged away from him.", "17": "\u201cYou've got something up your sleeve, haven't you? Anything you like; only don't marry and settle down here without giving yourself a chance, will you?\u201d", "18": "\u201cNot much. See, there's another rabbit!\u201d", "19": "\u201cThat's all right about the rabbits, but I don't want you to get tied up. Remember that.\u201d", "20": "Thea nodded. \u201cBe nice to Wunsch, then. I don't know what I'd do if he went away.\u201d", "21": "\u201cYou've got older friends than Wunsch here, Thea.\u201d", "22": "\u201cI know.\u201d Thea spoke seriously and looked up at the moon, propping her chin on her hand. \u201cBut Wunsch is the only one that can teach me what I want to know. I've got to learn to do something well, and that's the thing I can do best.\u201d", "23": "\u201cDo you want to be a music-teacher?\u201d", "24": "\u201cMaybe, but I want to be a good one. I'd like to go to Germany to study, some day. Wunsch says that's the best place,\u2014the only place you can really learn.\u201d Thea hesitated and then went on nervously, \u201cI've got a book that says so, too. It's called 'My Musical Memories.' It made me want to go to Germany even before Wunsch said anything. Of course it's a secret. You're the first one I've told.\u201d", "25": "Dr. Archie smiled indulgently. \u201cThat's a long way off. Is that what you've got in your hard noddle?\u201d He put his hand on her hair, but this time she shook him off.", "26": "\u201cNo, I don't think much about it. But you talk about going, and a body has to have something to go TO!\u201d", "27": "\u201cThat's so.\u201d Dr. Archie sighed. \u201cYou're lucky if you have. Poor Wunsch, now, he hasn't. What do such fellows come out here for? He's been asking me about my mining stock, and about mining towns. What would he do in a mining town? He wouldn't know a piece of ore if he saw one. He's got nothing to sell that a mining town wants to buy. Why don't those old fellows stay at home? We won't need them for another hundred years. An engine wiper can get a job, but a piano player! Such people can't make good.\u201d", "28": "\u201cMy grandfather Alstrom was a musician, and he made good.\u201d", "29": "Dr. Archie chuckled. \u201cOh, a Swede can make good anywhere, at anything! You've got that in your favor, miss. Come, you must be getting home.\u201d", "30": "Thea rose. \u201cYes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but I'm not any more. Swedes are kind of common, but I think it's better to be SOMETHING.\u201d", "31": "\u201cIt surely is! How tall you are getting. You come above my shoulder now.\u201d", "32": "\u201cI'll keep on growing, don't you think? I particularly want to be tall. Yes, I guess I must go home. I wish there'd be a fire.\u201d", "33": "\u201cA fire?\u201d", "34": "\u201cYes, so the fire-bell would ring and the roundhouse whistle would blow, and everybody would come running out. Sometime I'm going to ring the fire-bell myself and stir them all up.\u201d", "35": "\u201cYou'd be arrested.\u201d", "36": "\u201cWell, that would be better than going to bed.\u201d", "37": "\u201cI'll have to lend you some more books.\u201d", "38": "Thea shook herself impatiently. \u201cI can't read every night.\u201d", "39": "Dr. Archie gave one of his low, sympathetic chuckles as he opened the gate for her. \u201cYou're beginning to grow up, that's what's the matter with you. I'll have to keep an eye on you. Now you'll have to say good-night to the moon.\u201d", "40": "\u201cNo, I won't. I sleep on the floor now, right in the moonlight. My window comes down to the floor, and I can look at the sky all night.\u201d", "41": "She shot round the house to the kitchen door, and Dr. Archie watched her disappear with a sigh. He thought of the hard, mean, frizzy little woman who kept his house for him; once the belle of a Michigan town, now dry and withered up at thirty. \u201cIf I had a daughter like Thea to watch,\u201d he reflected, \u201cI wouldn't mind anything. I wonder if all of my life's going to be a mistake just because I made a big one then? Hardly seems fair.\u201d", "42": "Howard Archie was \u201crespected\u201d rather than popular in Moonstone. Everyone recognized that he was a good physician, and a progressive Western town likes to be able to point to a handsome, well-set-up, well-dressed man among its citizens. But a great many people thought Archie \u201cdistant,\u201d and they were right. He had the uneasy manner of a man who is not among his own kind, and who has not seen enough of the world to feel that all people are in some sense his own kind. He knew that every one was curious about his wife, that she played a sort of character part in Moonstone, and that people made fun of her, not very delicately. Her own friends\u2014most of them women who were distasteful to Archie\u2014liked to ask her to contribute to church charities, just to see how mean she could be. The little, lop-sided cake at the church supper, the cheapest pincushion, the skimpiest apron at the bazaar, were always Mrs. Archie's contribution.", "43": "All this hurt the doctor's pride. But if there was one thing he had learned, it was that there was no changing Belle's nature. He had married a mean woman; and he must accept the consequences. Even in Colorado he would have had no pretext for divorce, and, to do him justice, he had never thought of such a thing. The tenets of the Presbyterian Church in which he had grown up, though he had long ceased to believe in them, still influenced his conduct and his conception of propriety. To him there was something vulgar about divorce. A divorced man was a disgraced man; at least, he had exhibited his hurt, and made it a matter for common gossip. Respectability was so necessary to Archie that he was willing to pay a high price for it. As long as he could keep up a decent exterior, he could manage to get on; and if he could have concealed his wife's littleness from all his friends, he would scarcely have complained. He was more afraid of pity than he was of any unhappiness. Had there been another woman for whom he cared greatly, he might have had plenty of courage; but he was not likely to meet such a woman in Moonstone.", "44": "There was a puzzling timidity in Archie's make-up. The thing that held his shoulders stiff, that made him resort to a mirthless little laugh when he was talking to dull people, that made him sometimes stumble over rugs and carpets, had its counterpart in his mind. He had not the courage to be an honest thinker. He could comfort himself by evasions and compromises. He consoled himself for his own marriage by telling himself that other people's were not much better. In his work he saw pretty deeply into marital relations in Moonstone, and he could honestly say that there were not many of his friends whom he envied. Their wives seemed to suit them well enough, but they would never have suited him.", "45": "Although Dr. Archie could not bring himself to regard marriage merely as a social contract, but looked upon it as somehow made sacred by a church in which he did not believe,\u2014as a physician he knew that a young man whose marriage is merely nominal must yet go on living his life. When he went to Denver or to Chicago, he drifted about in careless company where gayety and good-humor can be bought, not because he had any taste for such society, but because he honestly believed that anything was better than divorce. He often told himself that \u201changing and wiving go by destiny.\u201d If wiving went badly with a man,\u2014and it did oftener than not,\u2014then he must do the best he could to keep up appearances and help the tradition of domestic happiness along. The Moonstone gossips, assembled in Mrs. Smiley's millinery and notion store, often discussed Dr. Archie's politeness to his wife, and his pleasant manner of speaking about her. \u201cNobody has ever got a thing out of him yet,\u201d they agreed. And it was certainly not because no one had ever tried.", "46": "When he was down in Denver, feeling a little jolly, Archie could forget how unhappy he was at home, and could even make himself believe that he missed his wife. He always bought her presents, and would have liked to send her flowers if she had not repeatedly told him never to send her anything but bulbs,\u2014which did not appeal to him in his expansive moments. At the Denver Athletic Club banquets, or at dinner with his colleagues at the Brown Palace Hotel, he sometimes spoke sentimentally about \u201clittle Mrs. Archie,\u201d and he always drank the toast \u201cto our wives, God bless them!\u201d with gusto.", "47": "The determining factor about Dr. Archie was that he was romantic. He had married Belle White because he was romantic\u2014too romantic to know anything about women, except what he wished them to be, or to repulse a pretty girl who had set her cap for him. At medical school, though he was a rather wild boy in behavior, he had always disliked coarse jokes and vulgar stories. In his old Flint's Physiology there was still a poem he had pasted there when he was a student; some verses by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes about the ideals of the medical profession. After so much and such disillusioning experience with it, he still had a romantic feeling about the human body; a sense that finer things dwelt in it than could be explained by anatomy. He never jested about birth or death or marriage, and did not like to hear other doctors do it. He was a good nurse, and had a reverence for the bodies of women and children. When he was tending them, one saw him at his best. Then his constraint and self-consciousness fell away from him. He was easy, gentle, competent, master of himself and of other people. Then the idealist in him was not afraid of being discovered and ridiculed.", "48": "In his tastes, too, the doctor was romantic. Though he read Balzac all the year through, he still enjoyed the Waverley Novels as much as when he had first come upon them, in thick leather-bound volumes, in his grandfather's library. He nearly always read Scott on Christmas and holidays, because it brought back the pleasures of his boyhood so vividly. He liked Scott's women. Constance de Beverley and the minstrel girl in \u201cThe Fair Maid of Perth,\u201d not the Duchesse de Langeais, were his heroines. But better than anything that ever got from the heart of a man into printer's ink, he loved the poetry of Robert Burns. \u201cDeath and Dr. Hornbook\u201d and \u201cThe Jolly Beggars,\u201d Burns's \u201cReply to his Tailor,\u201d he often read aloud to himself in his office, late at night, after a glass of hot toddy. He used to read \u201cTam o'Shanter\u201d to Thea Kronborg, and he got her some of the songs, set to the old airs for which they were written. He loved to hear her sing them. Sometimes when she sang, \u201cOh, wert thou in the cauld blast,\u201d the doctor and even Mr. Kronborg joined in. Thea never minded if people could not sing; she directed them with her head and somehow carried them along. When her father got off the pitch she let her own voice out and covered him."}, "XIII": {"0": "At the beginning of June, when school closed, Thea had told Wunsch that she didn't know how much practicing she could get in this summer because Thor had his worst teeth still to cut.", "1": "\u201cMy God! all last summer he was doing that!\u201d Wunsch exclaimed furiously.", "2": "\u201cI know, but it takes them two years, and Thor is slow,\u201d Thea answered reprovingly.", "3": "The summer went well beyond her hopes, however. She told herself that it was the best summer of her life, so far. Nobody was sick at home, and her lessons were uninterrupted. Now that she had four pupils of her own and made a dollar a week, her practicing was regarded more seriously by the household. Her mother had always arranged things so that she could have the parlor four hours a day in summer. Thor proved a friendly ally. He behaved handsomely about his molars, and never objected to being pulled off into remote places in his cart. When Thea dragged him over the hill and made a camp under the shade of a bush or a bank, he would waddle about and play with his blocks, or bury his monkey in the sand and dig him up again. Sometimes he got into the cactus and set up a howl, but usually he let his sister read peacefully, while he coated his hands and face, first with an all-day sucker and then with gravel.", "4": "Life was pleasant and uneventful until the first of September, when Wunsch began to drink so hard that he was unable to appear when Thea went to take her mid-week lesson, and Mrs. Kohler had to send her home after a tearful apology. On Saturday morning she set out for the Kohlers' again, but on her way, when she was crossing the ravine, she noticed a woman sitting at the bottom of the gulch, under the railroad trestle. She turned from her path and saw that it was Mrs. Tellamantez, and she seemed to be doing drawn-work. Then Thea noticed that there was something beside her, covered up with a purple and yellow Mexican blanket. She ran up the gulch and called to Mrs. Tellamantez. The Mexican woman held up a warning finger. Thea glanced at the blanket and recognized a square red hand which protruded. The middle finger twitched slightly.", "5": "\u201cIs he hurt?\u201d she gasped.", "6": "Mrs. Tellamantez shook her head. \u201cNo; very sick. He knows nothing,\u201d she said quietly, folding her hands over her drawn-work.", "7": "Thea learned that Wunsch had been out all night, that this morning Mrs. Kohler had gone to look for him and found him under the trestle covered with dirt and cinders. Probably he had been trying to get home and had lost his way. Mrs. Tellamantez was watching beside the unconscious man while Mrs. Kohler and Johnny went to get help.", "8": "\u201cYou better go home now, I think,\u201d said Mrs. Tellamantez, in closing her narration.", "9": "Thea hung her head and looked wistfully toward the blanket.", "10": "\u201cCouldn't I just stay till they come?\u201d she asked. \u201cI'd like to know if he's very bad.\u201d", "11": "\u201cBad enough,\u201d sighed Mrs. Tellamantez, taking up her work again.", "12": "Thea sat down under the narrow shade of one of the trestle posts and listened to the locusts rasping in the hot sand while she watched Mrs. Tellamantez evenly draw her threads. The blanket looked as if it were over a heap of bricks.", "13": "\u201cI don't see him breathing any,\u201d she said anxiously.", "14": "\u201cYes, he breathes,\u201d said Mrs. Tellamantez, not lifting her eyes.", "15": "It seemed to Thea that they waited for hours. At last they heard voices, and a party of men came down the hill and up the gulch. Dr. Archie and Fritz Kohler came first; behind were Johnny and Ray, and several men from the roundhouse. Ray had the canvas litter that was kept at the depot for accidents on the road. Behind them trailed half a dozen boys who had been hanging round the depot.", "16": "When Ray saw Thea, he dropped his canvas roll and hurried forward. \u201cBetter run along home, Thee. This is ugly business.\u201d Ray was indignant that anybody who gave Thea music lessons should behave in such a manner.", "17": "Thea resented both his proprietary tone and his superior virtue. \u201cI won't. I want to know how bad he is. I'm not a baby!\u201d she exclaimed indignantly, stamping her foot into the sand.", "18": "Dr. Archie, who had been kneeling by the blanket, got up and came toward Thea, dusting his knees. He smiled and nodded confidentially. \u201cHe'll be all right when we get him home. But he wouldn't want you to see him like this, poor old chap! Understand? Now, skip!\u201d", "19": "Thea ran down the gulch and looked back only once, to see them lifting the canvas litter with Wunsch upon it, still covered with the blanket.", "20": "The men carried Wunsch up the hill and down the road to the Kohlers'. Mrs. Kohler had gone home and made up a bed in the sitting-room, as she knew the litter could not be got round the turn in the narrow stairway. Wunsch was like a dead man. He lay unconscious all day. Ray Kennedy stayed with him till two o'clock in the afternoon, when he had to go out on his run. It was the first time he had ever been inside the Kohlers' house, and he was so much impressed by Napoleon that the piece-picture formed a new bond between him and Thea.", "21": "Dr. Archie went back at six o'clock, and found Mrs. Kohler and Spanish Johnny with Wunsch, who was in a high fever, muttering and groaning.", "22": "\u201cThere ought to be some one here to look after him to-night, Mrs. Kohler,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm on a confinement case, and I can't be here, but there ought to be somebody. He may get violent.\u201d", "23": "Mrs. Kohler insisted that she could always do anything with Wunsch, but the doctor shook his head and Spanish Johnny grinned. He said he would stay. The doctor laughed at him. \u201cTen fellows like you couldn't hold him, Spanish, if he got obstreperous; an Irishman would have his hands full. Guess I'd better put the soft pedal on him.\u201d He pulled out his hypodermic.", "24": "Spanish Johnny stayed, however, and the Kohlers went to bed. At about two o'clock in the morning Wunsch rose from his ignominious cot. Johnny, who was dozing on the lounge, awoke to find the German standing in the middle of the room in his undershirt and drawers, his arms bare, his heavy body seeming twice its natural girth. His face was snarling and savage, and his eyes were crazy. He had risen to avenge himself, to wipe out his shame, to destroy his enemy. One look was enough for Johnny. Wunsch raised a chair threateningly, and Johnny, with the lightness of a PICADOR, darted under the missile and out of the open window. He shot across the gully to get help, meanwhile leaving the Kohlers to their fate.", "25": "Fritz, upstairs, heard the chair crash upon the stove. Then he heard doors opening and shutting, and some one stumbling about in the shrubbery of the garden. He and Paulina sat up in bed and held a consultation. Fritz slipped from under the covers, and going cautiously over to the window, poked out his head. Then he rushed to the door and bolted it.", "26": "\u201cMEIN GOTT, Paulina,\u201d he gasped, \u201che has the axe, he will kill us!\u201d", "27": "\u201cThe dresser,\u201d cried Mrs. Kohler; \u201cpush the dresser before the door. ACH, if you had your rabbit gun, now!\u201d", "28": "\u201cIt is in the barn,\u201d said Fritz sadly. \u201cIt would do no good; he would not be afraid of anything now. Stay you in the bed, Paulina.\u201d The dresser had lost its casters years ago, but he managed to drag it in front of the door. \u201cHe is in the garden. He makes nothing. He will get sick again, may-be.\u201d", "29": "Fritz went back to bed and his wife pulled the quilt over him and made him lie down. They heard stumbling in the garden again, then a smash of glass.", "30": "\u201cACH, DAS MISTBEET!\u201d gasped Paulina, hearing her hotbed shivered. \u201cThe poor soul, Fritz, he will cut himself. ACH! what is that?\u201d They both sat up in bed. \u201cWIEDER! ACH, What is he doing?\u201d", "31": "The noise came steadily, a sound of chopping. Paulina tore off her night-cap. \u201cDIE BAUME, DIE BAUME! He is cutting our trees, Fritz!\u201d Before her husband could prevent her, she had sprung from the bed and rushed to the window. \u201cDER TAUBENSCHLAG! GERECHTER HIMMEL, he is chopping the dove-house down!\u201d", "32": "Fritz reached her side before she had got her breath again, and poked his head out beside hers. There, in the faint starlight, they saw a bulky man, barefoot, half dressed, chopping away at the white post that formed the pedestal of the dove-house. The startled pigeons were croaking and flying about his head, even beating their wings in his face, so that he struck at them furiously with the axe. In a few seconds there was a crash, and Wunsch had actually felled the dove-house.", "33": "\u201cOh, if only it is not the trees next!\u201d prayed Paulina. \u201cThe dove-house you can make new again, but not DIE BAUME.\u201d", "34": "They watched breathlessly. In the garden below Wunsch stood in the attitude of a woodman, contemplating the fallen cote. Suddenly he threw the axe over his shoulder and went out of the front gate toward the town.", "35": "\u201cThe poor soul, he will meet his death!\u201d Mrs. Kohler wailed. She ran back to her feather bed and hid her face in the pillow.", "36": "Fritz kept watch at the window. \u201cNo, no, Paulina,\u201d he called presently; \u201cI see lanterns coming. Johnny must have gone for somebody. Yes, four lanterns, coming along the gulch. They stop; they must have seen him already. Now they are under the hill and I cannot see them, but I think they have him. They will bring him back. I must dress and go down.\u201d He caught his trousers and began pulling them on by the window. \u201cYes, here they come, half a dozen men. And they have tied him with a rope, Paulina!\u201d", "37": "\u201cACH, the poor man! To be led like a cow,\u201d groaned Mrs. Kohler. \u201cOh, it is good that he has no wife!\u201d She was reproaching herself for nagging Fritz when he drank himself into foolish pleasantry or mild sulks, and felt that she had never before appreciated her blessings.", "38": "Wunsch was in bed for ten days, during which time he was gossiped about and even preached about in Moonstone. The Baptist preacher took a shot at the fallen man from his pulpit, Mrs. Livery Johnson nodding approvingly from her pew. The mothers of Wunsch's pupils sent him notes informing him that their daughters would discontinue their music-lessons. The old maid who had rented him her piano sent the town dray for her contaminated instrument, and ever afterward declared that Wunsch had ruined its tone and scarred its glossy finish. The Kohlers were unremitting in their kindness to their friend. Mrs. Kohler made him soups and broths without stint, and Fritz repaired the dove-house and mounted it on a new post, lest it might be a sad reminder.", "39": "As soon as Wunsch was strong enough to sit about in his slippers and wadded jacket, he told Fritz to bring him some stout thread from the shop. When Fritz asked what he was going to sew, he produced the tattered score of \u201cOrpheus\u201d and said he would like to fix it up for a little present. Fritz carried it over to the shop and stitched it into pasteboards, covered with dark suiting-cloth. Over the stitches he glued a strip of thin red leather which he got from his friend, the harness-maker. After Paulina had cleaned the pages with fresh bread, Wunsch was amazed to see what a fine book he had. It opened stiffly, but that was no matter.", "40": "Nobody in Moonstone ever found what Wunsch's first name was. That \u201cA\u201d may have stood for Adam, or August, or even Amadeus; he got very angry if any one asked him.", "41": "He remained A. Wunsch to the end of his chapter there. When he presented this score to Thea, he told her that in ten years she would either know what the inscription meant, or she would not have the least idea, in which case it would not matter.", "42": "When Wunsch began to pack his trunk, both the Kohlers were very unhappy. He said he was coming back some day, but that for the present, since he had lost all his pupils, it would be better for him to try some \u201cnew town.\u201d Mrs. Kohler darned and mended all his clothes, and gave him two new shirts she had made for Fritz. Fritz made him a new pair of trousers and would have made him an overcoat but for the fact that overcoats were so easy to pawn.", "43": "Wunsch would not go across the ravine to the town until he went to take the morning train for Denver. He said that after he got to Denver he would \u201clook around.\u201d He left Moonstone one bright October morning, without telling any one good-bye. He bought his ticket and went directly into the smoking-car. When the train was beginning to pull out, he heard his name called frantically, and looking out of the window he saw Thea Kronborg standing on the siding, bareheaded and panting. Some boys had brought word to school that they saw Wunsch's trunk going over to the station, and Thea had run away from school. She was at the end of the station platform, her hair in two braids, her blue gingham dress wet to the knees because she had run across lots through the weeds. It had rained during the night, and the tall sunflowers behind her were fresh and shining.", "44": "\u201cGood-bye, Herr Wunsch, good-bye!\u201d she called waving to him.", "45": "He thrust his head out at the car window and called back, \u201cLEBEN SIE WOHL, LEBEN SIE WOHL, MEIN KIND!\u201d He watched her until the train swept around the curve beyond the roundhouse, and then sank back into his seat, muttering, \u201cShe had been running. Ah, she will run a long way; they cannot stop her!\u201d", "46": "What was it about the child that one believed in? Was it her dogged industry, so unusual in this free-and-easy country? Was it her imagination? More likely it was because she had both imagination and a stubborn will, curiously balancing and interpenetrating each other. There was something unconscious and unawakened about her, that tempted curiosity. She had a kind of seriousness that he had not met with in a pupil before. She hated difficult things, and yet she could never pass one by. They seemed to challenge her; she had no peace until she mastered them. She had the power to make a great effort, to lift a weight heavier than herself. Wunsch hoped he would always remember her as she stood by the track, looking up at him; her broad eager face, so fair in color, with its high cheek-bones, yellow eyebrows and greenishhazel eyes. It was a face full of light and energy, of the unquestioning hopefulness of first youth. Yes, she was like a flower full of sun, but not the soft German flowers of his childhood. He had it now, the comparison he had absently reached for before: she was like the yellow prickly pear blossoms that open there in the desert; thornier and sturdier than the maiden flowers he remembered; not so sweet, but wonderful.", "47": "That night Mrs. Kohler brushed away many a tear as she got supper and set the table for two. When they sat down, Fritz was more silent than usual. People who have lived long together need a third at table: they know each other's thoughts so well that they have nothing left to say. Mrs. Kohler stirred and stirred her coffee and clattered the spoon, but she had no heart for her supper. She felt, for the first time in years, that she was tired of her own cooking. She looked across the glass lamp at her husband and asked him if the butcher liked his new overcoat, and whether he had got the shoulders right in a ready-made suit he was patching over for Ray Kennedy. After supper Fritz offered to wipe the dishes for her, but she told him to go about his business, and not to act as if she were sick or getting helpless.", "48": "When her work in the kitchen was all done, she went out to cover the oleanders against frost, and to take a last look at her chickens. As she came back from the hen-house she stopped by one of the linden trees and stood resting her hand on the trunk. He would never come back, the poor man; she knew that. He would drift on from new town to new town, from catastrophe to catastrophe. He would hardly find a good home for himself again. He would die at last in some rough place, and be buried in the desert or on the wild prairie, far enough from any linden tree!", "49": "Fritz, smoking his pipe on the kitchen doorstep, watched his Paulina and guessed her thoughts. He, too, was sorry to lose his friend. But Fritz was getting old; he had lived a long while and had learned to lose without struggle."}, "XIV": {"0": "\u201cMother,\u201d said Peter Kronborg to his wife one morning about two weeks after Wunsch's departure, \u201chow would you like to drive out to Copper Hole with me to-day?\u201d", "1": "Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she would enjoy the drive. She put on her gray cashmere dress and gold watch and chain, as befitted a minister's wife, and while her husband was dressing she packed a black oilcloth satchel with such clothing as she and Thor would need overnight.", "2": "Copper Hole was a settlement fifteen miles northwest of Moonstone where Mr. Kronborg preached every Friday evening. There was a big spring there and a creek and a few irrigating ditches. It was a community of discouraged agriculturists who had disastrously experimented with dry farming. Mr. Kronborg always drove out one day and back the next, spending the night with one of his parishioners. Often, when the weather was fine, his wife accompanied him. To-day they set out from home after the midday meal, leaving Tillie in charge of the house. Mrs. Kronborg's maternal feeling was always garnered up in the baby, whoever the baby happened to be. If she had the baby with her, the others could look out for themselves. Thor, of course, was not, accurately speaking, a baby any longer. In the matter of nourishment he was quite independent of his mother, though this independence had not been won without a struggle. Thor was conservative in all things, and the whole family had anguished with him when he was being weaned. Being the youngest, he was still the baby for Mrs. Kronborg, though he was nearly four years old and sat up boldly on her lap this afternoon, holding on to the ends of the lines and shouting \u201c'mup, 'mup, horsey.\u201d His father watched him affectionately and hummed hymn tunes in the jovial way that was sometimes such a trial to Thea.", "3": "Mrs. Kronborg was enjoying the sunshine and the brilliant sky and all the faintly marked features of the dazzling, monotonous landscape. She had a rather unusual capacity for getting the flavor of places and of people. Although she was so enmeshed in family cares most of the time, she could emerge serene when she was away from them. For a mother of seven, she had a singularly unprejudiced point of view. She was, moreover, a fatalist, and as she did not attempt to direct things beyond her control, she found a good deal of time to enjoy the ways of man and nature.", "4": "When they were well upon their road, out where the first lean pasture lands began and the sand grass made a faint showing between the sagebrushes, Mr. Kronborg dropped his tune and turned to his wife. \u201cMother, I've been thinking about something.\u201d", "5": "\u201cI guessed you had. What is it?\u201d She shifted Thor to her left knee, where he would be more out of the way.", "6": "\u201cWell, it's about Thea. Mr. Follansbee came to my study at the church the other day and said they would like to have their two girls take lessons of Thea. Then I sounded Miss Meyers\u201d (Miss Meyers was the organist in Mr. Kronborg's church) \u201cand she said there was a good deal of talk about whether Thea wouldn't take over Wunsch's pupils. She said if Thea stopped school she wouldn't wonder if she could get pretty much all Wunsch's class. People think Thea knows about all Wunsch could teach.\u201d", "7": "Mrs. Kronborg looked thoughtful. \u201cDo you think we ought to take her out of school so young?\u201d", "8": "\u201cShe is young, but next year would be her last year anyway. She's far along for her age. And she can't learn much under the principal we've got now, can she?\u201d", "9": "\u201cNo, I'm afraid she can't,\u201d his wife admitted. \u201cShe frets a good deal and says that man always has to look in the back of the book for the answers. She hates all that diagramming they have to do, and I think myself it's a waste of time.\u201d", "10": "Mr. Kronborg settled himself back into the seat and slowed the mare to a walk. \u201cYou see, it occurs to me that we might raise Thea's prices, so it would be worth her while. Seventy-five cents for hour lessons, fifty cents for half-hour lessons. If she got, say two thirds of Wunsch's class, that would bring her in upwards of ten dollars a week. Better pay than teaching a country school, and there would be more work in vacation than in winter. Steady work twelve months in the year; that's an advantage. And she'd be living at home, with no expenses.\u201d", "11": "\u201cThere'd be talk if you raised her prices,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg dubiously.", "12": "\u201cAt first there would. But Thea is so much the best musician in town that they'd all come into line after a while. A good many people in Moonstone have been making money lately, and have bought new pianos. There were ten new pianos shipped in here from Denver in the last year. People ain't going to let them stand idle; too much money invested. I believe Thea can have as many scholars as she can handle, if we set her up a little.\u201d", "13": "\u201cHow set her up, do you mean?\u201d Mrs. Kronborg felt a certain reluctance about accepting this plan, though she had not yet had time to think out her reasons.", "14": "\u201cWell, I've been thinking for some time we could make good use of another room. We couldn't give up the parlor to her all the time. If we built another room on the ell and put the piano in there, she could give lessons all day long and it wouldn't bother us. We could build a clothes-press in it, and put in a bed-lounge and a dresser and let Anna have it for her sleeping-room. She needs a place of her own, now that she's beginning to be dressy.\u201d", "15": "\u201cSeems like Thea ought to have the choice of the room, herself,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg.", "16": "\u201cBut, my dear, she don't want it. Won't have it. I sounded her coming home from church on Sunday; asked her if she would like to sleep in a new room, if we built on. She fired up like a little wild-cat and said she'd made her own room all herself, and she didn't think anybody ought to take it away from her.\u201d", "17": "\u201cShe don't mean to be impertinent, father. She's made decided that way, like my father.\u201d Mrs. Kronborg spoke warmly. \u201cI never have any trouble with the child. I remember my father's ways and go at her carefully. Thea's all right.\u201d", "18": "Mr. Kronborg laughed indulgently and pinched Thor's full cheek. \u201cOh, I didn't mean anything against your girl, mother! She's all right, but she's a little wild-cat, just the same. I think Ray Kennedy's planning to spoil a born old maid.\u201d", "19": "\u201cHuh! She'll get something a good sight better than Ray Kennedy, you see! Thea's an awful smart girl. I've seen a good many girls take music lessons in my time, but I ain't seen one that took to it so. Wunsch said so, too. She's got the making of something in her.\u201d", "20": "\u201cI don't deny that, and the sooner she gets at it in a businesslike way, the better. She's the kind that takes responsibility, and it'll be good for her.\u201d", "21": "Mrs. Kronborg was thoughtful. \u201cIn some ways it will, maybe. But there's a good deal of strain about teaching youngsters, and she's always worked so hard with the scholars she has. I've often listened to her pounding it into 'em. I don't want to work her too hard. She's so serious that she's never had what you might call any real childhood. Seems like she ought to have the next few years sort of free and easy. She'll be tied down with responsibilities soon enough.\u201d", "22": "Mr. Kronborg patted his wife's arm. \u201cDon't you believe it, mother. Thea is not the marrying kind. I've watched 'em. Anna will marry before long and make a good wife, but I don't see Thea bringing up a family. She's got a good deal of her mother in her, but she hasn't got all. She's too peppery and too fond of having her own way. Then she's always got to be ahead in everything. That kind make good church-workers and missionaries and school teachers, but they don't make good wives. They fret all their energy away, like colts, and get cut on the wire.\u201d", "23": "Mrs. Kronborg laughed. \u201cGive me the graham crackers I put in your pocket for Thor. He's hungry. You're a funny man, Peter. A body wouldn't think, to hear you, you was talking about your own daughters. I guess you see through 'em. Still, even if Thea ain't apt to have children of her own, I don't know as that's a good reason why she should wear herself out on other people's.\u201d", "24": "\u201cThat's just the point, mother. A girl with all that energy has got to do something, same as a boy, to keep her out of mischief. If you don't want her to marry Ray, let her do something to make herself independent.\u201d", "25": "\u201cWell, I'm not against it. It might be the best thing for her. I wish I felt sure she wouldn't worry. She takes things hard. She nearly cried herself sick about Wunsch's going away. She's the smartest child of 'em all, Peter, by a long ways.\u201d", "26": "Peter Kronborg smiled. \u201cThere you go, Anna. That's you all over again. Now, I have no favorites; they all have their good points. But you,\u201d with a twinkle, \u201calways did go in for brains.\u201d", "27": "Mrs. Kronborg chuckled as she wiped the cracker crumbs from Thor's chin and fists. \u201cWell, you're mighty conceited, Peter! But I don't know as I ever regretted it. I prefer having a family of my own to fussing with other folks' children, that's the truth.\u201d", "28": "Before the Kronborgs reached Copper Hole, Thea's destiny was pretty well mapped out for her. Mr. Kronborg was always delighted to have an excuse for enlarging the house.", "29": "Mrs. Kronborg was quite right in her conjecture that there would be unfriendly comment in Moonstone when Thea raised her prices for music-lessons. People said she was getting too conceited for anything. Mrs. Livery Johnson put on a new bonnet and paid up all her back calls to have the pleasure of announcing in each parlor she entered that her daughters, at least, would \u201cnever pay professional prices to Thea Kronborg.\u201d", "30": "Thea raised no objection to quitting school. She was now in the \u201chigh room,\u201d as it was called, in next to the highest class, and was studying geometry and beginning Caesar. She no longer recited her lessons to the teacher she liked, but to the Principal, a man who belonged, like Mrs. Livery Johnson, to the camp of Thea's natural enemies. He taught school because he was too lazy to work among grown-up people, and he made an easy job of it. He got out of real work by inventing useless activities for his pupils, such as the \u201ctree-diagramming system.\u201d Thea had spent hours making trees out of \u201cThanatopsis,\u201d Hamlet's soliloquy, Cato on \u201cImmortality.\u201d She agonized under this waste of time, and was only too glad to accept her father's offer of liberty.", "31": "So Thea left school the first of November. By the first of January she had eight one-hour pupils and ten half-hour pupils, and there would be more in the summer. She spent her earnings generously. She bought a new Brussels carpet for the parlor, and a rifle for Gunner and Axel, and an imitation tiger-skin coat and cap for Thor. She enjoyed being able to add to the family possessions, and thought Thor looked quite as handsome in his spots as the rich children she had seen in Denver. Thor was most complacent in his conspicuous apparel. He could walk anywhere by this time\u2014though he always preferred to sit, or to be pulled in his cart. He was a blissfully lazy child, and had a number of long, dull plays, such as making nests for his china duck and waiting for her to lay him an egg. Thea thought him very intelligent, and she was proud that he was so big and burly. She found him restful, loved to hear him call her \u201csitter,\u201d and really liked his companionship, especially when she was tired. On Saturday, for instance, when she taught from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon, she liked to get off in a corner with Thor after supper, away from all the bathing and dressing and joking and talking that went on in the house, and ask him about his duck, or hear him tell one of his rambling stories."}, "XV": {"0": "By the time Thea's fifteenth birthday came round, she was established as a music teacher in Moonstone. The new room had been added to the house early in the spring, and Thea had been giving her lessons there since the middle of May. She liked the personal independence which was accorded her as a wage-earner. The family questioned her comings and goings very little. She could go buggy-riding with Ray Kennedy, for instance, without taking Gunner or Axel. She could go to Spanish Johnny's and sing part songs with the Mexicans, and nobody objected.", "1": "Thea was still under the first excitement of teaching, and was terribly in earnest about it. If a pupil did not get on well, she fumed and fretted. She counted until she was hoarse. She listened to scales in her sleep. Wunsch had taught only one pupil seriously, but Thea taught twenty. The duller they were, the more furiously she poked and prodded them. With the little girls she was nearly always patient, but with pupils older than herself, she sometimes lost her temper. One of her mistakes was to let herself in for a calling-down from Mrs. Livery Johnson. That lady appeared at the Kronborgs' one morning and announced that she would allow no girl to stamp her foot at her daughter Grace. She added that Thea's bad manners with the older girls were being talked about all over town, and that if her temper did not speedily improve she would lose all her advanced pupils. Thea was frightened. She felt she could never bear the disgrace, if such a thing happened. Besides, what would her father say, after he had gone to the expense of building an addition to the house? Mrs. Johnson demanded an apology to Grace. Thea said she was willing to make it. Mrs. Johnson said that hereafter, since she had taken lessons of the best piano teacher in Grinnell, Iowa, she herself would decide what pieces Grace should study. Thea readily consented to that, and Mrs. Johnson rustled away to tell a neighbor woman that Thea Kronborg could be meek enough when you went at her right.", "2": "Thea was telling Ray about this unpleasant encounter as they were driving out to the sand hills the next Sunday.", "3": "\u201cShe was stuffing you, all right, Thee,\u201d Ray reassured her. \u201cThere's no general dissatisfaction among your scholars. She just wanted to get in a knock. I talked to the piano tuner the last time he was here, and he said all the people he tuned for expressed themselves very favorably about your teaching. I wish you didn't take so much pains with them, myself.\u201d", "4": "\u201cBut I have to, Ray. They're all so dumb. They've got no ambition,\u201d Thea exclaimed irritably. \u201cJenny Smiley is the only one who isn't stupid. She can read pretty well, and she has such good hands. But she don't care a rap about it. She has no pride.\u201d", "5": "Ray's face was full of complacent satisfaction as he glanced sidewise at Thea, but she was looking off intently into the mirage, at one of those mammoth cattle that are nearly always reflected there. \u201cDo you find it easier to teach in your new room?\u201d he asked.", "6": "\u201cYes; I'm not interrupted so much. Of course, if I ever happen to want to practice at night, that's always the night Anna chooses to go to bed early.\u201d", "7": "\u201cIt's a darned shame, Thee, you didn't cop that room for yourself. I'm sore at the PADRE about that. He ought to give you that room. You could fix it up so pretty.\u201d", "8": "\u201cI didn't want it, honest I didn't. Father would have let me have it. I like my own room better. Somehow I can think better in a little room.

I brought something to show you. Look here, it came on my birthday. Wasn't it nice of him to remember?\u201d She took from her pocket a postcard, bent in the middle and folded, and handed it to Ray. On it was a white dove, perched on a wreath of very blue forget-me-nots, and \u201cBirthday Greetings\u201d in gold letters. Under this was written, \u201cFrom A.

I wouldn't stay there over Sunday for a ten-dollar bill.\u201d", "15": "\u201cOh, dear! What do you suppose he's doing there? Maybe he just stopped off there a few days to tune pianos,\u201d Thea suggested hopefully.", "16": "Ray gave her back the card. \u201cHe's headed in the wrong direction. What does he want to get back into a grass country for? Now, there are lots of good live towns down on the Santa Fe, and everybody down there is musical.

It wasn't because he drank they went for him; not really. It was something else.\u201d", "20": "\u201cYou want to salt your money down, Thee, and go to Chicago and take some lessons. Then you come back, and wear a long feather and high heels and put on a few airs, and that'll fix 'em. That's what they like.\u201d", "21": "\u201cI'll never have money enough to go to Chicago. Mother meant to lend me some, I think, but now they've got hard times back in Nebraska, and her farm don't bring her in anything. Takes all the tenant can raise to pay the taxes.

Ray looked his best out of doors, when his thick red hands were covered by gloves, and the dull red of his sunburned face somehow seemed right in the light and wind. He looked better, too, with his hat on; his hair was thin and dry, with no particular color or character, \u201cregular Willy-boy hair,\u201d as he himself described it. His eyes were pale beside the reddish bronze of his skin. They had the faded look often seen in the eyes of men who have lived much in the sun and wind and who have been accustomed to train their vision upon distant objects.", "23": "Ray realized that Thea's life was dull and exacting, and that she missed Wunsch. He knew she worked hard, that she put up with a great many little annoyances, and that her duties as a teacher separated her more than ever from the boys and girls of her own age. He did everything he could to provide recreation for her. He brought her candy and magazines and pineapples\u2014of which she was very fond\u2014from Denver, and kept his eyes and ears open for anything that might interest her. He was, of course, living for Thea. He had thought it all out carefully and had made up his mind just when he would speak to her. When she was seventeen, then he would tell her his plan and ask her to marry him. He would be willing to wait two, or even three years, until she was twenty, if she thought best. By that time he would surely have got in on something: copper, oil, gold, silver, sheep,\u2014something.", "24": "Meanwhile, it was pleasure enough to feel that she depended on him more and more, that she leaned upon his steady kindness. He never broke faith with himself about her; he never hinted to her of his hopes for the future, never suggested that she might be more intimately confidential with him, or talked to her of the thing he thought about so constantly. He had the chivalry which is perhaps the proudest possession of his race. He had never embarrassed her by so much as a glance. Sometimes, when they drove out to the sand hills, he let his left arm lie along the back of the buggy seat, but it never came any nearer to Thea than that, never touched her. He often turned to her a face full of pride, and frank admiration, but his glance was never so intimate or so penetrating as Dr. Archie's. His blue eyes were clear and shallow, friendly, uninquiring. He rested Thea because he was so different; because, though he often told her interesting things, he never set lively fancies going in her head; because he never misunderstood her, and because he never, by any chance, for a single instant, understood her! Yes, with Ray she was safe; by him she would never be discovered!"}, "XVI": {"0": "The pleasantest experience Thea had that summer was a trip that she and her mother made to Denver in Ray Kennedy's caboose. Mrs. Kronborg had been looking forward to this excursion for a long while, but as Ray never knew at what hour his freight would leave Moonstone, it was difficult to arrange. The call-boy was as likely to summon him to start on his run at twelve o'clock midnight as at twelve o'clock noon. The first week in June started out with all the scheduled trains running on time, and a light freight business. Tuesday evening Ray, after consulting with the dispatcher, stopped at the Kronborgs' front gate to tell Mrs. Kronborg\u2014who was helping Tillie water the flowers\u2014that if she and Thea could be at the depot at eight o'clock the next morning, he thought he could promise them a pleasant ride and get them into Denver before nine o'clock in the evening. Mrs. Kronborg told him cheerfully, across the fence, that she would \u201ctake him up on it,\u201d and Ray hurried back to the yards to scrub out his car.", "1": "The one complaint Ray's brakemen had to make of him was that he was too fussy about his caboose. His former brakeman had asked to be transferred because, he said, \u201cKennedy was as fussy about his car as an old maid about her bird-cage.\u201d Joe Giddy, who was braking with Ray now, called him \u201cthe bride,\u201d because he kept the caboose and bunks so clean.", "2": "It was properly the brakeman's business to keep the car clean, but when Ray got back to the depot, Giddy was nowhere to be found. Muttering that all his brakemen seemed to consider him \u201ceasy,\u201d Ray went down to his car alone. He built a fire in the stove and put water on to heat while he got into his overalls and jumper. Then he set to work with a scrubbing-brush and plenty of soap and \u201ccleaner.\u201d He scrubbed the floor and seats, blacked the stove, put clean sheets on the bunks, and then began to demolish Giddy's picture gallery. Ray found that his brakemen were likely to have what he termed \u201ca taste for the nude in art,\u201d and Giddy was no exception. Ray took down half a dozen girls in tights and ballet skirts,\u2014premiums for cigarette coupons,\u2014and some racy calendars advertising saloons and sporting clubs, which had cost Giddy both time and trouble; he even removed Giddy's particular pet, a naked girl lying on a couch with her knee carelessly poised in the air. Underneath the picture was printed the title, \u201cThe Odalisque.\u201d Giddy was under the happy delusion that this title meant something wicked,\u2014there was a wicked look about the consonants,\u2014but Ray, of course, had looked it up, and Giddy was indebted to the dictionary for the privilege of keeping his lady. If \u201codalisque\u201d had been what Ray called an objectionable word, he would have thrown the picture out in the first place. Ray even took down a picture of Mrs. Langtry in evening dress, because it was entitled the \u201cJersey Lily,\u201d and because there was a small head of Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, in one corner. Albert Edward's conduct was a popular subject of discussion among railroad men in those days, and as Ray pulled the tacks out of this lithograph he felt more indignant with the English than ever. He deposited all these pictures under the mattress of Giddy's bunk, and stood admiring his clean car in the lamplight; the walls now exhibited only a wheatfield, advertising agricultural implements, a map of Colorado, and some pictures of race-horses and hunting-dogs. At this moment Giddy, freshly shaved and shampooed, his shirt shining with the highest polish known to Chinese laundrymen, his straw hat tipped over his right eye, thrust his head in at the door.", "3": "\u201cWhat in hell\u2014\u201d he brought out furiously. His good humored, sunburned face seemed fairly to swell with amazement and anger.", "4": "\u201cThat's all right, Giddy,\u201d Ray called in a conciliatory tone. \u201cNothing injured. I'll put 'em all up again as I found 'em. Going to take some ladies down in the car to-morrow.\u201d", "5": "Giddy scowled. He did not dispute the propriety of Ray's measures, if there were to be ladies on board, but he felt injured. \u201cI suppose you'll expect me to behave like a Y.M.C.A. secretary,\u201d he growled. \u201cI can't do my work and serve tea at the same time.\u201d", "6": "\u201cNo need to have a tea-party,\u201d said Ray with determined cheerfulness. \u201cMrs. Kronborg will bring the lunch, and it will be a darned good one.\u201d", "7": "Giddy lounged against the car, holding his cigar between two thick fingers. \u201cThen I guess she'll get it,\u201d he observed knowingly. \u201cI don't think your musical friend is much on the grub-box. Has to keep her hands white to tickle the ivories.\u201d Giddy had nothing against Thea, but he felt cantankerous and wanted to get a rise out of Kennedy.", "8": "\u201cEvery man to his own job,\u201d Ray replied agreeably, pulling his white shirt on over his head.", "9": "Giddy emitted smoke disdainfully. \u201cI suppose so. The man that gets her will have to wear an apron and bake the pancakes. Well, some men like to mess about the kitchen.\u201d He paused, but Ray was intent on getting into his clothes as quickly as possible. Giddy thought he could go a little further. \u201cOf course, I don't dispute your right to haul women in this car if you want to; but personally, so far as I'm concerned, I'd a good deal rather drink a can of tomatoes and do without the women AND their lunch. I was never much enslaved to hard-boiled eggs, anyhow.\u201d", "10": "\u201cYou'll eat 'em to-morrow, all the same.\u201d Ray's tone had a steely glitter as he jumped out of the car, and Giddy stood aside to let him pass. He knew that Kennedy's next reply would be delivered by hand. He had once seen Ray beat up a nasty fellow for insulting a Mexican woman who helped about the grub-car in the work train, and his fists had worked like two steel hammers. Giddy wasn't looking for trouble.", "11": "At eight o'clock the next morning Ray greeted his ladies and helped them into the car. Giddy had put on a clean shirt and yellow pig-skin gloves and was whistling his best. He considered Kennedy a fluke as a ladies' man, and if there was to be a party, the honors had to be done by some one who wasn't a blacksmith at small-talk. Giddy had, as Ray sarcastically admitted, \u201ca local reputation as a jollier,\u201d and he was fluent in gallant speeches of a not too-veiled nature. He insisted that Thea should take his seat in the cupola, opposite Ray's, where she could look out over the country. Thea told him, as she clambered up, that she cared a good deal more about riding in that seat than about going to Denver. Ray was never so companionable and easy as when he sat chatting in the lookout of his little house on wheels. Good stories came to him, and interesting recollections. Thea had a great respect for the reports he had to write out, and for the telegrams that were handed to him at stations; for all the knowledge and experience it must take to run a freight train.", "12": "Giddy, down in the car, in the pauses of his work, made himself agreeable to Mrs. Kronborg.", "13": "\u201cIt's a great rest to be where my family can't get at me, Mr. Giddy,\u201d she told him. \u201cI thought you and Ray might have some housework here for me to look after, but I couldn't improve any on this car.\u201d", "14": "\u201cOh, we like to keep her neat,\u201d returned Giddy glibly, winking up at Ray's expressive back. \u201cIf you want to see a clean ice-box, look at this one. Yes, Kennedy always carries fresh cream to eat on his oatmeal. I'm not particular. The tin cow's good enough for me.\u201d", "15": "\u201cMost of you boys smoke so much that all victuals taste alike to you,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg. \u201cI've got no religious scruples against smoking, but I couldn't take as much interest cooking for a man that used tobacco. I guess it's all right for bachelors who have to eat round.\u201d", "16": "Mrs. Kronborg took off her hat and veil and made herself comfortable. She seldom had an opportunity to be idle, and she enjoyed it. She could sit for hours and watch the sage-hens fly up and the jack-rabbits dart away from the track, without being bored. She wore a tan bombazine dress, made very plainly, and carried a roomy, worn, mother-of-the-family handbag.", "17": "Ray Kennedy always insisted that Mrs. Kronborg was \u201ca fine-looking lady,\u201d but this was not the common opinion in Moonstone. Ray had lived long enough among the Mexicans to dislike fussiness, to feel that there was something more attractive in ease of manner than in absentminded concern about hairpins and dabs of lace. He had learned to think that the way a woman stood, moved, sat in her chair, looked at you, was more important than the absence of wrinkles from her skirt. Ray had, indeed, such unusual perceptions in some directions, that one could not help wondering what he would have been if he had ever, as he said, had \u201chalf a chance.\u201d", "18": "He was right; Mrs. Kronborg was a fine-looking woman. She was short and square, but her head was a real head, not a mere jerky termination of the body. It had some individuality apart from hats and hairpins. Her hair, Moonstone women admitted, would have been very pretty \u201con anybody else.\u201d Frizzy bangs were worn then, but Mrs. Kronborg always dressed her hair in the same way, parted in the middle, brushed smoothly back from her low, white forehead, pinned loosely on the back of her head in two thick braids. It was growing gray about the temples, but after the manner of yellow hair it seemed only to have grown paler there, and had taken on a color like that of English primroses. Her eyes were clear and untroubled; her face smooth and calm, and, as Ray said, \u201cstrong.\u201d", "19": "Thea and Ray, up in the sunny cupola, were laughing and talking. Ray got great pleasure out of seeing her face there in the little box where he so often imagined it. They were crossing a plateau where great red sandstone boulders lay about, most of them much wider at the top than at the base, so that they looked like great toadstools.", "20": "\u201cThe sand has been blowing against them for a good many hundred years,\u201d Ray explained, directing Thea's eyes with his gloved hand. \u201cYou see the sand blows low, being so heavy, and cuts them out underneath. Wind and sand are pretty high-class architects. That's the principle of most of the Cliff-Dweller remains down at Canyon de Chelly. The sandstorms had dug out big depressions in the face of a cliff, and the Indians built their houses back in that depression.\u201d", "21": "\u201cYou told me that before, Ray, and of course you know. But the geography says their houses were cut out of the face of the living rock, and I like that better.\u201d", "22": "Ray sniffed. \u201cWhat nonsense does get printed! It's enough to give a man disrespect for learning. How could them Indians cut houses out of the living rock, when they knew nothing about the art of forging metals?\u201d Ray leaned back in his chair, swung his foot, and looked thoughtful and happy. He was in one of his favorite fields of speculation, and nothing gave him more pleasure than talking these things over with Thea Kronborg. \u201cI'll tell you, Thee, if those old fellows had learned to work metals once, your ancient Egyptians and Assyrians wouldn't have beat them very much. Whatever they did do, they did well. Their masonry's standing there to-day, the corners as true as the Denver Capitol. They were clever at most everything but metals; and that one failure kept them from getting across. It was the quicksand that swallowed 'em up, as a race. I guess civilization proper began when men mastered metals.\u201d", "23": "Ray was not vain about his bookish phrases. He did not use them to show off, but because they seemed to him more adequate than colloquial speech. He felt strongly about these things, and groped for words, as he said, \u201cto express himself.\u201d He had the lamentable American belief that \u201cexpression\u201d is obligatory. He still carried in his trunk, among the unrelated possessions of a railroad man, a notebook on the title-page of which was written \u201cImpressions on First Viewing the Grand Canyon, Ray H. Kennedy.\u201d The pages of that book were like a battlefield; the laboring author had fallen back from metaphor after metaphor, abandoned position after position. He would have admitted that the art of forging metals was nothing to this treacherous business of recording impressions, in which the material you were so full of vanished mysteriously under your striving hand. \u201cEscaping steam!\u201d he had said to himself, the last time he tried to read that notebook.", "24": "Thea didn't mind Ray's travel-lecture expressions. She dodged them, unconsciously, as she did her father's professional palaver. The light in Ray's pale-blue eyes and the feeling in his voice more than made up for the stiffness of his language.", "25": "\u201cWere the Cliff-Dwellers really clever with their hands, Ray, or do you always have to make allowance and say, 'That was pretty good for an Indian'?\u201d she asked.", "26": "Ray went down into the car to give some instructions to Giddy. \u201cWell,\u201d he said when he returned, \u201cabout the aborigines: once or twice I've been with some fellows who were cracking burial mounds. Always felt a little ashamed of it, but we did pull out some remarkable things. We got some pottery out whole; seemed pretty fine to me. I guess their women were their artists. We found lots of old shoes and sandals made out of yucca fiber, neat and strong; and feather blankets, too.\u201d", "27": "\u201cFeather blankets? You never told me about them.\u201d", "28": "\u201cDidn't I? The old fellows\u2014or the squaws\u2014wove a close netting of yucca fiber, and then tied on little bunches of down feathers, overlapping, just the way feathers grow on a bird. Some of them were feathered on both sides. You can't get anything warmer than that, now, can you?\u2014or prettier. What I like about those old aborigines is, that they got all their ideas from nature.\u201d", "29": "Thea laughed. \u201cThat means you're going to say something about girls' wearing corsets. But some of your Indians flattened their babies' heads, and that's worse than wearing corsets.\u201d", "30": "\u201cGive me an Indian girl's figure for beauty,\u201d Ray insisted. \u201cAnd a girl with a voice like yours ought to have plenty of lung-action. But you know my sentiments on that subject. I was going to tell you about the handsomest thing we ever looted out of those burial mounds. It was on a woman, too, I regret to say. She was preserved as perfect as any mummy that ever came out of the pyramids. She had a big string of turquoises around her neck, and she was wrapped in a fox-fur cloak, lined with little yellow feathers that must have come off wild canaries. Can you beat that, now? The fellow that claimed it sold it to a Boston man for a hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d", "31": "Thea looked at him admiringly. \u201cOh, Ray, and didn't you get anything off her, to remember her by, even? She must have been a princess.\u201d", "32": "Ray took a wallet from the pocket of the coat that was hanging beside him, and drew from it a little lump wrapped in worn tissue paper. In a moment a stone, soft and blue as a robin's egg, lay in the hard palm of his hand. It was a turquoise, rubbed smooth in the Indian finish, which is so much more beautiful than the incongruous high polish the white man gives that tender stone. \u201cI got this from her necklace. See the hole where the string went through? You know how the Indians drill them? Work the drill with their teeth. You like it, don't you? They're just right for you. Blue and yellow are the Swedish colors.\u201d Ray looked intently at her head, bent over his hand, and then gave his whole attention to the track.", "33": "\u201cI'll tell you, Thee,\u201d he began after a pause, \u201cI'm going to form a camping party one of these days and persuade your PADRE to take you and your mother down to that country, and we'll live in the rock houses\u2014they're as comfortable as can be\u2014and start the cook fires up in 'em once again. I'll go into the burial mounds and get you more keepsakes than any girl ever had before.\u201d Ray had planned such an expedition for his wedding journey, and it made his heart thump to see how Thea's eyes kindled when he talked about it. \u201cI've learned more down there about what makes history,\u201d he went on, \u201cthan in all the books I've ever read. When you sit in the sun and let your heels hang out of a doorway that drops a thousand feet, ideas come to you. You begin to feel what the human race has been up against from the beginning. There's something mighty elevating about those old habitations. You feel like it's up to you to do your best, on account of those fellows having it so hard. You feel like you owed them something.\u201d", "34": "At Wassiwappa, Ray got instructions to sidetrack until Thirty-six went by. After reading the message, he turned to his guests. \u201cI'm afraid this will hold us up about two hours, Mrs. Kronborg, and we won't get into Denver till near midnight.\u201d", "35": "\u201cThat won't trouble me,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg contentedly. \u201cThey know me at the Y.W.C.A., and they'll let me in any time of night. I came to see the country, not to make time. I've always wanted to get out at this white place and look around, and now I'll have a chance. What makes it so white?\u201d", "36": "\u201cSome kind of chalky rock.\u201d Ray sprang to the ground and gave Mrs. Kronborg his hand. \u201cYou can get soil of any color in Colorado; match most any ribbon.\u201d", "37": "While Ray was getting his train on to a side track, Mrs. Kronborg strolled off to examine the post-office and station house; these, with the water tank, made up the town. The station agent \u201cbatched\u201d and raised chickens. He ran out to meet Mrs. Kronborg, clutched at her feverishly, and began telling her at once how lonely he was and what bad luck he was having with his poultry. She went to his chicken yard with him, and prescribed for gapes.", "38": "Wassiwappa seemed a dreary place enough to people who looked for verdure, a brilliant place to people who liked color. Beside the station house there was a blue-grass plot, protected by a red plank fence, and six fly-bitten box-elder trees, not much larger than bushes, were kept alive by frequent hosings from the water plug. Over the windows some dusty morning-glory vines were trained on strings. All the country about was broken up into low chalky hills, which were so intensely white, and spotted so evenly with sage, that they looked like white leopards crouching. White dust powdered everything, and the light was so intense that the station agent usually wore blue glasses. Behind the station there was a water course, which roared in flood time, and a basin in the soft white rock where a pool of alkali water flashed in the sun like a mirror. The agent looked almost as sick as his chickens, and Mrs. Kronborg at once invited him to lunch with her party. He had, he confessed, a distaste for his own cooking, and lived mainly on soda crackers and canned beef. He laughed apologetically when Mrs. Kronborg said she guessed she'd look about for a shady place to eat lunch.", "39": "She walked up the track to the water tank, and there, in the narrow shadows cast by the uprights on which the tank stood, she found two tramps. They sat up and stared at her, heavy with sleep. When she asked them where they were going, they told her \u201cto the coast.\u201d They rested by day and traveled by night; walked the ties unless they could steal a ride, they said; adding that \u201cthese Western roads were getting strict.\u201d Their faces were blistered, their eyes blood-shot, and their shoes looked fit only for the trash pile.", "40": "\u201cI suppose you're hungry?\u201d Mrs. Kronborg asked. \u201cI suppose you both drink?\u201d she went on thoughtfully, not censoriously.", "41": "The huskier of the two hoboes, a bushy, bearded fellow, rolled his eyes and said, \u201cI wonder?\u201d But the other, who was old and spare, with a sharp nose and watery eyes, sighed. \u201cSome has one affliction, some another,\u201d he said.", "42": "Mrs. Kronborg reflected. \u201cWell,\u201d she said at last, \u201cyou can't get liquor here, anyway. I am going to ask you to vacate, because I want to have a little picnic under this tank for the freight crew that brought me along. I wish I had lunch enough to provide you, but I ain't. The station agent says he gets his provisions over there at the post office store, and if you are hungry you can get some canned stuff there.\u201d She opened her handbag and gave each of the tramps a half-dollar.", "43": "The old man wiped his eyes with his forefinger. \u201cThank 'ee, ma'am. A can of tomatters will taste pretty good to me. I wasn't always walkin' ties; I had a good job in Cleveland before\u2014\u201d", "44": "The hairy tramp turned on him fiercely. \u201cAw, shut up on that, grandpaw! Ain't you got no gratitude? What do you want to hand the lady that fur?\u201d", "45": "The old man hung his head and turned away. As he went off, his comrade looked after him and said to Mrs. Kronborg: \u201cIt's true, what he says. He had a job in the car shops; but he had bad luck.\u201d They both limped away toward the store, and Mrs. Kronborg sighed. She was not afraid of tramps. She always talked to them, and never turned one away. She hated to think how many of them there were, crawling along the tracks over that vast country.", "46": "Her reflections were cut short by Ray and Giddy and Thea, who came bringing the lunch box and water bottles. Although there was not shadow enough to accommodate all the party at once, the air under the tank was distinctly cooler than the surrounding air, and the drip made a pleasant sound in that breathless noon. The station agent ate as if he had never been fed before, apologizing every time he took another piece of fried chicken. Giddy was unabashed before the devilled eggs of which he had spoken so scornfully last night. After lunch the men lit their pipes and lay back against the uprights that supported the tank.", "47": "\u201cThis is the sunny side of railroading, all right,\u201d Giddy drawled luxuriously.", "48": "\u201cYou fellows grumble too much,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg as she corked the pickle jar. \u201cYour job has its drawbacks, but it don't tie you down. Of course there's the risk; but I believe a man's watched over, and he can't be hurt on the railroad or anywhere else if it's intended he shouldn't be.\u201d", "49": "Giddy laughed. \u201cThen the trains must be operated by fellows the Lord has it in for, Mrs. Kronborg. They figure it out that a railroad man's only due to last eleven years; then it's his turn to be smashed.\u201d", "50": "\u201cThat's a dark Providence, I don't deny,\u201d Mrs. Kronborg admitted. \u201cBut there's lots of things in life that's hard to understand.\u201d", "51": "\u201cI guess!\u201d murmured Giddy, looking off at the spotted white hills.", "52": "Ray smoked in silence, watching Thea and her mother clear away the lunch. He was thinking that Mrs. Kronborg had in her face the same serious look that Thea had; only hers was calm and satisfied, and Thea's was intense and questioning. But in both it was a large kind of look, that was not all the time being broken up and convulsed by trivial things. They both carried their heads like Indian women, with a kind of noble unconsciousness. He got so tired of women who were always nodding and jerking; apologizing, deprecating, coaxing, insinuating with their heads.", "53": "When Ray's party set off again that afternoon the sun beat fiercely into the cupola, and Thea curled up in one of the seats at the back of the car and had a nap.", "54": "As the short twilight came on, Giddy took a turn in the cupola, and Ray came down and sat with Thea on the rear platform of the caboose and watched the darkness come in soft waves over the plain. They were now about thirty miles from Denver, and the mountains looked very near. The great toothed wall behind which the sun had gone down now separated into four distinct ranges, one behind the other. They were a very pale blue, a color scarcely stronger than wood smoke, and the sunset had left bright streaks in the snow-filled gorges. In the clear, yellow-streaked sky the stars were coming out, flickering like newly lighted lamps, growing steadier and more golden as the sky darkened and the land beneath them fell into complete shadow. It was a cool, restful darkness that was not black or forbidding, but somehow open and free; the night of high plains where there is no moistness or mistiness in the atmosphere.", "55": "Ray lit his pipe. \u201cI never get tired of them old stars, Thee. I miss 'em up in Washington and Oregon where it's misty. Like 'em best down in Mother Mexico, where they have everything their own way. I'm not for any country where the stars are dim.\u201d Ray paused and drew on his pipe. \u201cI don't know as I ever really noticed 'em much till that first year I herded sheep up in Wyoming. That was the year the blizzard caught me.\u201d", "56": "\u201cAnd you lost all your sheep, didn't you, Ray?\u201d Thea spoke sympathetically. \u201cWas the man who owned them nice about it?\u201d", "57": "\u201cYes, he was a good loser. But I didn't get over it for a long while. Sheep are so damned resigned. Sometimes, to this day, when I'm dog-tired, I try to save them sheep all night long. It comes kind of hard on a boy when he first finds out how little he is, and how big everything else is.\u201d", "58": "Thea moved restlessly toward him and dropped her chin on her hand, looking at a low star that seemed to rest just on the rim of the earth. \u201cI don't see how you stood it. I don't believe I could. I don't see how people can stand it to get knocked out, anyhow!\u201d She spoke with such fierceness that Ray glanced at her in surprise. She was sitting on the floor of the car, crouching like a little animal about to spring.", "59": "\u201cNo occasion for you to see,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cThere'll always be plenty of other people to take the knocks for you.\u201d", "60": "\u201cThat's nonsense, Ray.\u201d Thea spoke impatiently and leaned lower still, frowning at the red star. \u201cEverybody's up against it for himself, succeeds or fails\u2014himself.\u201d", "61": "\u201cIn one way, yes,\u201d Ray admitted, knocking the sparks from his pipe out into the soft darkness that seemed to flow like a river beside the car. \u201cBut when you look at it another way, there are a lot of halfway people in this world who help the winners win, and the failers fail. If a man stumbles, there's plenty of people to push him down. But if he's like 'the youth who bore,' those same people are foreordained to help him along. They may hate to, worse than blazes, and they may do a lot of cussin' about it, but they have to help the winners and they can't dodge it. It's a natural law, like what keeps the big clock up there going, little wheels and big, and no mix-up.\u201d Ray's hand and his pipe were suddenly outlined against the sky. \u201cEver occur to you, Thee, that they have to be on time close enough to MAKE TIME? The Dispatcher up there must have a long head.\u201d Pleased with his similitude, Ray went back to the lookout. Going into Denver, he had to keep a sharp watch.", "62": "Giddy came down, cheerful at the prospect of getting into port, and singing a new topical ditty that had come up from the Santa Fe by way of La Junta. Nobody knows who makes these songs; they seem to follow events automatically. Mrs. Kronborg made Giddy sing the whole twelve verses of this one, and laughed until she wiped her eyes. The story was that of Katie Casey, head diningroom girl at Winslow, Arizona, who was unjustly discharged by the Harvey House manager. Her suitor, the yardmaster, took the switchmen out on a strike until she was reinstated. Freight trains from the east and the west piled up at Winslow until the yards looked like a log-jam. The division superintendent, who was in California, had to wire instructions for Katie Casey's restoration before he could get his trains running. Giddy's song told all this with much detail, both tender and technical, and after each of the dozen verses came the refrain:\u2014", "63": "Thea laughed with her mother and applauded Giddy. Everything was so kindly and comfortable; Giddy and Ray, and their hospitable little house, and the easy-going country, and the stars. She curled up on the seat again with that warm, sleepy feeling of the friendliness of the world\u2014which nobody keeps very long, and which she was to lose early and irrevocably."}, "XVII": {"0": "The summer flew by. Thea was glad when Ray Kennedy had a Sunday in town and could take her driving. Out among the sand hills she could forget the \u201cnew room\u201d which was the scene of wearing and fruitless labor. Dr. Archie was away from home a good deal that year. He had put all his money into mines above Colorado Springs, and he hoped for great returns from them.", "1": "In the fall of that year, Mr. Kronborg decided that Thea ought to show more interest in church work. He put it to her frankly, one night at supper, before the whole family. \u201cHow can I insist on the other girls in the congregation being active in the work, when one of my own daughters manifests so little interest?\u201d", "2": "\u201cBut I sing every Sunday morning, and I have to give up one night a week to choir practice,\u201d Thea declared rebelliously, pushing back her plate with an angry determination to eat nothing more.", "3": "\u201cOne night a week is not enough for the pastor's daughter,\u201d her father replied. \u201cYou won't do anything in the sewing society, and you won't take part in the Christian Endeavor or the Band of Hope. Very well, you must make it up in other ways. I want some one to play the organ and lead the singing at prayer-meeting this winter. Deacon Potter told me some time ago that he thought there would be more interest in our prayer-meetings if we had the organ. Miss Meyers don't feel that she can play on Wednesday nights. And there ought to be somebody to start the hymns. Mrs. Potter is getting old, and she always starts them too high. It won't take much of your time, and it will keep people from talking.\u201d", "4": "This argument conquered Thea, though she left the table sullenly. The fear of the tongue, that terror of little towns, is usually felt more keenly by the minister's family than by other households. Whenever the Kronborgs wanted to do anything, even to buy a new carpet, they had to take counsel together as to whether people would talk. Mrs. Kronborg had her own conviction that people talked when they felt like it, and said what they chose, no matter how the minister's family conducted themselves. But she did not impart these dangerous ideas to her children. Thea was still under the belief that public opinion could be placated; that if you clucked often enough, the hens would mistake you for one of themselves.", "5": "Mrs. Kronborg did not have any particular zest for prayer-meetings, and she stayed at home whenever she had a valid excuse. Thor was too old to furnish such an excuse now, so every Wednesday night, unless one of the children was sick, she trudged off with Thea, behind Mr. Kronborg. At first Thea was terribly bored. But she got used to prayer-meeting, got even to feel a mournful interest in it.", "6": "The exercises were always pretty much the same. After the first hymn her father read a passage from the Bible, usually a Psalm. Then there was another hymn, and then her father commented upon the passage he had read and, as he said, \u201capplied the Word to our necessities.\u201d After a third hymn, the meeting was declared open, and the old men and women took turns at praying and talking. Mrs. Kronborg never spoke in meeting. She told people firmly that she had been brought up to keep silent and let the men talk, but she gave respectful attention to the others, sitting with her hands folded in her lap.", "7": "The prayer-meeting audience was always small. The young and energetic members of the congregation came only once or twice a year, \u201cto keep people from talking.\u201d The usual Wednesday night gathering was made up of old women, with perhaps six or eight old men, and a few sickly girls who had not much interest in life; two of them, indeed, were already preparing to die. Thea accepted the mournfulness of the prayer-meetings as a kind of spiritual discipline, like funerals. She always read late after she went home and felt a stronger wish than usual to live and to be happy.", "8": "The meetings were conducted in the Sunday-School room, where there were wooden chairs instead of pews; an old map of Palestine hung on the wall, and the bracket lamps gave out only a dim light. The old women sat motionless as Indians in their shawls and bonnets; some of them wore long black mourning veils. The old men drooped in their chairs. Every back, every face, every head said \u201cresignation.\u201d Often there were long silences, when you could hear nothing but the crackling of the soft coal in the stove and the muffled cough of one of the sick girls.", "9": "There was one nice old lady,\u2014tall, erect, self-respecting, with a delicate white face and a soft voice. She never whined, and what she said was always cheerful, though she spoke so nervously that Thea knew she dreaded getting up, and that she made a real sacrifice to, as she said, \u201ctestify to the goodness of her Saviour.\u201d She was the mother of the girl who coughed, and Thea used to wonder how she explained things to herself. There was, indeed, only one woman who talked because she was, as Mr. Kronborg said, \u201ctonguey.\u201d The others were somehow impressive. They told about the sweet thoughts that came to them while they were at their work; how, amid their household tasks, they were suddenly lifted by the sense of a divine Presence. Sometimes they told of their first conversion, of how in their youth that higher Power had made itself known to them. Old Mr. Carsen, the carpenter, who gave his services as janitor to the church, used often to tell how, when he was a young man and a scoffer, bent on the destruction of both body and soul, his Saviour had come to him in the Michigan woods and had stood, it seemed to him, beside the tree he was felling; and how he dropped his axe and knelt in prayer \u201cto Him who died for us upon the tree.\u201d Thea always wanted to ask him more about it; about his mysterious wickedness, and about the vision.", "10": "Sometimes the old people would ask for prayers for their absent children. Sometimes they asked their brothers and sisters in Christ to pray that they might be stronger against temptations. One of the sick girls used to ask them to pray that she might have more faith in the times of depression that came to her, \u201cwhen all the way before seemed dark.\u201d She repeated that husky phrase so often, that Thea always remembered it.", "11": "One old woman, who never missed a Wednesday night, and who nearly always took part in the meeting, came all the way up from the depot settlement. She always wore a black crocheted \u201cfascinator\u201d over her thin white hair, and she made long, tremulous prayers, full of railroad terminology. She had six sons in the service of different railroads, and she always prayed \u201cfor the boys on the road, who know not at what moment they may be cut off. When, in Thy divine wisdom, their hour is upon them, may they, O our Heavenly Father, see only white lights along the road to Eternity.\u201d She used to speak, too, of \u201cthe engines that race with death\u201d; and though she looked so old and little when she was on her knees, and her voice was so shaky, her prayers had a thrill of speed and danger in them; they made one think of the deep black canyons, the slender trestles, the pounding trains. Thea liked to look at her sunken eyes that seemed full of wisdom, at her black thread gloves, much too long in the fingers and so meekly folded one over the other. Her face was brown, and worn away as rocks are worn by water. There are many ways of describing that color of age, but in reality it is not like parchment, or like any of the things it is said to be like. That brownness and that texture of skin are found only in the faces of old human creatures, who have worked hard and who have always been poor.", "12": "One bitterly cold night in December the prayer-meeting seemed to Thea longer than usual. The prayers and the talks went on and on. It was as if the old people were afraid to go out into the cold, or were stupefied by the hot air of the room. She had left a book at home that she was impatient to get back to. At last the Doxology was sung, but the old people lingered about the stove to greet each other, and Thea took her mother's arm and hurried out to the frozen sidewalk, before her father could get away. The wind was whistling up the street and whipping the naked cottonwood trees against the telegraph poles and the sides of the houses. Thin snow clouds were flying overhead, so that the sky looked gray, with a dull phosphorescence. The icy streets and the shingle roofs of the houses were gray, too. All along the street, shutters banged or windows rattled, or gates wobbled, held by their latch but shaking on loose hinges. There was not a cat or a dog in Moonstone that night that was not given a warm shelter; the cats under the kitchen stove, the dogs in barns or coal-sheds. When Thea and her mother reached home, their mufflers were covered with ice, where their breath had frozen. They hurried into the house and made a dash for the parlor and the hard-coal burner, behind which Gunner was sitting on a stool, reading his Jules Verne book. The door stood open into the dining-room, which was heated from the parlor. Mr. Kronborg always had a lunch when he came home from prayer-meeting, and his pumpkin pie and milk were set out on the dining-table. Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she felt hungry, too, and asked Thea if she didn't want something to eat.", "13": "\u201cNo, I'm not hungry, mother. I guess I'll go upstairs.\u201d", "14": "\u201cI expect you've got some book up there,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg, bringing out another pie. \u201cYou'd better bring it down here and read. Nobody'll disturb you, and it's terrible cold up in that loft.\u201d", "15": "Thea was always assured that no one would disturb her if she read downstairs, but the boys talked when they came in, and her father fairly delivered discourses after he had been renewed by half a pie and a pitcher of milk.", "16": "\u201cI don't mind the cold. I'll take a hot brick up for my feet. I put one in the stove before I left, if one of the boys hasn't stolen it. Good-night, mother.\u201d Thea got her brick and lantern, and dashed upstairs through the windy loft. She undressed at top speed and got into bed with her brick. She put a pair of white knitted gloves on her hands, and pinned over her head a piece of soft flannel that had been one of Thor's long petticoats when he was a baby. Thus equipped, she was ready for business. She took from her table a thick paper-backed volume, one of the \u201cline\u201d of paper novels the druggist kept to sell to traveling men. She had bought it, only yesterday, because the first sentence interested her very much, and because she saw, as she glanced over the pages, the magical names of two Russian cities. The book was a poor translation of \u201cAnna Karenina.\u201d Thea opened it at a mark, and fixed her eyes intently upon the small print. The hymns, the sick girl, the resigned black figures were forgotten. It was the night of the ball in Moscow.", "17": "Thea would have been astonished if she could have known how, years afterward, when she had need of them, those old faces were to come back to her, long after they were hidden away under the earth; that they would seem to her then as full of meaning, as mysteriously marked by Destiny, as the people who danced the mazurka under the elegant Korsunsky."}, "XVIII": {"0": "Mr. Kronborg was too fond of his ease and too sensible to worry his children much about religion. He was more sincere than many preachers, but when he spoke to his family about matters of conduct it was usually with a regard for keeping up appearances. The church and church work were discussed in the family like the routine of any other business. Sunday was the hard day of the week with them, just as Saturday was the busy day with the merchants on Main Street. Revivals were seasons of extra work and pressure, just as threshing-time was on the farms. Visiting elders had to be lodged and cooked for, the folding-bed in the parlor was let down, and Mrs. Kronborg had to work in the kitchen all day long and attend the night meetings.", "1": "During one of these revivals Thea's sister Anna professed religion with, as Mrs. Kronborg said, \u201ca good deal of fluster.\u201d While Anna was going up to the mourners' bench nightly and asking for the prayers of the congregation, she disseminated general gloom throughout the household, and after she joined the church she took on an air of \u201cset-apartness\u201d that was extremely trying to her brothers and her sister, though they realized that Anna's sanctimoniousness was perhaps a good thing for their father. A preacher ought to have one child who did more than merely acquiesce in religious observances, and Thea and the boys were glad enough that it was Anna and not one of themselves who assumed this obligation.", "2": "\u201cAnna, she's American,\u201d Mrs. Kronborg used to say. The Scandinavian mould of countenance, more or less marked in each of the other children, was scarcely discernible in her, and she looked enough like other Moonstone girls to be thought pretty. Anna's nature was conventional, like her face. Her position as the minister's eldest daughter was important to her, and she tried to live up to it. She read sentimental religious story-books and emulated the spiritual struggles and magnanimous behavior of their persecuted heroines. Everything had to be interpreted for Anna. Her opinions about the smallest and most commonplace things were gleaned from the Denver papers, the church weeklies, from sermons and Sunday-School addresses. Scarcely anything was attractive to her in its natural state\u2014indeed, scarcely anything was decent until it was clothed by the opinion of some authority. Her ideas about habit, character, duty, love, marriage, were grouped under heads, like a book of popular quotations, and were totally unrelated to the emergencies of human living. She discussed all these subjects with other Methodist girls of her age. They would spend hours, for instance, in deciding what they would or would not tolerate in a suitor or a husband, and the frailties of masculine nature were too often a subject of discussion among them. In her behavior Anna was a harmless girl, mild except where her prejudices were concerned, neat and industrious, with no graver fault than priggishness; but her mind had really shocking habits of classification. The wickedness of Denver and of Chicago, and even of Moonstone, occupied her thoughts too much. She had none of the delicacy that goes with a nature of warm impulses, but the kind of fishy curiosity which justifies itself by an expression of horror.", "3": "Thea, and all Thea's ways and friends, seemed indecorous to Anna. She not only felt a grave social discrimination against the Mexicans; she could not forget that Spanish Johnny was a drunkard and that \u201cnobody knew what he did when he ran away from home.\u201d Thea pretended, of course, that she liked the Mexicans because they were fond of music; but every one knew that music was nothing very real, and that it did not matter in a girl's relations with people. What was real, then, and what did matter? Poor Anna!", "4": "Anna approved of Ray Kennedy as a young man of steady habits and blameless life, but she regretted that he was an atheist, and that he was not a passenger conductor with brass buttons on his coat. On the whole, she wondered what such an exemplary young man found to like in Thea. Dr. Archie she treated respectfully because of his position in Moonstone, but she KNEW he had kissed the Mexican barytone's pretty daughter, and she had a whole DOSSIER of evidence about his behavior in his hours of relaxation in Denver. He was \u201cfast,\u201d and it was because he was \u201cfast\u201d that Thea liked him. Thea always liked that kind of people. Dr. Archie's whole manner with Thea, Anna often told her mother, was too free. He was always putting his hand on Thea's head, or holding her hand while he laughed and looked down at her. The kindlier manifestation of human nature (about which Anna sang and talked, in the interests of which she went to conventions and wore white ribbons) were never realities to her after all. She did not believe in them. It was only in attitudes of protest or reproof, clinging to the cross, that human beings could be even temporarily decent.", "5": "Preacher Kronborg's secret convictions were very much like Anna's. He believed that his wife was absolutely good, but there was not a man or woman in his congregation whom he trusted all the way.", "6": "Mrs. Kronborg, on the other hand, was likely to find something to admire in almost any human conduct that was positive and energetic. She could always be taken in by the stories of tramps and runaway boys. She went to the circus and admired the bareback riders, who were \u201clikely good enough women in their way.\u201d She admired Dr. Archie's fine physique and well-cut clothes as much as Thea did, and said she \u201cfelt it was a privilege to be handled by such a gentleman when she was sick.\u201d", "7": "Soon after Anna became a church member she began to remonstrate with Thea about practicing\u2014playing \u201csecular music\u201d\u2014on Sunday. One Sunday the dispute in the parlor grew warm and was carried to Mrs. Kronborg in the kitchen. She listened judicially and told Anna to read the chapter about how Naaman the leper was permitted to bow down in the house of Rimmon. Thea went back to the piano, and Anna lingered to say that, since she was in the right, her mother should have supported her.", "8": "\u201cNo,\u201d said Mrs. Kronborg, rather indifferently, \u201cI can't see it that way, Anna. I never forced you to practice, and I don't see as I should keep Thea from it. I like to hear her, and I guess your father does. You and Thea will likely follow different lines, and I don't see as I'm called upon to bring you up alike.\u201d", "9": "Anna looked meek and abused. \u201cOf course all the church people must hear her. Ours is the only noisy house on this street. You hear what she's playing now, don't you?\u201d", "10": "Mrs. Kronborg rose from browning her coffee. \u201cYes; it's the Blue Danube waltzes. I'm familiar with 'em. If any of the church people come at you, you just send 'em to me. I ain't afraid to speak out on occasion, and I wouldn't mind one bit telling the Ladies' Aid a few things about standard composers.\u201d Mrs. Kronborg smiled, and added thoughtfully, \u201cNo, I wouldn't mind that one bit.\u201d", "11": "Anna went about with a reserved and distant air for a week, and Mrs. Kronborg suspected that she held a larger place than usual in her daughter's prayers; but that was another thing she didn't mind.", "12": "Although revivals were merely a part of the year's work, like examination week at school, and although Anna's piety impressed her very little, a time came when Thea was perplexed about religion. A scourge of typhoid broke out in Moonstone and several of Thea's schoolmates died of it. She went to their funerals, saw them put into the ground, and wondered a good deal about them. But a certain grim incident, which caused the epidemic, troubled her even more than the death of her friends.", "13": "Early in July, soon after Thea's fifteenth birthday, a particularly disgusting sort of tramp came into Moonstone in an empty box car. Thea was sitting in the hammock in the front yard when he first crawled up to the town from the depot, carrying a bundle wrapped in dirty ticking under one arm, and under the other a wooden box with rusty screening nailed over one end. He had a thin, hungry face covered with black hair. It was just before suppertime when he came along, and the street smelled of fried potatoes and fried onions and coffee. Thea saw him sniffing the air greedily and walking slower and slower. He looked over the fence. She hoped he would not stop at their gate, for her mother never turned any one away, and this was the dirtiest and most utterly wretched-looking tramp she had ever seen. There was a terrible odor about him, too. She caught it even at that distance, and put her handkerchief to her nose. A moment later she was sorry, for she knew that he had noticed it. He looked away and shuffled a little faster.", "14": "A few days later Thea heard that the tramp had camped in an empty shack over on the east edge of town, beside the ravine, and was trying to give a miserable sort of show there. He told the boys who went to see what he was doing, that he had traveled with a circus. His bundle contained a filthy clown's suit, and his box held half a dozen rattlesnakes.", "15": "Saturday night, when Thea went to the butcher shop to get the chickens for Sunday, she heard the whine of an accordion and saw a crowd before one of the saloons. There she found the tramp, his bony body grotesquely attired in the clown's suit, his face shaved and painted white,\u2014the sweat trickling through the paint and washing it away,\u2014and his eyes wild and feverish. Pulling the accordion in and out seemed to be almost too great an effort for him, and he panted to the tune of \u201cMarching through Georgia.\u201d After a considerable crowd had gathered, the tramp exhibited his box of snakes, announced that he would now pass the hat, and that when the onlookers had contributed the sum of one dollar, he would eat \u201cone of these living reptiles.\u201d The crowd began to cough and murmur, and the saloon keeper rushed off for the marshal, who arrested the wretch for giving a show without a license and hurried him away to the calaboose.", "16": "The calaboose stood in a sunflower patch,\u2014an old hut with a barred window and a padlock on the door. The tramp was utterly filthy and there was no way to give him a bath. The law made no provision to grub-stake vagrants, so after the constable had detained the tramp for twentyfour hours, he released him and told him to \u201cget out of town, and get quick.\u201d The fellow's rattlesnakes had been killed by the saloon keeper. He hid in a box car in the freight yard, probably hoping to get a ride to the next station, but he was found and put out. After that he was seen no more. He had disappeared and left no trace except an ugly, stupid word, chalked on the black paint of the seventy-five-foot standpipe which was the reservoir for the Moonstone water-supply; the same word, in another tongue, that the French soldier shouted at Waterloo to the English officer who bade the Old Guard surrender; a comment on life which the defeated, along the hard roads of the world, sometimes bawl at the victorious.", "17": "A week after the tramp excitement had passed over, the city water began to smell and to taste. The Kronborgs had a well in their back yard and did not use city water, but they heard the complaints of their neighbors. At first people said that the town well was full of rotting cottonwood roots, but the engineer at the pumping-station convinced the mayor that the water left the well untainted. Mayors reason slowly, but, the well being eliminated, the official mind had to travel toward the standpipe\u2014there was no other track for it to go in. The standpipe amply rewarded investigation. The tramp had got even with Moonstone. He had climbed the standpipe by the handholds and let himself down into seventy-five feet of cold water, with his shoes and hat and roll of ticking. The city council had a mild panic and passed a new ordinance about tramps. But the fever had already broken out, and several adults and half a dozen children died of it.", "18": "Thea had always found everything that happened in Moonstone exciting, disasters particularly so. It was gratifying to read sensational Moonstone items in the Denver paper. But she wished she had not chanced to see the tramp as he came into town that evening, sniffing the supper-laden air. His face remained unpleasantly clear in her memory, and her mind struggled with the problem of his behavior as if it were a hard page in arithmetic. Even when she was practicing, the drama of the tramp kept going on in the back of her head, and she was constantly trying to make herself realize what pitch of hatred or despair could drive a man to do such a hideous thing. She kept seeing him in his bedraggled clown suit, the white paint on his roughly shaven face, playing his accordion before the saloon. She had noticed his lean body, his high, bald forehead that sloped back like a curved metal lid. How could people fall so far out of fortune? She tried to talk to Ray Kennedy about her perplexity, but Ray would not discuss things of that sort with her. It was in his sentimental conception of women that they should be deeply religious, though men were at liberty to doubt and finally to deny. A picture called \u201cThe Soul Awakened,\u201d popular in Moonstone parlors, pretty well interpreted Ray's idea of woman's spiritual nature.", "19": "One evening when she was haunted by the figure of the tramp, Thea went up to Dr. Archie's office. She found him sewing up two bad gashes in the face of a little boy who had been kicked by a mule. After the boy had been bandaged and sent away with his father, Thea helped the doctor wash and put away the surgical instruments. Then she dropped into her accustomed seat beside his desk and began to talk about the tramp. Her eyes were hard and green with excitement, the doctor noticed.", "20": "\u201cIt seems to me, Dr. Archie, that the whole town's to blame. I'm to blame, myself. I know he saw me hold my nose when he went by. Father's to blame. If he believes the Bible, he ought to have gone to the calaboose and cleaned that man up and taken care of him. That's what I can't understand; do people believe the Bible, or don't they? If the next life is all that matters, and we're put here to get ready for it, then why do we try to make money, or learn things, or have a good time? There's not one person in Moonstone that really lives the way the New Testament says. Does it matter, or don't it?\u201d", "21": "Dr. Archie swung round in his chair and looked at her, honestly and leniently. \u201cWell, Thea, it seems to me like this. Every people has had its religion. All religions are good, and all are pretty much alike. But I don't see how we could live up to them in the sense you mean. I've thought about it a good deal, and I can't help feeling that while we are in this world we have to live for the best things of this world, and those things are material and positive. Now, most religions are passive, and they tell us chiefly what we should not do.\u201d The doctor moved restlessly, and his eyes hunted for something along the opposite wall: \u201cSee here, my girl, take out the years of early childhood and the time we spend in sleep and dull old age, and we only have about twenty able, waking years. That's not long enough to get acquainted with half the fine things that have been done in the world, much less to do anything ourselves. I think we ought to keep the Commandments and help other people all we can; but the main thing is to live those twenty splendid years; to do all we can and enjoy all we can.\u201d", "22": "Dr. Archie met his little friend's searching gaze, the look of acute inquiry which always touched him.", "23": "\u201cBut poor fellows like that tramp\u2014\u201d she hesitated and wrinkled her forehead.", "24": "The doctor leaned forward and put his hand protectingly over hers, which lay clenched on the green felt desktop. \u201cUgly accidents happen, Thea; always have and always will. But the failures are swept back into the pile and forgotten. They don't leave any lasting scar in the world, and they don't affect the future. The things that last are the good things. The people who forge ahead and do something, they really count.\u201d He saw tears on her cheeks, and he remembered that he had never seen her cry before, not even when she crushed her finger when she was little. He rose and walked to the window, came back and sat down on the edge of his chair.", "25": "\u201cForget the tramp, Thea. This is a great big world, and I want you to get about and see it all. You're going to Chicago some day, and do something with that fine voice of yours. You're going to be a number one musician and make us proud of you. Take Mary Anderson, now; even the tramps are proud of her. There isn't a tramp along the 'Q' system who hasn't heard of her. We all like people who do things, even if we only see their faces on a cigar-box lid.\u201d", "26": "They had a long talk. Thea felt that Dr. Archie had never let himself out to her so much before. It was the most grown-up conversation she had ever had with him. She left his office happy, flattered and stimulated. She ran for a long while about the white, moonlit streets, looking up at the stars and the bluish night, at the quiet houses sunk in black shade, the glittering sand hills. She loved the familiar trees, and the people in those little houses, and she loved the unknown world beyond Denver. She felt as if she were being pulled in two, between the desire to go away forever and the desire to stay forever. She had only twenty years\u2014no time to lose.", "27": "Many a night that summer she left Dr. Archie's office with a desire to run and run about those quiet streets until she wore out her shoes, or wore out the streets themselves; when her chest ached and it seemed as if her heart were spreading all over the desert. When she went home, it was not to go to sleep. She used to drag her mattress beside her low window and lie awake for a long while, vibrating with excitement, as a machine vibrates from speed. Life rushed in upon her through that window\u2014or so it seemed. In reality, of course, life rushes from within, not from without. There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that it was not once all contained in some youthful body, like this one which lay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardor and anticipation. It was on such nights that Thea Kronborg learned the thing that old Dumas meant when he told the Romanticists that to make a drama he needed but one passion and four walls."}, "XIX": {"0": "It is well for its peace of mind that the traveling public takes railroads so much for granted. The only men who are incurably nervous about railway travel are the railroad operatives. A railroad man never forgets that the next run may be his turn.", "1": "On a single-track road, like that upon which Ray Kennedy worked, the freight trains make their way as best they can between passenger trains. Even when there is such a thing as a freight time-schedule, it is merely a form. Along the one track dozens of fast and slow trains dash in both directions, kept from collision only by the brains in the dispatcher's office. If one passenger train is late, the whole schedule must be revised in an instant; the trains following must be warned, and those moving toward the belated train must be assigned new meeting-places.", "2": "Between the shifts and modifications of the passenger schedule, the freight trains play a game of their own. They have no right to the track at any given time, but are supposed to be on it when it is free, and to make the best time they can between passenger trains. A freight train, on a single-track road, gets anywhere at all only by stealing bases.", "3": "Ray Kennedy had stuck to the freight service, although he had had opportunities to go into the passenger service at higher pay. He always regarded railroading as a temporary makeshift, until he \u201cgot into something,\u201d and he disliked the passenger service. No brass buttons for him, he said; too much like a livery. While he was railroading he would wear a jumper, thank you!", "4": "The wreck that \u201ccaught\u201d Ray was a very commonplace one; nothing thrilling about it, and it got only six lines in the Denver papers. It happened about daybreak one morning, only thirty-two miles from home.", "5": "At four o'clock in the morning Ray's train had stopped to take water at Saxony, having just rounded the long curve which lies south of that station. It was Joe Giddy's business to walk back along the curve about three hundred yards and put out torpedoes to warn any train which might be coming up from behind\u2014a freight crew is not notified of trains following, and the brakeman is supposed to protect his train. Ray was so fussy about the punctilious observance of orders that almost any brakeman would take a chance once in a while, from natural perversity.", "6": "When the train stopped for water that morning, Ray was at the desk in his caboose, making out his report. Giddy took his torpedoes, swung off the rear platform, and glanced back at the curve. He decided that he would not go back to flag this time. If anything was coming up behind, he could hear it in plenty of time. So he ran forward to look after a hot journal that had been bothering him. In a general way, Giddy's reasoning was sound. If a freight train, or even a passenger train, had been coming up behind them, he could have heard it in time. But as it happened, a light engine, which made no noise at all, was coming,\u2014ordered out to help with the freight that was piling up at the other end of the division. This engine got no warning, came round the curve, struck the caboose, went straight through it, and crashed into the heavy lumber car ahead.", "7": "The Kronborgs were just sitting down to breakfast, when the night telegraph operator dashed into the yard at a run and hammered on the front door. Gunner answered the knock, and the telegraph operator told him he wanted to see his father a minute, quick. Mr. Kronborg appeared at the door, napkin in hand. The operator was pale and panting.", "8": "\u201cFourteen was wrecked down at Saxony this morning,\u201d he shouted, \u201cand Kennedy's all broke up. We're sending an engine down with the doctor, and the operator at Saxony says Kennedy wants you to come along with us and bring your girl.\u201d He stopped for breath.", "9": "Mr. Kronborg took off his glasses and began rubbing them with his napkin.", "10": "\u201cBring\u2014I don't understand,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d", "11": "\u201cNo time for that, sir. Getting the engine out now. Your girl, Thea. You'll surely do that for the poor chap. Everybody knows he thinks the world of her.\u201d Seeing that Mr. Kronborg showed no indication of having made up his mind, the operator turned to Gunner. \u201cCall your sister, kid. I'm going to ask the girl herself,\u201d he blurted out.", "12": "\u201cYes, yes, certainly. Daughter,\u201d Mr. Kronborg called. He had somewhat recovered himself and reached to the hall hatrack for his hat.", "13": "Just as Thea came out on the front porch, before the operator had had time to explain to her, Dr. Archie's ponies came up to the gate at a brisk trot. Archie jumped out the moment his driver stopped the team and came up to the bewildered girl without so much as saying good-morning to any one. He took her hand with the sympathetic, reassuring graveness which had helped her at more than one hard time in her life. \u201cGet your hat, my girl. Kennedy's hurt down the road, and he wants you to run down with me. They'll have a car for us. Get into my buggy, Mr. Kronborg. I'll drive you down, and Larry can come for the team.\u201d", "14": "The driver jumped out of the buggy and Mr. Kronborg and the doctor got in. Thea, still bewildered, sat on her father's knee. Dr. Archie gave his ponies a smart cut with the whip.", "15": "When they reached the depot, the engine, with one car attached, was standing on the main track. The engineer had got his steam up, and was leaning out of the cab impatiently. In a moment they were off. The run to Saxony took forty minutes. Thea sat still in her seat while Dr. Archie and her father talked about the wreck. She took no part in the conversation and asked no questions, but occasionally she looked at Dr. Archie with a frightened, inquiring glance, which he answered by an encouraging nod. Neither he nor her father said anything about how badly Ray was hurt. When the engine stopped near Saxony, the main track was already cleared. As they got out of the car, Dr. Archie pointed to a pile of ties.", "16": "\u201cThea, you'd better sit down here and watch the wreck crew while your father and I go up and look Kennedy over. I'll come back for you when I get him fixed up.\u201d", "17": "The two men went off up the sand gulch, and Thea sat down and looked at the pile of splintered wood and twisted iron that had lately been Ray's caboose. She was frightened and absent-minded. She felt that she ought to be thinking about Ray, but her mind kept racing off to all sorts of trivial and irrelevant things. She wondered whether Grace Johnson would be furious when she came to take her music lesson and found nobody there to give it to her; whether she had forgotten to close the piano last night and whether Thor would get into the new room and mess the keys all up with his sticky fingers; whether Tillie would go upstairs and make her bed for her. Her mind worked fast, but she could fix it upon nothing. The grasshoppers, the lizards, distracted her attention and seemed more real to her than poor Ray.", "18": "On their way to the sand bank where Ray had been carried, Dr. Archie and Mr. Kronborg met the Saxony doctor. He shook hands with them.", "19": "\u201cNothing you can do, doctor. I couldn't count the fractures. His back's broken, too. He wouldn't be alive now if he weren't so confoundedly strong, poor chap. No use bothering him. I've given him morphia, one and a half, in eighths.\u201d", "20": "Dr. Archie hurried on. Ray was lying on a flat canvas litter, under the shelter of a shelving bank, lightly shaded by a slender cottonwood tree. When the doctor and the preacher approached, he looked at them intently.", "21": "\u201cDidn't\u2014\u201d he closed his eyes to hide his bitter disappointment.", "22": "Dr. Archie knew what was the matter. \u201cThea's back there, Ray. I'll bring her as soon as I've had a look at you.\u201d", "23": "Ray looked up. \u201cYou might clean me up a trifle, doc. Won't need you for anything else, thank you all the same.\u201d", "24": "However little there was left of him, that little was certainly Ray Kennedy. His personality was as positive as ever, and the blood and dirt on his face seemed merely accidental, to have nothing to do with the man himself. Dr. Archie told Mr. Kronborg to bring a pail of water, and he began to sponge Ray's face and neck. Mr. Kronborg stood by, nervously rubbing his hands together and trying to think of something to say. Serious situations always embarrassed him and made him formal, even when he felt real sympathy.", "25": "\u201cIn times like this, Ray,\u201d he brought out at last, crumpling up his handkerchief in his long fingers,\u2014\u201cin times like this, we don't want to forget the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\u201d", "26": "Ray looked up at him; a lonely, disconsolate smile played over his mouth and his square cheeks. \u201cNever mind about all that, PADRE,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cChrist and me fell out long ago.\u201d", "27": "There was a moment of silence. Then Ray took pity on Mr. Kronborg's embarrassment. \u201cYou go back for the little girl, PADRE. I want a word with the doc in private.\u201d", "28": "Ray talked to Dr. Archie for a few moments, then stopped suddenly, with a broad smile. Over the doctor's shoulder he saw Thea coming up the gulch, in her pink chambray dress, carrying her sun-hat by the strings. Such a yellow head! He often told himself that he \u201cwas perfectly foolish about her hair.\u201d The sight of her, coming, went through him softly, like the morphia. \u201cThere she is,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGet the old preacher out of the way, doc. I want to have a little talk with her.\u201d", "29": "Dr. Archie looked up. Thea was hurrying and yet hanging back. She was more frightened than he had thought she would be. She had gone with him to see very sick people and had always been steady and calm. As she came up, she looked at the ground, and he could see that she had been crying.", "30": "Ray Kennedy made an unsuccessful effort to put out his hand. \u201cHello, little kid, nothing to be afraid of. Darned if I don't believe they've gone and scared you! Nothing to cry about. I'm the same old goods, only a little dented. Sit down on my coat there, and keep me company. I've got to lay still a bit.\u201d", "31": "Dr. Archie and Mr. Kronborg disappeared. Thea cast a timid glance after them, but she sat down resolutely and took Ray's hand.", "32": "\u201cYou ain't scared now, are you?\u201d he asked affectionately. \u201cYou were a regular brick to come, Thee. Did you get any breakfast?\u201d", "33": "\u201cNo, Ray, I'm not scared. Only I'm dreadful sorry you're hurt, and I can't help crying.\u201d", "34": "His broad, earnest face, languid from the opium and smiling with such simple happiness, reassured her. She drew nearer to him and lifted his hand to her knee. He looked at her with his clear, shallow blue eyes. How he loved everything about that face and head! How many nights in his cupola, looking up the track, he had seen that face in the darkness; through the sleet and snow, or in the soft blue air when the moonlight slept on the desert.", "35": "\u201cYou needn't bother to talk, Thee. The doctor's medicine makes me sort of dopey. But it's nice to have company. Kind of cozy, don't you think? Pull my coat under you more. It's a darned shame I can't wait on you.\u201d", "36": "\u201cNo, no, Ray. I'm all right. Yes, I like it here. And I guess you ought not to talk much, ought you? If you can sleep, I'll stay right here, and be awful quiet. I feel just as much at home with you as ever, now.\u201d", "37": "That simple, humble, faithful something in Ray's eyes went straight to Thea's heart. She did feel comfortable with him, and happy to give him so much happiness. It was the first time she had ever been conscious of that power to bestow intense happiness by simply being near any one. She always remembered this day as the beginning of that knowledge. She bent over him and put her lips softly to his cheek.", "38": "Ray's eyes filled with light. \u201cOh, do that again, kid!\u201d he said impulsively. Thea kissed him on the forehead, blushing faintly. Ray held her hand fast and closed his eyes with a deep sigh of happiness. The morphia and the sense of her nearness filled him with content. The gold mine, the oil well, the copper ledge\u2014all pipe dreams, he mused, and this was a dream, too. He might have known it before. It had always been like that; the things he admired had always been away out of his reach: a college education, a gentleman's manner, an Englishman's accent\u2014things over his head. And Thea was farther out of his reach than all the rest put together. He had been a fool to imagine it, but he was glad he had been a fool. She had given him one grand dream. Every mile of his run, from Moonstone to Denver, was painted with the colors of that hope. Every cactus knew about it. But now that it was not to be, he knew the truth. Thea was never meant for any rough fellow like him\u2014hadn't he really known that all along, he asked himself? She wasn't meant for common men. She was like wedding cake, a thing to dream on. He raised his eyelids a little. She was stroking his hand and looking off into the distance. He felt in her face that look of unconscious power that Wunsch had seen there. Yes, she was bound for the big terminals of the world; no way stations for her. His lids drooped. In the dark he could see her as she would be after a while; in a box at the Tabor Grand in Denver, with diamonds on her neck and a tiara in her yellow hair, with all the people looking at her through their opera-glasses, and a United States Senator, maybe, talking to her. \u201cThen you'll remember me!\u201d He opened his eyes, and they were full of tears.", "39": "Thea leaned closer. \u201cWhat did you say, Ray? I couldn't hear.\u201d", "40": "\u201cThen you'll remember me,\u201d he whispered.", "41": "The spark in his eye, which is one's very self, caught the spark in hers that was herself, and for a moment they looked into each other's natures. Thea realized how good and how great-hearted he was, and he realized about her many things. When that elusive spark of personality retreated in each of them, Thea still saw in his wet eyes her own face, very small, but much prettier than the cracked glass at home had ever shown it. It was the first time she had seen her face in that kindest mirror a woman can ever find.", "42": "Ray had felt things in that moment when he seemed to be looking into the very soul of Thea Kronborg. Yes, the gold mine, the oil well, the copper ledge, they'd all got away from him, as things will; but he'd backed a winner once in his life! With all his might he gave his faith to the broad little hand he held. He wished he could leave her the rugged strength of his body to help her through with it all. He would have liked to tell her a little about his old dream,\u2014there seemed long years between him and it already,\u2014but to tell her now would somehow be unfair; wouldn't be quite the straightest thing in the world. Probably she knew, anyway. He looked up quickly. \u201cYou know, don't you, Thee, that I think you are just the finest thing I've struck in this world?\u201d", "43": "The tears ran down Thea's cheeks. \u201cYou're too good to me, Ray. You're a lot too good to me,\u201d she faltered.", "44": "\u201cWhy, kid,\u201d he murmured, \u201ceverybody in this world's going to be good to you!\u201d", "45": "Dr. Archie came to the gulch and stood over his patient. \u201cHow's it going?\u201d", "46": "\u201cCan't you give me another punch with your pacifier, doc? The little girl had better run along now.\u201d Ray released Thea's hand. \u201cSee you later, Thee.\u201d", "47": "She got up and moved away aimlessly, carrying her hat by the strings. Ray looked after her with the exaltation born of bodily pain and said between his teeth, \u201cAlways look after that girl, doc. She's a queen!\u201d", "48": "Thea and her father went back to Moonstone on the one-o'clock passenger. Dr. Archie stayed with Ray Kennedy until he died, late in the afternoon."}, "XX": {"0": "On Monday morning, the day after Ray Kennedy's funeral, Dr. Archie called at Mr. Kronborg's study, a little room behind the church. Mr. Kronborg did not write out his sermons, but spoke from notes jotted upon small pieces of cardboard in a kind of shorthand of his own. As sermons go, they were not worse than most. His conventional rhetoric pleased the majority of his congregation, and Mr. Kronborg was generally regarded as a model preacher. He did not smoke, he never touched spirits. His indulgence in the pleasures of the table was an endearing bond between him and the women of his congregation. He ate enormously, with a zest which seemed incongruous with his spare frame.", "1": "This morning the doctor found him opening his mail and reading a pile of advertising circulars with deep attention.", "2": "\u201cGood-morning, Mr. Kronborg,\u201d said Dr. Archie, sitting down. \u201cI came to see you on business. Poor Kennedy asked me to look after his affairs for him. Like most railroad men he spent his wages, except for a few investments in mines which don't look to me very promising. But his life was insured for six hundred dollars in Thea's favor.\u201d", "3": "Mr. Kronborg wound his feet about the standard of his desk-chair. \u201cI assure you, doctor, this is a complete surprise to me.\u201d", "4": "\u201cWell, it's not very surprising to me,\u201d Dr. Archie went on. \u201cHe talked to me about it the day he was hurt. He said he wanted the money to be used in a particular way, and in no other.\u201d Dr. Archie paused meaningly.", "5": "Mr. Kronborg fidgeted. \u201cI am sure Thea would observe his wishes in every respect.\u201d", "6": "\u201cNo doubt; but he wanted me to see that you agreed to his plan. It seems that for some time Thea has wanted to go away to study music. It was Kennedy's wish that she should take this money and go to Chicago this winter. He felt that it would be an advantage to her in a business way: that even if she came back here to teach, it would give her more authority and make her position here more comfortable.\u201d", "7": "Mr. Kronborg looked a little startled. \u201cShe is very young,\u201d he hesitated; \u201cshe is barely seventeen. Chicago is a long way from home. We would have to consider. I think, Dr. Archie, we had better consult Mrs. Kronborg.\u201d", "8": "\u201cI think I can bring Mrs. Kronborg around, if I have your consent. I've always found her pretty level-headed. I have several old classmates practicing in Chicago. One is a throat specialist. He has a good deal to do with singers. He probably knows the best piano teachers and could recommend a boarding-house where music students stay. I think Thea needs to get among a lot of young people who are clever like herself. Here she has no companions but old fellows like me. It's not a natural life for a young girl. She'll either get warped, or wither up before her time. If it will make you and Mrs. Kronborg feel any easier, I'll be glad to take Thea to Chicago and see that she gets started right. This throat man I speak of is a big fellow in his line, and if I can get him interested, he may be able to put her in the way of a good many things. At any rate, he'll know the right teachers. Of course, six hundred dollars won't take her very far, but even half the winter there would be a great advantage. I think Kennedy sized the situation up exactly.\u201d", "9": "\u201cPerhaps; I don't doubt it. You are very kind, Dr. Archie.\u201d Mr. Kronborg was ornamenting his desk-blotter with hieroglyphics. \u201cI should think Denver might be better. There we could watch over her. She is very young.\u201d", "10": "Dr. Archie rose. \u201cKennedy didn't mention Denver. He said Chicago, repeatedly. Under the circumstances, it seems to me we ought to try to carry out his wishes exactly, if Thea is willing.\u201d", "11": "\u201cCertainly, certainly. Thea is conscientious. She would not waste her opportunities.\u201d Mr. Kronborg paused. \u201cIf Thea were your own daughter, doctor, would you consent to such a plan, at her present age?\u201d", "12": "\u201cI most certainly should. In fact, if she were my daughter, I'd have sent her away before this. She's a most unusual child, and she's only wasting herself here. At her age she ought to be learning, not teaching. She'll never learn so quickly and easily as she will right now.\u201d", "13": "\u201cWell, doctor, you had better talk it over with Mrs. Kronborg. I make it a point to defer to her wishes in such matters. She understands all her children perfectly. I may say that she has all a mother's insight, and more.\u201d", "14": "Dr. Archie smiled. \u201cYes, and then some. I feel quite confident about Mrs. Kronborg. We usually agree. Good-morning.\u201d", "15": "Dr. Archie stepped out into the hot sunshine and walked rapidly toward his office, with a determined look on his face. He found his waiting-room full of patients, and it was one o'clock before he had dismissed the last one. Then he shut his door and took a drink before going over to the hotel for his lunch. He smiled as he locked his cupboard. \u201cI feel almost as gay as if I were going to get away for a winter myself,\u201d he thought.", "16": "Afterward Thea could never remember much about that summer, or how she lived through her impatience. She was to set off with Dr. Archie on the fifteenth of October, and she gave lessons until the first of September. Then she began to get her clothes ready, and spent whole afternoons in the village dressmaker's stuffy, littered little sewing-room. Thea and her mother made a trip to Denver to buy the materials for her dresses. Ready-made clothes for girls were not to be had in those days. Miss Spencer, the dressmaker, declared that she could do handsomely by Thea if they would only let her carry out her own ideas. But Mrs. Kronborg and Thea felt that Miss Spencer's most daring productions might seem out of place in Chicago, so they restrained her with a firm hand. Tillie, who always helped Mrs. Kronborg with the family sewing, was for letting Miss Spencer challenge Chicago on Thea's person. Since Ray Kennedy's death, Thea had become more than ever one of Tillie's heroines. Tillie swore each of her friends to secrecy, and, coming home from church or leaning over the fence, told them the most touching stories about Ray's devotion, and how Thea would \u201cnever get over it.\u201d", "17": "Tillie's confidences stimulated the general discussion of Thea's venture. This discussion went on, upon front porches and in back yards, pretty much all summer. Some people approved of Thea's going to Chicago, but most people did not. There were others who changed their minds about it every day.", "18": "Tillie said she wanted Thea to have a ball dress \u201cabove all things.\u201d She bought a fashion book especially devoted to evening clothes and looked hungrily over the colored plates, picking out costumes that would be becoming to \u201ca blonde.\u201d She wanted Thea to have all the gay clothes she herself had always longed for; clothes she often told herself she needed \u201cto recite in.\u201d", "19": "\u201cTillie,\u201d Thea used to cry impatiently, \u201ccan't you see that if Miss Spencer tried to make one of those things, she'd make me look like a circus girl? Anyhow, I don't know anybody in Chicago. I won't be going to parties.\u201d", "20": "Tillie always replied with a knowing toss of her head, \u201cYou see! You'll be in society before you know it. There ain't many girls as accomplished as you.\u201d", "21": "On the morning of the fifteenth of October the Kronborg family, all of them but Gus, who couldn't leave the store, started for the station an hour before train time. Charley had taken Thea's trunk and telescope to the depot in his delivery wagon early that morning. Thea wore her new blue serge traveling-dress, chosen for its serviceable qualities. She had done her hair up carefully, and had put a pale-blue ribbon around her throat, under a little lace collar that Mrs. Kohler had crocheted for her. As they went out of the gate, Mrs. Kronborg looked her over thoughtfully. Yes, that blue ribbon went very well with the dress, and with Thea's eyes. Thea had a rather unusual touch about such things, she reflected comfortably. Tillie always said that Thea was \u201cso indifferent to dress,\u201d but her mother noticed that she usually put her clothes on well. She felt the more at ease about letting Thea go away from home, because she had good sense about her clothes and never tried to dress up too much. Her coloring was so individual, she was so unusually fair, that in the wrong clothes she might easily have been \u201cconspicuous.\u201d", "22": "It was a fine morning, and the family set out from the house in good spirits. Thea was quiet and calm. She had forgotten nothing, and she clung tightly to her handbag, which held her trunk-key and all of her money that was not in an envelope pinned to her chemise. Thea walked behind the others, holding Thor by the hand, and this time she did not feel that the procession was too long. Thor was uncommunicative that morning, and would only talk about how he would rather get a sand bur in his toe every day than wear shoes and stockings. As they passed the cottonwood grove where Thea often used to bring him in his cart, she asked him who would take him for nice long walks after sister went away.", "23": "\u201cOh, I can walk in our yard,\u201d he replied unappreciatively. \u201cI guess I can make a pond for my duck.\u201d", "24": "Thea leaned down and looked into his face. \u201cBut you won't forget about sister, will you?\u201d Thor shook his head. \u201cAnd won't you be glad when sister comes back and can take you over to Mrs. Kohler's to see the pigeons?\u201d", "25": "\u201cYes, I'll be glad. But I'm going to have a pigeon my own self.\u201d", "26": "\u201cBut you haven't got any little house for one. Maybe Axel would make you a little house.\u201d", "27": "\u201cOh, her can live in the barn, her can,\u201d Thor drawled indifferently.", "28": "Thea laughed and squeezed his hand. She always liked his sturdy matter-of-factness. Boys ought to be like that, she thought.", "29": "When they reached the depot, Mr. Kronborg paced the platform somewhat ceremoniously with his daughter. Any member of his flock would have gathered that he was giving her good counsel about meeting the temptations of the world. He did, indeed, begin to admonish her not to forget that talents come from our Heavenly Father and are to be used for his glory, but he cut his remarks short and looked at his watch. He believed that Thea was a religious girl, but when she looked at him with that intent, that passionately inquiring gaze which used to move even Wunsch, Mr. Kronborg suddenly felt his eloquence fail. Thea was like her mother, he reflected; you couldn't put much sentiment across with her. As a usual thing, he liked girls to be a little more responsive. He liked them to blush at his compliments; as Mrs. Kronborg candidly said, \u201cFather could be very soft with the girls.\u201d But this morning he was thinking that hard-headedness was a reassuring quality in a daughter who was going to Chicago alone.", "30": "Mr. Kronborg believed that big cities were places where people went to lose their identity and to be wicked. He himself, when he was a student at the Seminary\u2014he coughed and opened his watch again. He knew, of course, that a great deal of business went on in Chicago, that there was an active Board of Trade, and that hogs and cattle were slaughtered there. But when, as a young man, he had stopped over in Chicago, he had not interested himself in the commercial activities of the city. He remembered it as a place full of cheap shows and dance halls and boys from the country who were behaving disgustingly.", "31": "Dr. Archie drove up to the station about ten minutes before the train was due. His man tied the ponies and stood holding the doctor's alligator-skin bag\u2014very elegant, Thea thought it. Mrs. Kronborg did not burden the doctor with warnings and cautions. She said again that she hoped he could get Thea a comfortable place to stay, where they had good beds, and she hoped the landlady would be a woman who'd had children of her own. \u201cI don't go much on old maids looking after girls,\u201d she remarked as she took a pin out of her own hat and thrust it into Thea's blue turban. \u201cYou'll be sure to lose your hatpins on the train, Thea. It's better to have an extra one in case.\u201d She tucked in a little curl that had escaped from Thea's careful twist. \u201cDon't forget to brush your dress often, and pin it up to the curtains of your berth to-night, so it won't wrinkle. If you get it wet, have a tailor press it before it draws.\u201d", "32": "She turned Thea about by the shoulders and looked her over a last time. Yes, she looked very well. She wasn't pretty, exactly,\u2014her face was too broad and her nose was too big. But she had that lovely skin, and she looked fresh and sweet. She had always been a sweet-smelling child. Her mother had always liked to kiss her, when she happened to think of it.", "33": "The train whistled in, and Mr. Kronborg carried the canvas \u201ctelescope\u201d into the car. Thea kissed them all good-bye. Tillie cried, but she was the only one who did. They all shouted things up at the closed window of the Pullman car, from which Thea looked down at them as from a frame, her face glowing with excitement, her turban a little tilted in spite of three hatpins. She had already taken off her new gloves to save them. Mrs. Kronborg reflected that she would never see just that same picture again, and as Thea's car slid off along the rails, she wiped a tear from her eye. \u201cShe won't come back a little girl,\u201d Mrs. Kronborg said to her husband as they turned to go home. \u201cAnyhow, she's been a sweet one.\u201d", "34": "While the Kronborg family were trooping slowly homeward, Thea was sitting in the Pullman, her telescope in the seat beside her, her handbag tightly gripped in her fingers. Dr. Archie had gone into the smoker. He thought she might be a little tearful, and that it would be kinder to leave her alone for a while. Her eyes did fill once, when she saw the last of the sand hills and realized that she was going to leave them behind for a long while. They always made her think of Ray, too. She had had such good times with him out there.", "35": "But, of course, it was herself and her own adventure that mattered to her. If youth did not matter so much to itself, it would never have the heart to go on. Thea was surprised that she did not feel a deeper sense of loss at leaving her old life behind her. It seemed, on the contrary, as she looked out at the yellow desert speeding by, that she had left very little. Everything that was essential seemed to be right there in the car with her. She lacked nothing. She even felt more compact and confident than usual. She was all there, and something else was there, too,\u2014in her heart, was it, or under her cheek? Anyhow, it was about her somewhere, that warm sureness, that sturdy little companion with whom she shared a secret.", "36": "When Dr. Archie came in from the smoker, she was sitting still, looking intently out of the window and smiling, her lips a little parted, her hair in a blaze of sunshine. The doctor thought she was the prettiest thing he had ever seen, and very funny, with her telescope and big handbag. She made him feel jolly, and a little mournful, too. He knew that the splendid things of life are few, after all, and so very easy to miss."}, "21": {}, "33": {}, "40": {}, "49": {}, "55": {}, "67": {"0": "MOONSTONE again, in the year 1909. The Methodists are giving an ice-cream sociable in the grove about the new court-house. It is a warm summer night of full moon. The paper lanterns which hang among the trees are foolish toys, only dimming, in little lurid circles, the great softness of the lunar light that floods the blue heavens and the high plateau. To the east the sand hills shine white as of old, but the empire of the sand is gradually diminishing. The grass grows thicker over the dunes than it used to, and the streets of the town are harder and firmer than they were twenty-five years ago. The old inhabitants will tell you that sandstorms are infrequent now, that the wind blows less persistently in the spring and plays a milder tune. Cultivation has modified the soil and the climate, as it modifies human life.", "1": "The people seated about under the cottonwoods are much smarter than the Methodists we used to know. The interior of the new Methodist Church looks like a theater, with a sloping floor, and as the congregation proudly say, \u201copera chairs.\u201d The matrons who attend to serving the refreshments to-night look younger for their years than did the women of Mrs. Kronborg's time, and the children all look like city children. The little boys wear \u201cBuster Browns\u201d and the little girls Russian blouses. The country child, in made-overs and cut-downs, seems to have vanished from the face of the earth.", "2": "At one of the tables, with her Dutch-cut twin boys, sits a fair-haired, dimpled matron who was once Lily Fisher. Her husband is president of the new bank, and she \u201cgoes East for her summers,\u201d a practice which causes envy and discontent among her neighbors. The twins are well-behaved children, biddable, meek, neat about their clothes, and always mindful of the proprieties they have learned at summer hotels. While they are eating their icecream and trying not to twist the spoon in their mouths, a little shriek of laughter breaks from an adjacent table. The twins look up. There sits a spry little old spinster whom they know well. She has a long chin, a long nose, and she is dressed like a young girl, with a pink sash and a lace garden hat with pink rosebuds. She is surrounded by a crowd of boys,\u2014loose and lanky, short and thick,\u2014who are joking with her roughly, but not unkindly.", "3": "\u201cMamma,\u201d one of the twins comes out in a shrill treble, \u201cwhy is Tillie Kronborg always talking about a thousand dollars?\u201d", "4": "The boys, hearing this question, break into a roar of laughter, the women titter behind their paper napkins, and even from Tillie there is a little shriek of appreciation. The observing child's remark had made every one suddenly realize that Tillie never stopped talking about that particular sum of money. In the spring, when she went to buy early strawberries, and was told that they were thirty cents a box, she was sure to remind the grocer that though her name was Kronborg she didn't get a thousand dollars a night. In the autumn, when she went to buy her coal for the winter, she expressed amazement at the price quoted her, and told the dealer he must have got her mixed up with her niece to think she could pay such a sum. When she was making her Christmas presents, she never failed to ask the women who came into her shop what you COULD make for anybody who got a thousand dollars a night. When the Denver papers announced that Thea Kronborg had married Frederick Ottenburg, the head of the Brewers' Trust, Moonstone people expected that Tillie's vain-gloriousness would take another form. But Tillie had hoped that Thea would marry a title, and she did not boast much about Ottenburg,\u2014at least not until after her memorable trip to Kansas City to hear Thea sing.", "5": "Tillie is the last Kronborg left in Moonstone. She lives alone in a little house with a green yard, and keeps a fancywork and millinery store. Her business methods are informal, and she would never come out even at the end of the year, if she did not receive a draft for a good round sum from her niece at Christmas time. The arrival of this draft always renews the discussion as to what Thea would do for her aunt if she really did the right thing. Most of the Moonstone people think Thea ought to take Tillie to New York and keep her as a companion. While they are feeling sorry for Tillie because she does not live at the Plaza, Tillie is trying not to hurt their feelings by showing too plainly how much she realizes the superiority of her position. She tries to be modest when she complains to the postmaster that her New York paper is more than three days late. It means enough, surely, on the face of it, that she is the only person in Moonstone who takes a New York paper or who has any reason for taking one. A foolish young girl, Tillie lived in the splendid sorrows of \u201cWanda\u201d and \u201cStrathmore\u201d; a foolish old girl, she lives in her niece's triumphs. As she often says, she just missed going on the stage herself.", "6": "That night after the sociable, as Tillie tripped home with a crowd of noisy boys and girls, she was perhaps a shade troubled. The twin's question rather lingered in her ears. Did she, perhaps, insist too much on that thousand dollars? Surely, people didn't for a minute think it was the money she cared about? As for that, Tillie tossed her head, she didn't care a rap. They must understand that this money was different.", "7": "When the laughing little group that brought her home had gone weaving down the sidewalk through the leafy shadows and had disappeared, Tillie brought out a rocking chair and sat down on her porch. On glorious, soft summer nights like this, when the moon is opulent and full, the day submerged and forgotten, she loves to sit there behind her rose-vine and let her fancy wander where it will. If you chanced to be passing down that Moonstone street and saw that alert white figure rocking there behind the screen of roses and lingering late into the night, you might feel sorry for her, and how mistaken you would be! Tillie lives in a little magic world, full of secret satisfactions. Thea Kronborg has given much noble pleasure to a world that needs all it can get, but to no individual has she given more than to her queer old aunt in Moonstone. The legend of Kronborg, the artist, fills Tillie's life; she feels rich and exalted in it. What delightful things happen in her mind as she sits there rocking! She goes back to those early days of sand and sun, when Thea was a child and Tillie was herself, so it seems to her, \u201cyoung.\u201d When she used to hurry to church to hear Mr. Kronborg's wonderful sermons, and when Thea used to stand up by the organ of a bright Sunday morning and sing \u201cCome, Ye Disconsolate.\u201d Or she thinks about that wonderful time when the Metropolitan Opera Company sang a week's engagement in Kansas City, and Thea sent for her and had her stay with her at the Coates House and go to every performance at Convention Hall. Thea let Tillie go through her costume trunks and try on her wigs and jewels. And the kindness of Mr. Ottenburg! When Thea dined in her own room, he went down to dinner with Tillie, and never looked bored or absent-minded when she chattered. He took her to the hall the first time Thea sang there, and sat in the box with her and helped her through \u201cLohengrin.\u201d After the first act, when Tillie turned tearful eyes to him and burst out, \u201cI don't care, she always seemed grand like that, even when she was a girl. I expect I'm crazy, but she just seems to me full of all them old times!\u201d\u2014Ottenburg was so sympathetic and patted her hand and said, \u201cBut that's just what she is, full of the old times, and you are a wise woman to see it.\u201d Yes, he said that to her. Tillie often wondered how she had been able to bear it when Thea came down the stairs in the wedding robe embroidered in silver, with a train so long it took six women to carry it.", "8": "Tillie had lived fifty-odd years for that week, but she got it, and no miracle was ever more miraculous than that. When she used to be working in the fields on her father's Minnesota farm, she couldn't help believing that she would some day have to do with the \u201cwonderful,\u201d though her chances for it had then looked so slender.", "9": "The morning after the sociable, Tillie, curled up in bed, was roused by the rattle of the milk cart down the street. Then a neighbor boy came down the sidewalk outside her window, singing \u201cCasey Jones\u201d as if he hadn't a care in the world. By this time Tillie was wide awake. The twin's question, and the subsequent laughter, came back with a faint twinge. Tillie knew she was short-sighted about facts, but this time\u2014Why, there were her scrapbooks, full of newspaper and magazine articles about Thea, and half-tone cuts, snap-shots of her on land and sea, and photographs of her in all her parts. There, in her parlor, was the phonograph that had come from Mr. Ottenburg last June, on Thea's birthday; she had only to go in there and turn it on, and let Thea speak for herself. Tillie finished brushing her white hair and laughed as she gave it a smart turn and brought it into her usual French twist. If Moonstone doubted, she had evidence enough: in black and white, in figures and photographs, evidence in hair lines on metal disks. For one who had so often seen two and two as making six, who had so often stretched a point, added a touch, in the good game of trying to make the world brighter than it is, there was positive bliss in having such deep foundations of support. She need never tremble in secret lest she might sometime stretch a point in Thea's favor.\u2014Oh, the comfort, to a soul too zealous, of having at last a rose so red it could not be further painted, a lily so truly auriferous that no amount of gilding could exceed the fact!", "10": "Tillie hurried from her bedroom, threw open the doors and windows, and let the morning breeze blow through her little house.", "11": "In two minutes a cob fire was roaring in her kitchen stove, in five she had set the table. At her household work Tillie was always bursting out with shrill snatches of song, and as suddenly stopping, right in the middle of a phrase, as if she had been struck dumb. She emerged upon the back porch with one of these bursts, and bent down to get her butter and cream out of the ice-box. The cat was purring on the bench and the morning-glories were thrusting their purple trumpets in through the lattice-work in a friendly way. They reminded Tillie that while she was waiting for the coffee to boil she could get some flowers for her breakfast table. She looked out uncertainly at a bush of sweet-briar that grew at the edge of her yard, off across the long grass and the tomato vines. The front porch, to be sure, was dripping with crimson ramblers that ought to be cut for the good of the vines; but never the rose in the hand for Tillie! She caught up the kitchen shears and off she dashed through grass and drenching dew. Snip, snip; the short-stemmed sweet-briars, salmon-pink and golden-hearted, with their unique and inimitable woody perfume, fell into her apron.", "12": "After she put the eggs and toast on the table, Tillie took last Sunday's New York paper from the rack beside the cupboard and sat down, with it for company. In the Sunday paper there was always a page about singers, even in summer, and that week the musical page began with a sympathetic account of Madame Kronborg's first performance of ISOLDE in London. At the end of the notice, there was a short paragraph about her having sung for the King at Buckingham Palace and having been presented with a jewel by His Majesty.", "13": "Singing for the King; but Goodness! she was always doing things like that! Tillie tossed her head. All through breakfast she kept sticking her sharp nose down into the glass of sweet-briar, with the old incredible lightness of heart, like a child's balloon tugging at its string. She had always insisted, against all evidence, that life was full of fairy tales, and it was! She had been feeling a little down, perhaps, and Thea had answered her, from so far. From a common person, now, if you were troubled, you might get a letter. But Thea almost never wrote letters. She answered every one, friends and foes alike, in one way, her own way, her only way. Once more Tillie has to remind herself that it is all true, and is not something she has \u201cmade up.\u201d Like all romancers, she is a little terrified at seeing one of her wildest conceits admitted by the hardheaded world. If our dream comes true, we are almost afraid to believe it; for that is the best of all good fortune, and nothing better can happen to any of us.", "14": "When the people on Sylvester Street tire of Tillie's stories, she goes over to the east part of town, where her legends are always welcome. The humbler people of Moonstone still live there. The same little houses sit under the cottonwoods; the men smoke their pipes in the front doorways, and the women do their washing in the back yard. The older women remember Thea, and how she used to come kicking her express wagon along the sidewalk, steering by the tongue and holding Thor in her lap. Not much happens in that part of town, and the people have long memories. A boy grew up on one of those streets who went to Omaha and built up a great business, and is now very rich. Moonstone people always speak of him and Thea together, as examples of Moonstone enterprise. They do, however, talk oftener of Thea. A voice has even a wider appeal than a fortune. It is the one gift that all creatures would possess if they could. Dreary Maggie Evans, dead nearly twenty years, is still remembered because Thea sang at her funeral \u201cafter she had studied in Chicago.\u201d", "15": "However much they may smile at her, the old inhabitants would miss Tillie. Her stories give them something to talk about and to conjecture about, cut off as they are from the restless currents of the world. The many naked little sandbars which lie between Venice and the mainland, in the seemingly stagnant water of the lagoons, are made habitable and wholesome only because, every night, a foot and a half of tide creeps in from the sea and winds its fresh brine up through all that network of shining waterways. So, into all the little settlements of quiet people, tidings of what their boys and girls are doing in the world bring real refreshment; bring to the old, memories, and to the young, dreams.", "16": "THE END"}}}, {"title": "Anne of the Island", "author": "Montgomery, L.

Of course, it was silly\u2014but it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world. You remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed\u2014but not the Green Gables spare room. Oh, no, never there! It would have been too terrible\u2014I couldn\u2019t have slept a wink from awe. I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in on an errand\u2014no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath, as if I were in church, and felt relieved when I got out of it. The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there, one on each side of the mirror, and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror, which was the only one in the house that didn\u2019t twist my face a little. I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room. And now it\u2019s not only cleaned but stripped bare. George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall. \u2018So passes the glory of this world,\u2019\u201d concluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret. It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even when we have outgrown them.", "9": "\u201cI\u2019ll be so lonesome when you go,\u201d moaned Diana for the hundredth time. \u201cAnd to think you go next week!\u201d", "10": "\u201cBut we\u2019re together still,\u201d said Anne cheerily. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let next week rob us of this week\u2019s joy.

Anne shivered over the disagreeable recollection. But all problems connected with infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the homely, unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an eight-year-old boy was crying grievously on the sofa.", "32": "\u201cWhat is the matter, Davy?\u201d asked Anne, taking him up in her arms. \u201cWhere are Marilla and Dora?\u201d", "33": "\u201cMarilla\u2019s putting Dora to bed,\u201d sobbed Davy, \u201cand I\u2019m crying \u2018cause Dora fell down the outside cellar steps, heels over head, and scraped all the skin off her nose, and\u2014\u201d", "34": "\u201cOh, well, don\u2019t cry about it, dear.

Why?\u201d", "41": "\u201c\u2018Cause,\u201d said Davy very decidedly, \u201cif she does I won\u2019t say my prayers before her like I do before you, Anne.\u201d", "42": "\u201cWhy not?\u201d", "43": "\u201c\u2018Cause I don\u2019t think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers, Anne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll wait till she\u2019s gone and then say \u2018em. Won\u2019t that be all right, Anne?\u201d", "44": "\u201cYes, if you are sure you won\u2019t forget to say them, Davy-boy.\u201d", "45": "\u201cOh, I won\u2019t forget, you bet. I think saying my prayers is great fun. But it won\u2019t be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you. I wish you\u2019d stay home, Anne. I don\u2019t see what you want to go away and leave us for.\u201d", "46": "\u201cI don\u2019t exactly WANT to, Davy, but I feel I ought to go.\u201d", "47": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go you needn\u2019t. You\u2019re grown up. When I\u2019m grown up I\u2019m not going to do one single thing I don\u2019t want to do, Anne.\u201d", "48": "\u201cAll your life, Davy, you\u2019ll find yourself doing things you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d", "49": "\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Davy flatly. \u201cCatch me! I have to do things I don\u2019t want to now \u2018cause you and Marilla\u2019ll send me to bed if I don\u2019t. But when I grow up you can\u2019t do that, and there\u2019ll be nobody to tell me not to do things. Won\u2019t I have the time! Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says his mother says you\u2019re going to college to see if you can catch a man. Are you, Anne? I want to know.\u201d", "50": "For a second Anne burned with resentment. Then she laughed, reminding herself that Mrs. Boulter\u2019s crude vulgarity of thought and speech could not harm her.", "51": "\u201cNo, Davy, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m going to study and grow and learn about many things.\u201d", "52": "\u201cWhat things?\u201d", "53": "quoted Anne.", "54": "\u201cBut if you DID want to catch a man how would you go about it? I want to know,\u201d persisted Davy, for whom the subject evidently possessed a certain fascination.", "55": "\u201cYou\u2019d better ask Mrs. Boulter,\u201d said Anne thoughtlessly. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely she knows more about the process than I do.\u201d", "56": "\u201cI will, the next time I see her,\u201d said Davy gravely.", "57": "\u201cDavy! If you do!\u201d cried Anne, realizing her mistake.", "58": "\u201cBut you just told me to,\u201d protested Davy aggrieved.", "59": "\u201cIt\u2019s time you went to bed,\u201d decreed Anne, by way of getting out of the scrape.", "60": "After Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island and sat there alone, curtained with fine-spun, moonlit gloom, while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind. Anne had always loved that brook. Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in days gone by. She forgot lovelorn youths, and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors, and all the problems of her girlish existence. In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of \u201cfaery lands forlorn,\u201d where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart\u2019s Desire. And she was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal."}, "Chapter II": {"0": "The following week sped swiftly, crowded with innumerable \u201clast things,\u201d as Anne called them. Good-bye calls had to be made and received, being pleasant or otherwise, according to whether callers and called-upon were heartily in sympathy with Anne\u2019s hopes, or thought she was too much puffed-up over going to college and that it was their duty to \u201ctake her down a peg or two.\u201d", "1": "The A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one evening at the home of Josie Pye, choosing that place, partly because Mr. Pye\u2019s house was large and convenient, partly because it was strongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted. It was a very pleasant little time, for the Pye girls were gracious, and said and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion\u2014which was not according to their wont. Josie was unusually amiable\u2014so much so that she even remarked condescendingly to Anne,", "2": "\u201cYour new dress is rather becoming to you, Anne. Really, you look ALMOST PRETTY in it.\u201d", "3": "\u201cHow kind of you to say so,\u201d responded Anne, with dancing eyes. Her sense of humor was developing, and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now. Josie suspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes; but she contented herself with whispering to Gertie, as they went downstairs, that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was going to college\u2014you\u2019d see!", "4": "All the \u201cold crowd\u201d was there, full of mirth and zest and youthful lightheartedness. Diana Barry, rosy and dimpled, shadowed by the faithful Fred; Jane Andrews, neat and sensible and plain; Ruby Gillis, looking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse, with red geraniums in her golden hair; Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane, both trying to keep as near the elusive Anne as possible; Carrie Sloane, looking pale and melancholy because, so it was reported, her father would not allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place; Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and objectionable as ever; and Billy Andrews, who sat in a corner all the evening, chuckled when any one spoke to him, and watched Anne Shirley with a grin of pleasure on his broad, freckled countenance.", "5": "Anne had known beforehand of the party, but she had not known that she and Gilbert were, as the founders of the Society, to be presented with a very complimentary \u201caddress\u201d and \u201ctokens of respect\u201d\u2014in her case a volume of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, in Gilbert\u2019s a fountain pen. She was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address, read in Moody Spurgeon\u2019s most solemn and ministerial tones, that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes. She had worked hard and faithfully for the A.V.I.S., and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely. And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly\u2014even the Pye girls had their merits; at that moment Anne loved all the world.", "6": "She enjoyed the evening tremendously, but the end of it rather spoiled all. Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah; and Anne, to punish him, was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to walk home with her. She found, however, that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who tries to inflict it. Gilbert walked airily off with Ruby Gillis, and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they loitered along in the still, crisp autumn air. They were evidently having the best of good times, while she was horribly bored by Charlie Sloane, who talked unbrokenly on, and never, even by accident, said one thing that was worth listening to. Anne gave an occasional absent \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and thought how beautiful Ruby had looked that night, how very goggly Charlie\u2019s eyes were in the moonlight\u2014worse even than by daylight\u2014and that the world, somehow, wasn\u2019t quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in the evening.", "7": "\u201cI\u2019m just tired out\u2014that is what is the matter with me,\u201d she said, when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room. And she honestly believed it was. But a certain little gush of joy, as from some secret, unknown spring, bubbled up in her heart the next evening, when she saw Gilbert striding down through the Haunted Wood and crossing the old log bridge with that firm, quick step of his. So Gilbert was not going to spend this last evening with Ruby Gillis after all!", "8": "\u201cYou look tired, Anne,\u201d he said.", "9": "\u201cI am tired, and, worse than that, I\u2019m disgruntled. I\u2019m tired because I\u2019ve been packing my trunk and sewing all day. But I\u2019m disgruntled because six women have been here to say good-bye to me, and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November morning.\u201d", "10": "\u201cSpiteful old cats!\u201d was Gilbert\u2019s elegant comment.", "11": "\u201cOh, no, they weren\u2019t,\u201d said Anne seriously. \u201cThat is just the trouble. If they had been spiteful cats I wouldn\u2019t have minded them. But they are all nice, kind, motherly souls, who like me and whom I like, and that is why what they said, or hinted, had such undue weight with me. They let me see they thought I was crazy going to Redmond and trying to take a B.A., and ever since I\u2019ve been wondering if I am. Mrs. Peter Sloane sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till I got through; and at once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the end of my third year; Mrs. Eben Wright said it must cost an awful lot to put in four years at Redmond; and I felt all over me that it was unpardonable of me to squander Marilla\u2019s money and my own on such a folly. Mrs. Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldn\u2019t let college spoil me, as it did some people; and I felt in my bones that the end of my four Redmond years would see me a most insufferable creature, thinking I knew it all, and looking down on everything and everybody in Avonlea; Mrs. Elisha Wright said she understood that Redmond girls, especially those who belonged to Kingsport, were \u2018dreadful dressy and stuck-up,\u2019 and she guessed I wouldn\u2019t feel much at home among them; and I saw myself, a snubbed, dowdy, humiliated country girl, shuffling through Redmond\u2019s classic halls in coppertoned boots.\u201d", "12": "Anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled. With her sensitive nature all disapproval had weight, even the disapproval of those for whose opinions she had scant respect. For the time being life was savorless, and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle.", "13": "\u201cYou surely don\u2019t care for what they said,\u201d protested Gilbert. \u201cYou know exactly how narrow their outlook on life is, excellent creatures though they are. To do anything THEY have never done is anathema maranatha. You are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college; and you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck madness.\u201d", "14": "\u201cOh, I know. But FEELING is so different from KNOWING. My common sense tells me all you can say, but there are times when common sense has no power over me. Common nonsense takes possession of my soul. Really, after Mrs. Elisha went away I hardly had the heart to finish packing.\u201d", "15": "\u201cYou\u2019re just tired, Anne. Come, forget it all and take a walk with me\u2014a ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh. There should be something there I want to show you.\u201d", "16": "\u201cShould be! Don\u2019t you know if it is there?\u201d", "17": "\u201cNo. I only know it should be, from something I saw there in spring. Come on. We\u2019ll pretend we are two children again and we\u2019ll go the way of the wind.\u201d", "18": "They started gaily off. Anne, remembering the unpleasantness of the preceding evening, was very nice to Gilbert; and Gilbert, who was learning wisdom, took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade again. Mrs. Lynde and Marilla watched them from the kitchen window.", "19": "\u201cThat\u2019ll be a match some day,\u201d Mrs. Lynde said approvingly.", "20": "Marilla winced slightly. In her heart she hoped it would, but it went against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in Mrs. Lynde\u2019s gossipy matter-of-fact way.", "21": "\u201cThey\u2019re only children yet,\u201d she said shortly.", "22": "Mrs. Lynde laughed good-naturedly.", "23": "\u201cAnne is eighteen; I was married when I was that age. We old folks, Marilla, are too much given to thinking children never grow up, that\u2019s what. Anne is a young woman and Gilbert\u2019s a man, and he worships the ground she walks on, as any one can see. He\u2019s a fine fellow, and Anne can\u2019t do better. I hope she won\u2019t get any romantic nonsense into her head at Redmond. I don\u2019t approve of them coeducational places and never did, that\u2019s what. I don\u2019t believe,\u201d concluded Mrs. Lynde solemnly, \u201cthat the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt.\u201d", "24": "\u201cThey must study a little,\u201d said Marilla, with a smile.", "25": "\u201cPrecious little,\u201d sniffed Mrs. Rachel. \u201cHowever, I think Anne will. She never was flirtatious. But she doesn\u2019t appreciate Gilbert at his full value, that\u2019s what. Oh, I know girls! Charlie Sloane is wild about her, too, but I\u2019d never advise her to marry a Sloane. The Sloanes are good, honest, respectable people, of course. But when all\u2019s said and done, they\u2019re SLOANES.\u201d", "26": "Marilla nodded. To an outsider, the statement that Sloanes were Sloanes might not be very illuminating, but she understood. Every village has such a family; good, honest, respectable people they may be, but SLOANES they are and must ever remain, though they speak with the tongues of men and angels.", "27": "Gilbert and Anne, happily unconscious that their future was thus being settled by Mrs. Rachel, were sauntering through the shadows of the Haunted Wood. Beyond, the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset radiance, under a pale, aerial sky of rose and blue. The distant spruce groves were burnished bronze, and their long shadows barred the upland meadows. But around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels, and in it there was the note of autumn.", "28": "\u201cThis wood really is haunted now\u2014by old memories,\u201d said Anne, stooping to gather a spray of ferns, bleached to waxen whiteness by frost. \u201cIt seems to me that the little girls Diana and I used to be play here still, and sit by the Dryad\u2019s Bubble in the twilights, trysting with the ghosts. Do you know, I can never go up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver? There was one especially horrifying phantom which we created\u2014the ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours. I confess that, to this day, I cannot help fancying its little, furtive footsteps behind me when I come here after nightfall. I\u2019m not afraid of the White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons, but I wish I had never imagined that baby\u2019s ghost into existence. How angry Marilla and Mrs. Barry were over that affair,\u201d concluded Anne, with reminiscent laughter.", "29": "The woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas, threaded with gossamers. Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and a maple-fringed, sun-warm valley they found the \u201csomething\u201d Gilbert was looking for.", "30": "\u201cAh, here it is,\u201d he said with satisfaction.", "31": "\u201cAn apple tree\u2014and away back here!\u201d exclaimed Anne delightedly.", "32": "\u201cYes, a veritable apple-bearing apple tree, too, here in the very midst of pines and beeches, a mile away from any orchard. I was here one day last spring and found it, all white with blossom. So I resolved I\u2019d come again in the fall and see if it had been apples. See, it\u2019s loaded. They look good, too\u2014tawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek. Most wild seedlings are green and uninviting.\u201d", "33": "\u201cI suppose it sprang years ago from some chance-sown seed,\u201d said Anne dreamily. \u201cAnd how it has grown and flourished and held its own here all alone among aliens, the brave determined thing!\u201d", "34": "\u201cHere\u2019s a fallen tree with a cushion of moss. Sit down, Anne\u2014it will serve for a woodland throne. I\u2019ll climb for some apples. They all grow high\u2014the tree had to reach up to the sunlight.\u201d", "35": "The apples proved to be delicious. Under the tawny skin was a white, white flesh, faintly veined with red; and, besides their own proper apple taste, they had a certain wild, delightful tang no orchard-grown apple ever possessed.", "36": "\u201cThe fatal apple of Eden couldn\u2019t have had a rarer flavor,\u201d commented Anne. \u201cBut it\u2019s time we were going home. See, it was twilight three minutes ago and now it\u2019s moonlight. What a pity we couldn\u2019t have caught the moment of transformation. But such moments never are caught, I suppose.\u201d", "37": "\u201cLet\u2019s go back around the marsh and home by way of Lover\u2019s Lane. Do you feel as disgruntled now as when you started out, Anne?\u201d", "38": "\u201cNot I. Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul. I feel that I shall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there.\u201d", "39": "\u201cAnd after those four years\u2014what?\u201d", "40": "\u201cOh, there\u2019s another bend in the road at their end,\u201d answered Anne lightly. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what may be around it\u2014I don\u2019t want to have. It\u2019s nicer not to know.\u201d", "41": "Lover\u2019s Lane was a dear place that night, still and mysteriously dim in the pale radiance of the moonlight. They loitered through it in a pleasant chummy silence, neither caring to talk.", "42": "\u201cIf Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple everything would be,\u201d reflected Anne.", "43": "Gilbert was looking at Anne, as she walked along. In her light dress, with her slender delicacy, she made him think of a white iris.", "44": "\u201cI wonder if I can ever make her care for me,\u201d he thought, with a pang of self-distrust."}, "Chapter III": {"0": "Charlie Sloane, Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley left Avonlea the following Monday morning. Anne had hoped for a fine day. Diana was to drive her to the station and they wanted this, their last drive together for some time, to be a pleasant one. But when Anne went to bed Sunday night the east wind was moaning around Green Gables with an ominous prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning. Anne awoke to find raindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the pond\u2019s gray surface with widening rings; hills and sea were hidden in mist, and the whole world seemed dim and dreary. Anne dressed in the cheerless gray dawn, for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train; she struggled against the tears that WOULD well up in her eyes in spite of herself. She was leaving the home that was so dear to her, and something told her that she was leaving it forever, save as a holiday refuge. Things would never be the same again; coming back for vacations would not be living there. And oh, how dear and beloved everything was\u2014that little white porch room, sacred to the dreams of girlhood, the old Snow Queen at the window, the brook in the hollow, the Dryad\u2019s Bubble, the Haunted Woods, and Lover\u2019s Lane\u2014all the thousand and one dear spots where memories of the old years bided. Could she ever be really happy anywhere else?", "1": "Breakfast at Green Gables that morning was a rather doleful meal. Davy, for the first time in his life probably, could not eat, but blubbered shamelessly over his porridge. Nobody else seemed to have much appetite, save Dora, who tucked away her rations comfortably. Dora, like the immortal and most prudent Charlotte, who \u201cwent on cutting bread and butter\u201d when her frenzied lover\u2019s body had been carried past on a shutter, was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom disturbed by anything. Even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle Dora\u2019s placidity. She was sorry Anne was going away, of course, but was that any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on toast? Not at all. And, seeing that Davy could not eat his, Dora ate it for him.", "2": "Promptly on time Diana appeared with horse and buggy, her rosy face glowing above her raincoat. The good-byes had to be said then somehow. Mrs. Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and warn her to be careful of her health, whatever she did. Marilla, brusque and tearless, pecked Anne\u2019s cheek and said she supposed they\u2019d hear from her when she got settled. A casual observer might have concluded that Anne\u2019s going mattered very little to her\u2014unless said observer had happened to get a good look in her eyes. Dora kissed Anne primly and squeezed out two decorous little tears; but Davy, who had been crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table, refused to say good-bye at all. When he saw Anne coming towards him he sprang to his feet, bolted up the back stairs, and hid in a clothes closet, out of which he would not come. His muffled howls were the last sounds Anne heard as she left Green Gables.", "3": "It rained heavily all the way to Bright River, to which station they had to go, since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect with the boat train. Charlie and Gilbert were on the station platform when they reached it, and the train was whistling. Anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check, say a hurried farewell to Diana, and hasten on board. She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea; she knew she was going to die of homesickness. And oh, if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed! Even Gilbert\u2019s presence brought her no comfort, for Charlie Sloane was there, too, and Sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather. It was absolutely insufferable in rain.", "4": "But when the boat steamed out of Charlottetown harbor things took a turn for the better. The rain ceased and the sun began to burst out goldenly now and again between the rents in the clouds, burnishing the gray seas with copper-hued radiance, and lighting up the mists that curtained the Island\u2019s red shores with gleams of gold foretokening a fine day after all. Besides, Charlie Sloane promptly became so seasick that he had to go below, and Anne and Gilbert were left alone on deck.", "5": "\u201cI am very glad that all the Sloanes get seasick as soon as they go on water,\u201d thought Anne mercilessly. \u201cI am sure I couldn\u2019t take my farewell look at the \u2018ould sod\u2019 with Charlie standing there pretending to look sentimentally at it, too.\u201d", "6": "\u201cWell, we\u2019re off,\u201d remarked Gilbert unsentimentally.", "7": "\u201cYes, I feel like Byron\u2019s \u2018Childe Harold\u2019\u2014only it isn\u2019t really my \u2018native shore\u2019 that I\u2019m watching,\u201d said Anne, winking her gray eyes vigorously. \u201cNova Scotia is that, I suppose. But one\u2019s native shore is the land one loves the best, and that\u2019s good old P.E.I. for me. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t always live here. Those eleven years before I came seem like a bad dream. It\u2019s seven years since I crossed on this boat\u2014the evening Mrs. Spencer brought me over from Hopetown. I can see myself, in that dreadful old wincey dress and faded sailor hat, exploring decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity. It was a fine evening; and how those red Island shores did gleam in the sunshine. Now I\u2019m crossing the strait again. Oh, Gilbert, I do hope I\u2019ll like Redmond and Kingsport, but I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t!\u201d", "8": "\u201cWhere\u2019s all your philosophy gone, Anne?\u201d", "9": "\u201cIt\u2019s all submerged under a great, swamping wave of loneliness and homesickness.

I MUST have that, \u2018as a went\u2019\u2014and I\u2019ll have to wait until I get into my boardinghouse bed tonight, wherever it may be, before I can have it. Then Anne will be herself again.

Oh, yes, the boardinghouse\u2014it\u2019s really a very nice place of its kind, as you\u2019ll admit tomorrow morning when a good night\u2019s sleep has turned your blues rosy pink. It\u2019s a big, old-fashioned, gray stone house on St. John Street, just a nice little constitutional from Redmond. It used to be the \u2018residence\u2019 of great folk, but fashion has deserted St. John Street and its houses only dream now of better days. They\u2019re so big that people living in them have to take boarders just to fill up. At least, that is the reason our landladies are very anxious to impress on us. They\u2019re delicious, Anne\u2014our landladies, I mean.\u201d", "18": "\u201cHow many are there?\u201d", "19": "\u201cTwo. Miss Hannah Harvey and Miss Ada Harvey. They were born twins about fifty years ago.\u201d", "20": "\u201cI can\u2019t get away from twins, it seems,\u201d smiled Anne. \u201cWherever I go they confront me.\u201d", "21": "\u201cOh, they\u2019re not twins now, dear. After they reached the age of thirty they never were twins again. Miss Hannah has grown old, not too gracefully, and Miss Ada has stayed thirty, less gracefully still. I don\u2019t know whether Miss Hannah can smile or not; I\u2019ve never caught her at it so far, but Miss Ada smiles all the time and that\u2019s worse. However, they\u2019re nice, kind souls, and they take two boarders every year because Miss Hannah\u2019s economical soul cannot bear to \u2018waste room space\u2019\u2014not because they need to or have to, as Miss Ada has told me seven times since Saturday night. As for our rooms, I admit they are hall bedrooms, and mine does look out on the back yard. Your room is a front one and looks out on Old St. John\u2019s graveyard, which is just across the street.\u201d", "22": "\u201cThat sounds gruesome,\u201d shivered Anne. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather have the back yard view.\u201d", "23": "\u201cOh, no, you wouldn\u2019t. Wait and see. Old St. John\u2019s is a darling place. It\u2019s been a graveyard so long that it\u2019s ceased to be one and has become one of the sights of Kingsport. I was all through it yesterday for a pleasure exertion. There\u2019s a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees all around it, and rows of trees all through it, and the queerest old tombstones, with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions. You\u2019ll go there to study, Anne, see if you don\u2019t. Of course, nobody is ever buried there now. But a few years ago they put up a beautiful monument to the memory of Nova Scotian soldiers who fell in the Crimean War. It is just opposite the entrance gates and there\u2019s \u2018scope for imagination\u2019 in it, as you used to say. Here\u2019s your trunk at last\u2014and the boys coming to say good night. Must I really shake hands with Charlie Sloane, Anne? His hands are always so cold and fishy-feeling. We must ask them to call occasionally. Miss Hannah gravely told me we could have \u2018young gentlemen callers\u2019 two evenings in the week, if they went away at a reasonable hour; and Miss Ada asked me, smiling, please to be sure they didn\u2019t sit on her beautiful cushions. I promised to see to it; but goodness knows where else they CAN sit, unless they sit on the floor, for there are cushions on EVERYTHING. Miss Ada even has an elaborate Battenburg one on top of the piano.\u201d", "24": "Anne was laughing by this time. Priscilla\u2019s gay chatter had the intended effect of cheering her up; homesickness vanished for the time being, and did not even return in full force when she finally found herself alone in her little bedroom. She went to her window and looked out. The street below was dim and quiet. Across it the moon was shining above the trees in Old St. John\u2019s, just behind the great dark head of the lion on the monument. Anne wondered if it could have been only that morning that she had left Green Gables. She had the sense of a long passage of time which one day of change and travel gives.", "25": "\u201cI suppose that very moon is looking down on Green Gables now,\u201d she mused. \u201cBut I won\u2019t think about it\u2014that way homesickness lies. I\u2019m not even going to have my good cry. I\u2019ll put that off to a more convenient season, and just now I\u2019ll go calmly and sensibly to bed and to sleep.\u201d"}, "Chapter IV": {"0": "Kingsport is a quaint old town, hearking back to early Colonial days, and wrapped in its ancient atmosphere, as some fine old dame in garments fashioned like those of her youth. Here and there it sprouts out into modernity, but at heart it is still unspoiled; it is full of curious relics, and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past. Once it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness, and those were the days when Indians kept life from being monotonous to the settlers. Then it grew to be a bone of contention between the British and the French, being occupied now by the one and now by the other, emerging from each occupation with some fresh scar of battling nations branded on it.", "1": "It has in its park a martello tower, autographed all over by tourists, a dismantled old French fort on the hills beyond the town, and several antiquated cannon in its public squares. It has other historic spots also, which may be hunted out by the curious, and none is more quaint and delightful than Old St. John\u2019s Cemetery at the very core of the town, with streets of quiet, old-time houses on two sides, and busy, bustling, modern thoroughfares on the others. Every citizen of Kingsport feels a thrill of possessive pride in Old St. John\u2019s, for, if he be of any pretensions at all, he has an ancestor buried there, with a queer, crooked slab at his head, or else sprawling protectively over the grave, on which all the main facts of his history are recorded. For the most part no great art or skill was lavished on those old tombstones. The larger number are of roughly chiselled brown or gray native stone, and only in a few cases is there any attempt at ornamentation. Some are adorned with skull and cross-bones, and this grizzly decoration is frequently coupled with a cherub\u2019s head. Many are prostrate and in ruins. Into almost all Time\u2019s tooth has been gnawing, until some inscriptions have been completely effaced, and others can only be deciphered with difficulty. The graveyard is very full and very bowery, for it is surrounded and intersected by rows of elms and willows, beneath whose shade the sleepers must lie very dreamlessly, forever crooned to by the winds and leaves over them, and quite undisturbed by the clamor of traffic just beyond.", "2": "Anne took the first of many rambles in Old St. John\u2019s the next afternoon. She and Priscilla had gone to Redmond in the forenoon and registered as students, after which there was nothing more to do that day. The girls gladly made their escape, for it was not exhilarating to be surrounded by crowds of strangers, most of whom had a rather alien appearance, as if not quite sure where they belonged.", "3": "The \u201cfreshettes\u201d stood about in detached groups of two or three, looking askance at each other; the \u201cfreshies,\u201d wiser in their day and generation, had banded themselves together on the big staircase of the entrance hall, where they were shouting out glees with all the vigor of youthful lungs, as a species of defiance to their traditional enemies, the Sophomores, a few of whom were prowling loftily about, looking properly disdainful of the \u201cunlicked cubs\u201d on the stairs. Gilbert and Charlie were nowhere to be seen.", "4": "\u201cLittle did I think the day would ever come when I\u2019d be glad of the sight of a Sloane,\u201d said Priscilla, as they crossed the campus, \u201cbut I\u2019d welcome Charlie\u2019s goggle eyes almost ecstatically. At least, they\u2019d be familiar eyes.\u201d", "5": "\u201cOh,\u201d sighed Anne. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how I felt when I was standing there, waiting my turn to be registered\u2014as insignificant as the teeniest drop in a most enormous bucket. It\u2019s bad enough to feel insignificant, but it\u2019s unbearable to have it grained into your soul that you will never, can never, be anything but insignificant, and that is how I did feel\u2014as if I were invisible to the naked eye and some of those Sophs might step on me. I knew I would go down to my grave unwept, unhonored and unsung.\u201d", "6": "\u201cWait till next year,\u201d comforted Priscilla. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be able to look as bored and sophisticated as any Sophomore of them all. No doubt it is rather dreadful to feel insignificant; but I think it\u2019s better than to feel as big and awkward as I did\u2014as if I were sprawled all over Redmond. That\u2019s how I felt\u2014I suppose because I was a good two inches taller than any one else in the crowd. I wasn\u2019t afraid a Soph might walk over me; I was afraid they\u2019d take me for an elephant, or an overgrown sample of a potato-fed Islander.\u201d", "7": "\u201cI suppose the trouble is we can\u2019t forgive big Redmond for not being little Queen\u2019s,\u201d said Anne, gathering about her the shreds of her old cheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit. \u201cWhen we left Queen\u2019s we knew everybody and had a place of our own. I suppose we have been unconsciously expecting to take life up at Redmond just where we left off at Queen\u2019s, and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from under our feet. I\u2019m thankful that neither Mrs. Lynde nor Mrs. Elisha Wright know, or ever will know, my state of mind at present. They would exult in saying \u2018I told you so,\u2019 and be convinced it was the beginning of the end. Whereas it is just the end of the beginning.\u201d", "8": "\u201cExactly. That sounds more Anneish. In a little while we\u2019ll be acclimated and acquainted, and all will be well. Anne, did you notice the girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds\u2019 dressing room all the morning\u2014the pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked mouth?\u201d", "9": "\u201cYes, I did. I noticed her particularly because she seemed the only creature there who LOOKED as lonely and friendless as I FELT. I had YOU, but she had no one.\u201d", "10": "\u201cI think she felt pretty all-by-herselfish, too. Several times I saw her make a motion as if to cross over to us, but she never did it\u2014too shy, I suppose. I wished she would come. If I hadn\u2019t felt so much like the aforesaid elephant I\u2019d have gone to her. But I couldn\u2019t lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs. She was the prettiest freshette I saw today, but probably favor is deceitful and even beauty is vain on your first day at Redmond,\u201d concluded Priscilla with a laugh.", "11": "\u201cI\u2019m going across to Old St. John\u2019s after lunch,\u201d said Anne. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a graveyard is a very good place to go to get cheered up, but it seems the only get-at-able place where there are trees, and trees I must have. I\u2019ll sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and imagine I\u2019m in the Avonlea woods.\u201d", "12": "Anne did not do that, however, for she found enough of interest in Old St. John\u2019s to keep her eyes wide open. They went in by the entrance gates, past the simple, massive, stone arch surmounted by the great lion of England.", "13": "quoted Anne, looking at it with a thrill. They found themselves in a dim, cool, green place where winds were fond of purring. Up and down the long grassy aisles they wandered, reading the quaint, voluminous epitaphs, carved in an age that had more leisure than our own.", "14": "\u201c\u2018Here lieth the body of Albert Crawford, Esq.,\u2019\u201d read Anne from a worn, gray slab, \u201c\u2018for many years Keeper of His Majesty\u2019s Ordnance at Kingsport. He served in the army till the peace of 1763, when he retired from bad health. He was a brave officer, the best of husbands, the best of fathers, the best of friends. He died October 29th, 1792, aged 84 years.\u2019 There\u2019s an epitaph for you, Prissy. There is certainly some \u2018scope for imagination\u2019 in it. How full such a life must have been of adventure! And as for his personal qualities, I\u2019m sure human eulogy couldn\u2019t go further. I wonder if they told him he was all those best things while he was alive.\u201d", "15": "\u201cHere\u2019s another,\u201d said Priscilla. \u201cListen\u2014", "16": "\u2018To the memory of Alexander Ross, who died on the 22nd of September, 1840, aged 43 years. This is raised as a tribute of affection by one whom he served so faithfully for 27 years that he was regarded as a friend, deserving the fullest confidence and attachment.\u2019\u201d", "17": "\u201cA very good epitaph,\u201d commented Anne thoughtfully. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish a better. We are all servants of some sort, and if the fact that we are faithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more need be added. Here\u2019s a sorrowful little gray stone, Prissy\u2014\u2018to the memory of a favorite child.\u2019 And here is another \u2018erected to the memory of one who is buried elsewhere.\u2019 I wonder where that unknown grave is. Really, Pris, the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as this. You were right\u2014I shall come here often. I love it already. I see we\u2019re not alone here\u2014there\u2019s a girl down at the end of this avenue.\u201d", "18": "\u201cYes, and I believe it\u2019s the very girl we saw at Redmond this morning. I\u2019ve been watching her for five minutes. She has started to come up the avenue exactly half a dozen times, and half a dozen times has she turned and gone back. Either she\u2019s dreadfully shy or she has got something on her conscience. Let\u2019s go and meet her. It\u2019s easier to get acquainted in a graveyard than at Redmond, I believe.\u201d", "19": "They walked down the long grassy arcade towards the stranger, who was sitting on a gray slab under an enormous willow. She was certainly very pretty, with a vivid, irregular, bewitching type of prettiness. There was a gloss as of brown nuts on her satin-smooth hair and a soft, ripe glow on her round cheeks. Her eyes were big and brown and velvety, under oddly-pointed black brows, and her crooked mouth was rose-red. She wore a smart brown suit, with two very modish little shoes peeping from beneath it; and her hat of dull pink straw, wreathed with golden-brown poppies, had the indefinable, unmistakable air which pertains to the \u201ccreation\u201d of an artist in millinery. Priscilla had a sudden stinging consciousness that her own hat had been trimmed by her village store milliner, and Anne wondered uncomfortably if the blouse she had made herself, and which Mrs. Lynde had fitted, looked VERY countrified and home-made besides the stranger\u2019s smart attire. For a moment both girls felt like turning back.", "20": "But they had already stopped and turned towards the gray slab. It was too late to retreat, for the brown-eyed girl had evidently concluded that they were coming to speak to her. Instantly she sprang up and came forward with outstretched hand and a gay, friendly smile in which there seemed not a shadow of either shyness or burdened conscience.", "21": "\u201cOh, I want to know who you two girls are,\u201d she exclaimed eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve been DYING to know. I saw you at Redmond this morning. Say, wasn\u2019t it AWFUL there? For the time I wished I had stayed home and got married.\u201d", "22": "Anne and Priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter at this unexpected conclusion. The brown-eyed girl laughed, too.", "23": "\u201cI really did. I COULD have, you know. Come, let\u2019s all sit down on this gravestone and get acquainted. It won\u2019t be hard. I know we\u2019re going to adore each other\u2014I knew it as soon as I saw you at Redmond this morning. I wanted so much to go right over and hug you both.\u201d", "24": "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d asked Priscilla.", "25": "\u201cBecause I simply couldn\u2019t make up my mind to do it. I never can make up my mind about anything myself\u2014I\u2019m always afflicted with indecision. Just as soon as I decide to do something I feel in my bones that another course would be the correct one. It\u2019s a dreadful misfortune, but I was born that way, and there is no use in blaming me for it, as some people do. So I couldn\u2019t make up my mind to go and speak to you, much as I wanted to.\u201d", "26": "\u201cWe thought you were too shy,\u201d said Anne.", "27": "\u201cNo, no, dear. Shyness isn\u2019t among the many failings\u2014or virtues\u2014of Philippa Gordon\u2014Phil for short. Do call me Phil right off. Now, what are your handles?\u201d", "28": "\u201cShe\u2019s Priscilla Grant,\u201d said Anne, pointing.", "29": "\u201cAnd SHE\u2019S Anne Shirley,\u201d said Priscilla, pointing in turn.", "30": "\u201cAnd we\u2019re from the Island,\u201d said both together.", "31": "\u201cI hail from Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia,\u201d said Philippa.", "32": "\u201cBolingbroke!\u201d exclaimed Anne. \u201cWhy, that is where I was born.\u201d", "33": "\u201cDo you really mean it? Why, that makes you a Bluenose after all.\u201d", "34": "\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d retorted Anne. \u201cWasn\u2019t it Dan O\u2019Connell who said that if a man was born in a stable it didn\u2019t make him a horse? I\u2019m Island to the core.\u201d", "35": "\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you were born in Bolingbroke anyway. It makes us kind of neighbors, doesn\u2019t it? And I like that, because when I tell you secrets it won\u2019t be as if I were telling them to a stranger. I have to tell them. I can\u2019t keep secrets\u2014it\u2019s no use to try. That\u2019s my worst failing\u2014that, and indecision, as aforesaid. Would you believe it?\u2014it took me half an hour to decide which hat to wear when I was coming here\u2014HERE, to a graveyard! At first I inclined to my brown one with the feather; but as soon as I put it on I thought this pink one with the floppy brim would be more becoming. When I got IT pinned in place I liked the brown one better. At last I put them close together on the bed, shut my eyes, and jabbed with a hat pin. The pin speared the pink one, so I put it on. It is becoming, isn\u2019t it? Tell me, what do you think of my looks?\u201d", "36": "At this naive demand, made in a perfectly serious tone, Priscilla laughed again. But Anne said, impulsively squeezing Philippa\u2019s hand,", "37": "\u201cWe thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at Redmond.\u201d", "38": "Philippa\u2019s crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching, crooked smile over very white little teeth.", "39": "\u201cI thought that myself,\u201d was her next astounding statement, \u201cbut I wanted some one else\u2019s opinion to bolster mine up. I can\u2019t decide even on my own appearance. Just as soon as I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m pretty I begin to feel miserably that I\u2019m not. Besides, have a horrible old great-aunt who is always saying to me, with a mournful sigh, \u2018You were such a pretty baby. It\u2019s strange how children change when they grow up.\u2019 I adore aunts, but I detest great-aunts. Please tell me quite often that I am pretty, if you don\u2019t mind. I feel so much more comfortable when I can believe I\u2019m pretty. And I\u2019ll be just as obliging to you if you want me to\u2014I CAN be, with a clear conscience.\u201d", "40": "\u201cThanks,\u201d laughed Anne, \u201cbut Priscilla and I are so firmly convinced of our own good looks that we don\u2019t need any assurance about them, so you needn\u2019t trouble.\u201d", "41": "\u201cOh, you\u2019re laughing at me. I know you think I\u2019m abominably vain, but I\u2019m not. There really isn\u2019t one spark of vanity in me. And I\u2019m never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them. I\u2019m so glad I know you folks. I came up on Saturday and I\u2019ve nearly died of homesickness ever since. It\u2019s a horrible feeling, isn\u2019t it? In Bolingbroke I\u2019m an important personage, and in Kingsport I\u2019m just nobody! There were times when I could feel my soul turning a delicate blue. Where do you hang out?\u201d", "42": "\u201cThirty-eight St. John\u2019s Street.\u201d", "43": "\u201cBetter and better. Why, I\u2019m just around the corner on Wallace Street. I don\u2019t like my boardinghouse, though. It\u2019s bleak and lonesome, and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard. It\u2019s the ugliest place in the world. As for cats\u2014well, surely ALL the Kingsport cats can\u2019t congregate there at night, but half of them must. I adore cats on hearth rugs, snoozing before nice, friendly fires, but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals. The first night I was here I cried all night, and so did the cats. You should have seen my nose in the morning. How I wished I had never left home!\u201d", "44": "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you managed to make up your mind to come to Redmond at all, if you are really such an undecided person,\u201d said amused Priscilla.", "45": "\u201cBless your heart, honey, I didn\u2019t. It was father who wanted me to come here. His heart was set on it\u2014why, I don\u2019t know. It seems perfectly ridiculous to think of me studying for a B.A. degree, doesn\u2019t it? Not but what I can do it, all right. I have heaps of brains.\u201d", "46": "\u201cOh!\u201d said Priscilla vaguely.", "47": "\u201cYes. But it\u2019s such hard work to use them. And B.A.\u2018s are such learned, dignified, wise, solemn creatures\u2014they must be. No, I didn\u2019t want to come to Redmond. I did it just to oblige father. He IS such a duck. Besides, I knew if I stayed home I\u2019d have to get married. Mother wanted that\u2014wanted it decidedly. Mother has plenty of decision. But I really hated the thought of being married for a few years yet. I want to have heaps of fun before I settle down. And, ridiculous as the idea of my being a B.A. is, the idea of my being an old married woman is still more absurd, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m only eighteen. No, I concluded I would rather come to Redmond than be married. Besides, how could I ever have made up my mind which man to marry?\u201d", "48": "\u201cWere there so many?\u201d laughed Anne.", "49": "\u201cHeaps. The boys like me awfully\u2014they really do. But there were only two that mattered. The rest were all too young and too poor. I must marry a rich man, you know.\u201d", "50": "\u201cWhy must you?\u201d", "51": "\u201cHoney, you couldn\u2019t imagine ME being a poor man\u2019s wife, could you? I can\u2019t do a single useful thing, and I am VERY extravagant. Oh, no, my husband must have heaps of money. So that narrowed them down to two. But I couldn\u2019t decide between two any easier than between two hundred. I knew perfectly well that whichever one I chose I\u2019d regret all my life that I hadn\u2019t married the other.\u201d", "52": "\u201cDidn\u2019t you\u2014love\u2014either of them?\u201d asked Anne, a little hesitatingly. It was not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and transformation of life.", "53": "\u201cGoodness, no. I couldn\u2019t love anybody. It isn\u2019t in me. Besides I wouldn\u2019t want to. Being in love makes you a perfect slave, I think. And it would give a man such power to hurt you. I\u2019d be afraid. No, no, Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys, and I like them both so much that I really don\u2019t know which I like the better. That is the trouble. Alec is the best looking, of course, and I simply couldn\u2019t marry a man who wasn\u2019t handsome. He is good-tempered too, and has lovely, curly, black hair. He\u2019s rather too perfect\u2014I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d like a perfect husband\u2014somebody I could never find fault with.\u201d", "54": "\u201cThen why not marry Alonzo?\u201d asked Priscilla gravely.", "55": "\u201cThink of marrying a name like Alonzo!\u201d said Phil dolefully. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could endure it. But he has a classic nose, and it WOULD be a comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on. I can\u2019t depend on mine. So far, it takes after the Gordon pattern, but I\u2019m so afraid it will develop Byrne tendencies as I grow older. I examine it every day anxiously to make sure it\u2019s still Gordon. Mother was a Byrne and has the Byrne nose in the Byrnest degree. Wait till you see it. I adore nice noses. Your nose is awfully nice, Anne Shirley. Alonzo\u2019s nose nearly turned the balance in his favor. But ALONZO! No, I couldn\u2019t decide. If I could have done as I did with the hats\u2014stood them both up together, shut my eyes, and jabbed with a hatpin\u2014it would have been quite easy.\u201d", "56": "\u201cWhat did Alec and Alonzo feel like when you came away?\u201d queried Priscilla.", "57": "\u201cOh, they still have hope. I told them they\u2019d have to wait till I could make up my mind. They\u2019re quite willing to wait. They both worship me, you know. Meanwhile, I intend to have a good time. I expect I shall have heaps of beaux at Redmond. I can\u2019t be happy unless I have, you know. But don\u2019t you think the freshmen are fearfully homely? I saw only one really handsome fellow among them. He went away before you came. I heard his chum call him Gilbert. His chum had eyes that stuck out THAT FAR. But you\u2019re not going yet, girls? Don\u2019t go yet.\u201d", "58": "\u201cI think we must,\u201d said Anne, rather coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019ve some work to do.\u201d", "59": "\u201cBut you\u2019ll both come to see me, won\u2019t you?\u201d asked Philippa, getting up and putting an arm around each. \u201cAnd let me come to see you. I want to be chummy with you. I\u2019ve taken such a fancy to you both. And I haven\u2019t quite disgusted you with my frivolity, have I?\u201d", "60": "\u201cNot quite,\u201d laughed Anne, responding to Phil\u2019s squeeze, with a return of cordiality.", "61": "\u201cBecause I\u2019m not half so silly as I seem on the surface, you know. You just accept Philippa Gordon, as the Lord made her, with all her faults, and I believe you\u2019ll come to like her. Isn\u2019t this graveyard a sweet place? I\u2019d love to be buried here. Here\u2019s a grave I didn\u2019t see before\u2014this one in the iron railing\u2014oh, girls, look, see\u2014the stone says it\u2019s the grave of a middy who was killed in the fight between the Shannon and the Chesapeake. Just fancy!\u201d", "62": "Anne paused by the railing and looked at the worn stone, her pulses thrilling with sudden excitement. The old graveyard, with its over-arching trees and long aisles of shadows, faded from her sight. Instead, she saw the Kingsport Harbor of nearly a century agone. Out of the mist came slowly a great frigate, brilliant with \u201cthe meteor flag of England.\u201d Behind her was another, with a still, heroic form, wrapped in his own starry flag, lying on the quarter deck\u2014the gallant Lawrence. Time\u2019s finger had turned back his pages, and that was the Shannon sailing triumphant up the bay with the Chesapeake as her prize.", "63": "\u201cCome back, Anne Shirley\u2014come back,\u201d laughed Philippa, pulling her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re a hundred years away from us. Come back.\u201d", "64": "Anne came back with a sigh; her eyes were shining softly.", "65": "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved that old story,\u201d she said, \u201cand although the English won that victory, I think it was because of the brave, defeated commander I love it. This grave seems to bring it so near and make it so real. This poor little middy was only eighteen. He \u2018died of desperate wounds received in gallant action\u2019\u2014so reads his epitaph. It is such as a soldier might wish for.\u201d", "66": "Before she turned away, Anne unpinned the little cluster of purple pansies she wore and dropped it softly on the grave of the boy who had perished in the great sea-duel.", "67": "\u201cWell, what do you think of our new friend?\u201d asked Priscilla, when Phil had left them.", "68": "\u201cI like her. There is something very lovable about her, in spite of all her nonsense. I believe, as she says herself, that she isn\u2019t half as silly as she sounds. She\u2019s a dear, kissable baby\u2014and I don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll ever really grow up.\u201d", "69": "\u201cI like her, too,\u201d said Priscilla, decidedly. \u201cShe talks as much about boys as Ruby Gillis does. But it always enrages or sickens me to hear Ruby, whereas I just wanted to laugh good-naturedly at Phil. Now, what is the why of that?\u201d", "70": "\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d said Anne meditatively. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Ruby is really so CONSCIOUS of boys. She plays at love and love-making. Besides, you feel, when she is boasting of her beaux that she is doing it to rub it well into you that you haven\u2019t half so many. Now, when Phil talks of her beaux it sounds as if she was just speaking of chums. She really looks upon boys as good comrades, and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round, simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular. Even Alex and Alonzo\u2014I\u2019ll never be able to think of those two names separately after this\u2014are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives. I\u2019m glad we met her, and I\u2019m glad we went to Old St. John\u2019s. I believe I\u2019ve put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil this afternoon. I hope so. I hate to feel transplanted.\u201d"}, "Chapter V": {"0": "For the next three weeks Anne and Priscilla continued to feel as strangers in a strange land. Then, suddenly, everything seemed to fall into focus\u2014Redmond, professors, classes, students, studies, social doings. Life became homogeneous again, instead of being made up of detached fragments. The Freshmen, instead of being a collection of unrelated individuals, found themselves a class, with a class spirit, a class yell, class interests, class antipathies and class ambitions. They won the day in the annual \u201cArts Rush\u201d against the Sophomores, and thereby gained the respect of all the classes, and an enormous, confidence-giving opinion of themselves. For three years the Sophomores had won in the \u201crush\u201d; that the victory of this year perched upon the Freshmen\u2019s banner was attributed to the strategic generalship of Gilbert Blythe, who marshalled the campaign and originated certain new tactics, which demoralized the Sophs and swept the Freshmen to triumph. As a reward of merit he was elected president of the Freshman Class, a position of honor and responsibility\u2014from a Fresh point of view, at least\u2014coveted by many. He was also invited to join the \u201cLambs\u201d\u2014Redmondese for Lamba Theta\u2014a compliment rarely paid to a Freshman. As a preparatory initiation ordeal he had to parade the principal business streets of Kingsport for a whole day wearing a sunbonnet and a voluminous kitchen apron of gaudily flowered calico. This he did cheerfully, doffing his sunbonnet with courtly grace when he met ladies of his acquaintance. Charlie Sloane, who had not been asked to join the Lambs, told Anne he did not see how Blythe could do it, and HE, for his part, could never humiliate himself so.", "1": "\u201cFancy Charlie Sloane in a \u2018caliker\u2019 apron and a \u2018sunbunnit,\u2019\u201d giggled Priscilla. \u201cHe\u2019d look exactly like his old Grandmother Sloane. Gilbert, now, looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper habiliments.\u201d", "2": "Anne and Priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of Redmond. That this came about so speedily was due in great measure to Philippa Gordon. Philippa was the daughter of a rich and well-known man, and belonged to an old and exclusive \u201cBluenose\u201d family. This, combined with her beauty and charm\u2014a charm acknowledged by all who met her\u2014promptly opened the gates of all cliques, clubs and classes in Redmond to her; and where she went Anne and Priscilla went, too. Phil \u201cadored\u201d Anne and Priscilla, especially Anne. She was a loyal little soul, crystal-free from any form of snobbishness. \u201cLove me, love my friends\u201d seemed to be her unconscious motto. Without effort, she took them with her into her ever widening circle of acquaintanceship, and the two Avonlea girls found their social pathway at Redmond made very easy and pleasant for them, to the envy and wonderment of the other freshettes, who, lacking Philippa\u2019s sponsorship, were doomed to remain rather on the fringe of things during their first college year.", "3": "To Anne and Priscilla, with their more serious views of life, Phil remained the amusing, lovable baby she had seemed on their first meeting. Yet, as she said herself, she had \u201cheaps\u201d of brains. When or where she found time to study was a mystery, for she seemed always in demand for some kind of \u201cfun,\u201d and her home evenings were crowded with callers. She had all the \u201cbeaux\u201d that heart could desire, for nine-tenths of the Freshmen and a big fraction of all the other classes were rivals for her smiles. She was naively delighted over this, and gleefully recounted each new conquest to Anne and Priscilla, with comments that might have made the unlucky lover\u2019s ears burn fiercely.", "4": "\u201cAlec and Alonzo don\u2019t seem to have any serious rival yet,\u201d remarked Anne, teasingly.", "5": "\u201cNot one,\u201d agreed Philippa. \u201cI write them both every week and tell them all about my young men here. I\u2019m sure it must amuse them. But, of course, the one I like best I can\u2019t get. Gilbert Blythe won\u2019t take any notice of me, except to look at me as if I were a nice little kitten he\u2019d like to pat. Too well I know the reason. I owe you a grudge, Queen Anne. I really ought to hate you and instead I love you madly, and I\u2019m miserable if I don\u2019t see you every day. You\u2019re different from any girl I ever knew before. When you look at me in a certain way I feel what an insignificant, frivolous little beast I am, and I long to be better and wiser and stronger. And then I make good resolutions; but the first nice-looking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head. Isn\u2019t college life magnificent? It\u2019s so funny to think I hated it that first day. But if I hadn\u2019t I might never got really acquainted with you. Anne, please tell me over again that you like me a little bit. I yearn to hear it.\u201d", "6": "\u201cI like you a big bit\u2014and I think you\u2019re a dear, sweet, adorable, velvety, clawless, little\u2014kitten,\u201d laughed Anne, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see when you ever get time to learn your lessons.\u201d", "7": "Phil must have found time for she held her own in every class of her year. Even the grumpy old professor of Mathematics, who detested coeds, and had bitterly opposed their admission to Redmond, couldn\u2019t floor her. She led the freshettes everywhere, except in English, where Anne Shirley left her far behind. Anne herself found the studies of her Freshman year very easy, thanks in great part to the steady work she and Gilbert had put in during those two past years in Avonlea. This left her more time for a social life which she thoroughly enjoyed. But never for a moment did she forget Avonlea and the friends there. To her, the happiest moments in each week were those in which letters came from home. It was not until she had got her first letters that she began to think she could ever like Kingsport or feel at home there. Before they came, Avonlea had seemed thousands of miles away; those letters brought it near and linked the old life to the new so closely that they began to seem one and the same, instead of two hopelessly segregated existences. The first batch contained six letters, from Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis, Diana Barry, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde and Davy. Jane\u2019s was a copperplate production, with every \u201ct\u201d nicely crossed and every \u201ci\u201d precisely dotted, and not an interesting sentence in it. She never mentioned the school, concerning which Anne was avid to hear; she never answered one of the questions Anne had asked in her letter. But she told Anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted, and the kind of weather they were having in Avonlea, and how she intended to have her new dress made, and the way she felt when her head ached. Ruby Gillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring Anne\u2019s absence, assuring her she was horribly missed in everything, asking what the Redmond \u201cfellows\u201d were like, and filling the rest with accounts of her own harrowing experiences with her numerous admirers. It was a silly, harmless letter, and Anne would have laughed over it had it not been for the postscript. \u201cGilbert seems to be enjoying Redmond, judging from his letters,\u201d wrote Ruby. \u201cI don\u2019t think Charlie is so stuck on it.\u201d", "8": "So Gilbert was writing to Ruby! Very well. He had a perfect right to, of course. Only\u2014!! Anne did not know that Ruby had written the first letter and that Gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy. She tossed Ruby\u2019s letter aside contemptuously. But it took all Diana\u2019s breezy, newsy, delightful epistle to banish the sting of Ruby\u2019s postscript. Diana\u2019s letter contained a little too much Fred, but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest, and Anne almost felt herself back in Avonlea while reading it. Marilla\u2019s was a rather prim and colorless epistle, severely innocent of gossip or emotion. Yet somehow it conveyed to Anne a whiff of the wholesome, simple life at Green Gables, with its savor of ancient peace, and the steadfast abiding love that was there for her. Mrs. Lynde\u2019s letter was full of church news. Having broken up housekeeping, Mrs. Lynde had more time than ever to devote to church affairs and had flung herself into them heart and soul. She was at present much worked up over the poor \u201csupplies\u201d they were having in the vacant Avonlea pulpit.", "9": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe any but fools enter the ministry nowadays,\u201d she wrote bitterly. \u201cSuch candidates as they have sent us, and such stuff as they preach! Half of it ain\u2019t true, and, what\u2019s worse, it ain\u2019t sound doctrine. The one we have now is the worst of the lot. He mostly takes a text and preaches about something else. And he says he doesn\u2019t believe all the heathen will be eternally lost. The idea! If they won\u2019t all the money we\u2019ve been giving to Foreign Missions will be clean wasted, that\u2019s what! Last Sunday night he announced that next Sunday he\u2019d preach on the axe-head that swam. I think he\u2019d better confine himself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone. Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister can\u2019t find enough in Holy Writ to preach about, that\u2019s what. What church do you attend, Anne? I hope you go regularly. People are apt to get so careless about church-going away from home, and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect. I\u2019m told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday. I hope you\u2019ll never sink that low, Anne. Remember how you were brought up. And be very careful what friends you make. You never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges. Outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves, that\u2019s what. You\u2019d better not have anything to say to any young man who isn\u2019t from the Island.", "10": "\u201cI forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here. It was the funniest thing I ever saw. I said to Marilla, \u2018If Anne had been here wouldn\u2019t she have had a laugh?\u2019 Even Marilla laughed. You know he\u2019s a very short, fat little man with bow legs. Well, that old pig of Mr. Harrison\u2019s\u2014the big, tall one\u2014had wandered over here that day again and broke into the yard, and it got into the back porch, unbeknowns to us, and it was there when the minister appeared in the doorway. It made one wild bolt to get out, but there was nowhere to bolt to except between them bow legs. So there it went, and, being as it was so big and the minister so little, it took him clean off his feet and carried him away. His hat went one way and his cane another, just as Marilla and I got to the door. I\u2019ll never forget the look of him. And that poor pig was near scared to death. I\u2019ll never be able to read that account in the Bible of the swine that rushed madly down the steep place into the sea without seeing Mr. Harrison\u2019s pig careering down the hill with that minister. I guess the pig thought he had the Old Boy on his back instead of inside of him. I was thankful the twins weren\u2019t about. It wouldn\u2019t have been the right thing for them to have seen a minister in such an undignified predicament. Just before they got to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off. The pig rushed through the brook like mad and up through the woods. Marilla and I run down and helped the minister get up and brush his coat. He wasn\u2019t hurt, but he was mad. He seemed to hold Marilla and me responsible for it all, though we told him the pig didn\u2019t belong to us, and had been pestering us all summer. Besides, what did he come to the back door for? You\u2019d never have caught Mr. Allan doing that. It\u2019ll be a long time before we get a man like Mr. Allan. But it\u2019s an ill wind that blows no good. We\u2019ve never seen hoof or hair of that pig since, and it\u2019s my belief we never will.", "11": "\u201cThings is pretty quiet in Avonlea. I don\u2019t find Green Gables as lonesome as I expected. I think I\u2019ll start another cotton warp quilt this winter. Mrs. Silas Sloane has a handsome new apple-leaf pattern.", "12": "\u201cWhen I feel that I must have some excitement I read the murder trials in that Boston paper my niece sends me. I never used to do it, but they\u2019re real interesting. The States must be an awful place. I hope you\u2019ll never go there, Anne. But the way girls roam over the earth now is something terrible. It always makes me think of Satan in the Book of Job, going to and fro and walking up and down. I don\u2019t believe the Lord ever intended it, that\u2019s what.", "13": "\u201cDavy has been pretty good since you went away.

But I couldn\u2019t sew on a day like this. There\u2019s something in the air that gets into my blood and makes a sort of glory in my soul. My fingers would twitch and I\u2019d sew a crooked seam.

Besides, I\u2019ve been feeling a little blue\u2014just a pale, elusive azure. It isn\u2019t serious enough for anything darker. I wrote Alec and Alonzo last week. I put the letters into envelopes and addressed them, but I didn\u2019t seal them up. That evening something funny happened. That is, Alec would think it funny, but Alonzo wouldn\u2019t be likely to. I was in a hurry, so I snatched Alec\u2019s letter\u2014as I thought\u2014out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript. Then I mailed both letters. I got Alonzo\u2019s reply this morning. Girls, I had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious. Of course he\u2019ll get over it\u2014and I don\u2019t care if he doesn\u2019t\u2014but it spoiled my day. So I thought I\u2019d come to you darlings to get cheered up. After the football season opens I won\u2019t have any spare Saturday afternoons. I adore football. I\u2019ve got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond colors to wear to the games. To be sure, a little way off I\u2019ll look like a walking barber\u2019s pole. Do you know that that Gilbert of yours has been elected Captain of the Freshman football team?\u201d", "7": "\u201cYes, he told us so last evening,\u201d said Priscilla, seeing that outraged Anne would not answer. \u201cHe and Charlie were down. We knew they were coming, so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss Ada\u2019s cushions. That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on. I thought it would be safe there. But would you believe it? Charlie Sloane made for that chair, noticed the cushion behind it, solemnly fished it up, and sat on it the whole evening. Such a wreck of a cushion as it was! Poor Miss Ada asked me today, still smiling, but oh, so reproachfully, why I had allowed it to be sat upon. I told her I hadn\u2019t\u2014that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate Sloanishness and I wasn\u2019t a match for both combined.\u201d", "8": "\u201cMiss Ada\u2019s cushions are really getting on my nerves,\u201d said Anne. \u201cShe finished two new ones last week, stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives. There being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing. They topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them. Last Sunday, when Dr. Davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea, I added in thought \u2018and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well!\u2019 There! we\u2019re ready, and I see the boys coming through Old St. John\u2019s. Do you cast in your lot with us, Phil?\u201d", "9": "\u201cI\u2019ll go, if I can walk with Priscilla and Charlie. That will be a bearable degree of gooseberry. That Gilbert of yours is a darling, Anne, but why does he go around so much with Goggle-eyes?\u201d", "10": "Anne stiffened. She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane; but he was of Avonlea, so no outsider had any business to laugh at him.", "11": "\u201cCharlie and Gilbert have always been friends,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cCharlie is a nice boy. He\u2019s not to blame for his eyes.\u201d", "12": "\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that! He is! He must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes.

But Sloane was blissfully ignorant; he thought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds, especially Philippa Gordon, the class beauty and belle. It must surely impress Anne. She would see that some people appreciated him at his real value.", "14": "Gilbert and Anne loitered a little behind the others, enjoying the calm, still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park, on the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore.", "15": "\u201cThe silence here is like a prayer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Anne, her face upturned to the shining sky. \u201cHow I love the pines! They seem to strike their roots deep into the romance of all the ages. It is so comforting to creep away now and then for a good talk with them. I always feel so happy out here.\u201d", "16": "quoted Gilbert.", "17": "\u201cThey make our little ambitions seem rather petty, don\u2019t they, Anne?\u201d", "18": "\u201cI think, if ever any great sorrow came to me, I would come to the pines for comfort,\u201d said Anne dreamily.", "19": "\u201cI hope no great sorrow ever will come to you, Anne,\u201d said Gilbert, who could not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid, joyous creature beside him, unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights can also plunge to the deepest depths, and that the natures which enjoy most keenly are those which also suffer most sharply.", "20": "\u201cBut there must\u2014sometime,\u201d mused Anne. \u201cLife seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now. But there must be some bitterness in it\u2014there is in every cup. I shall taste mine some day. Well, I hope I shall be strong and brave to meet it. And I hope it won\u2019t be through my own fault that it will come. Do you remember what Dr. Davis said last Sunday evening\u2014that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and strength with them, while the sorrows we brought on ourselves, through folly or wickedness, were by far the hardest to bear? But we mustn\u2019t talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this. It\u2019s meant for the sheer joy of living, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "21": "\u201cIf I had my way I\u2019d shut everything out of your life but happiness and pleasure, Anne,\u201d said Gilbert in the tone that meant \u201cdanger ahead.\u201d", "22": "\u201cThen you would be very unwise,\u201d rejoined Anne hastily. \u201cI\u2019m sure no life can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and sorrow\u2014though I suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that we admit it. Come\u2014the others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning to us.\u201d", "23": "They all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of deep red fire and pallid gold. To their left lay Kingsport, its roofs and spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke. To their right lay the harbor, taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the sunset. Before them the water shimmered, satin smooth and silver gray, and beyond, clean shaven William\u2019s Island loomed out of the mist, guarding the town like a sturdy bulldog. Its lighthouse beacon flared through the mist like a baleful star, and was answered by another in the far horizon.", "24": "\u201cDid you ever see such a strong-looking place?\u201d asked Philippa. \u201cI don\u2019t want William\u2019s Island especially, but I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t get it if I did. Look at that sentry on the summit of the fort, right beside the flag. Doesn\u2019t he look as if he had stepped out of a romance?\u201d", "25": "\u201cSpeaking of romance,\u201d said Priscilla, \u201cwe\u2019ve been looking for heather\u2014but, of course, we couldn\u2019t find any. It\u2019s too late in the season, I suppose.\u201d", "26": "\u201cHeather!\u201d exclaimed Anne. \u201cHeather doesn\u2019t grow in America, does it?\u201d", "27": "\u201cThere are just two patches of it in the whole continent,\u201d said Phil, \u201cone right here in the park, and one somewhere else in Nova Scotia, I forget where. The famous Highland Regiment, the Black Watch, camped here one year, and, when the men shook out the straw of their beds in the spring, some seeds of heather took root.\u201d", "28": "\u201cOh, how delightful!\u201d said enchanted Anne.", "29": "\u201cLet\u2019s go home around by Spofford Avenue,\u201d suggested Gilbert. \u201cWe can see all \u2018the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell.\u2019 Spofford Avenue is the finest residential street in Kingsport. Nobody can build on it unless he\u2019s a millionaire.\u201d", "30": "\u201cOh, do,\u201d said Phil. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfectly killing little place I want to show you, Anne. IT wasn\u2019t built by a millionaire. It\u2019s the first place after you leave the park, and must have grown while Spofford Avenue was still a country road. It DID grow\u2014it wasn\u2019t built! I don\u2019t care for the houses on the Avenue. They\u2019re too brand new and plateglassy. But this little spot is a dream\u2014and its name\u2014but wait till you see it.\u201d", "31": "They saw it as they walked up the pine-fringed hill from the park. Just on the crest, where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road, was a little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it, stretching their arms protectingly over its low roof. It was covered with red and gold vines, through which its green-shuttered windows peeped. Before it was a tiny garden, surrounded by a low stone wall. October though it was, the garden was still very sweet with dear, old-fashioned, unworldly flowers and shrubs\u2014sweet may, southern-wood, lemon verbena, alyssum, petunias, marigolds and chrysanthemums. A tiny brick wall, in herring-bone pattern, led from the gate to the front porch. The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village; yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor, the big lawn-encircled palace of a tobacco king, look exceedingly crude and showy and ill-bred by contrast. As Phil said, it was the difference between being born and being made.", "32": "\u201cIt\u2019s the dearest place I ever saw,\u201d said Anne delightedly. \u201cIt gives me one of my old, delightful funny aches. It\u2019s dearer and quainter than even Miss Lavendar\u2019s stone house.\u201d", "33": "\u201cIt\u2019s the name I want you to notice especially,\u201d said Phil. \u201cLook\u2014in white letters, around the archway over the gate. \u2018Patty\u2019s Place.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that killing? Especially on this Avenue of Pinehursts and Elmwolds and Cedarcrofts? \u2018Patty\u2019s Place,\u2019 if you please! I adore it.\u201d", "34": "\u201cHave you any idea who Patty is?\u201d asked Priscilla.", "35": "\u201cPatty Spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it, I\u2019ve discovered. She lives there with her niece, and they\u2019ve lived there for hundreds of years, more or less\u2014maybe a little less, Anne. Exaggeration is merely a flight of poetic fancy. I understand that wealthy folk have tried to buy the lot time and again\u2014it\u2019s really worth a small fortune now, you know\u2014but \u2018Patty\u2019 won\u2019t sell upon any consideration. And there\u2019s an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back yard\u2014you\u2019ll see it when we get a little past\u2014a real apple orchard on Spofford Avenue!\u201d", "36": "\u201cI\u2019m going to dream about \u2018Patty\u2019s Place\u2019 tonight,\u201d said Anne. \u201cWhy, I feel as if I belonged to it. I wonder if, by any chance, we\u2019ll ever see the inside of it.\u201d", "37": "\u201cIt isn\u2019t likely,\u201d said Priscilla.", "38": "Anne smiled mysteriously.", "39": "\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t likely.

I have a queer, creepy, crawly feeling\u2014you can call it a presentiment, if you like\u2014that \u2018Patty\u2019s Place\u2019 and I are going to be better acquainted yet.\u201d"}, "Chapter VII": {"0": "Those first three weeks at Redmond had seemed long; but the rest of the term flew by on wings of wind. Before they realized it the Redmond students found themselves in the grind of Christmas examinations, emerging therefrom more or less triumphantly.

I shall never forgive you, Queen Anne, for not coming home with me for the holidays.\u201d", "3": "\u201c\u2018Never\u2019 means three days with you, Phil.

You\u2019ll die of lonesomeness, child.\u201d", "5": "\u201cIn Avonlea?\u201d said Anne, highly amused.", "6": "\u201cNow, if you\u2019d come with me you\u2019d have a perfectly gorgeous time.

I\u2019m going home to an old country farmhouse, once green, rather faded now, set among leafless apple orchards. There is a brook below and a December fir wood beyond, where I\u2019ve heard harps swept by the fingers of rain and wind. There is a pond nearby that will be gray and brooding now. There will be two oldish ladies in the house, one tall and thin, one short and fat; and there will be two twins, one a perfect model, the other what Mrs. Lynde calls a \u2018holy terror.\u2019 There will be a little room upstairs over the porch, where old dreams hang thick, and a big, fat, glorious feather bed which will almost seem the height of luxury after a boardinghouse mattress.

Green Gables had a very festal appearance as they drove up the lane. There was a light in every window, the glow breaking out through the darkness like flame-red blossoms swung against the dark background of the Haunted Wood. And in the yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around it, one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under the poplars.", "13": "\u201cDavy means that for an Indian war-whoop,\u201d said Diana. \u201cMr. Harrison\u2019s hired boy taught it to him, and he\u2019s been practicing it up to welcome you with. Mrs. Lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle. He creeps up behind her, you know, and then lets go. He was determined to have a bonfire for you, too. He\u2019s been piling up branches for a fortnight and pestering Marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over it before setting it on fire. I guess she did, by the smell, though Mrs. Lynde said up to the last that Davy would blow himself and everybody else up if he was let.\u201d", "14": "Anne was out of the buggy by this time, and Davy was rapturously hugging her knees, while even Dora was clinging to her hand.", "15": "\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bully bonfire, Anne?

She preferred to meet Anne in the shadows, for she was horribly afraid that she was going to cry with joy\u2014she, stern, repressed Marilla, who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly. Mrs. Lynde was behind her, sonsy, kindly, matronly, as of yore. The love that Anne had told Phil was waiting for her surrounded her and enfolded her with its blessing and its sweetness. Nothing, after all, could compare with old ties, old friends, and old Green Gables! How starry Anne\u2019s eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table, how pink her cheeks, how silver-clear her laughter! And Diana was going to stay all night, too. How like the dear old times it was! And the rose-bud tea-set graced the table! With Marilla the force of nature could no further go.", "17": "\u201cI suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night,\u201d said Marilla sarcastically, as the girls went upstairs.

They both looked as fresh and bright-eyed at breakfast as only youth can look after unlawful hours of revelry and confession. There had been no snow up to this time, but as Diana crossed the old log bridge on her homeward way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the fields and woods, russet and gray in their dreamless sleep. Soon the far-away slopes and hills were dim and wraith-like through their gauzy scarfing, as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair and was waiting for her wintry bridegroom. So they had a white Christmas after all, and a very pleasant day it was. In the forenoon letters and gifts came from Miss Lavendar and Paul; Anne opened them in the cheerful Green Gables kitchen, which was filled with what Davy, sniffing in ecstasy, called \u201cpretty smells.\u201d", "48": "\u201cMiss Lavendar and Mr. Irving are settled in their new home now,\u201d reported Anne. \u201cI am sure Miss Lavendar is perfectly happy\u2014I know it by the general tone of her letter\u2014but there\u2019s a note from Charlotta the Fourth. She doesn\u2019t like Boston at all, and she is fearfully homesick. Miss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while I\u2019m home and light a fire to air it, and see that the cushions aren\u2019t getting moldy.

So that\u2019s no guide, though it should be, according to all the novels I\u2019ve ever read. Now, Anne, YOUR heart wouldn\u2019t thump for anybody but the genuine Prince Charming, would it? There must be something radically wrong with mine. But I\u2019m having a perfectly gorgeous time. How I wish you were here! It\u2019s snowing today, and I\u2019m rapturous. I was so afraid we\u2019d have a green Christmas and I loathe them.

How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there. But they weren\u2019t because I wanted them. If I HADN\u2019T wanted them they would have been there by the dozen. And I couldn\u2019t decide what to say to the conductor when he came around. As soon as I got one sentence of explanation mapped out in my mind I felt nobody could believe it and I must compose another. It seemed there was nothing to do but trust in Providence, and for all the comfort that gave me I might as well have been the old lady who, when told by the captain during a storm that she must put her trust in the Almighty exclaimed, \u2018Oh, Captain, is it as bad as that?\u2019", "57": "\u201cJust at the conventional moment, when all hope had fled, and the conductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me, I suddenly remembered where I had put that wretched coin of the realm.

The perfume of Miss Lavendar\u2019s rose bowl still filled the air. It was hardly possible to believe that Miss Lavendar would not come tripping in presently, with her brown eyes a-star with welcome, and that Charlotta the Fourth, blue of bow and wide of smile, would not pop through the door.

He\u2019s always been crazy about you\u2014and now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and there\u2019s nothing to prevent him from getting married. But he\u2019s so shy he couldn\u2019t ask you himself if you\u2019d have him, so he got me to do it. I\u2019d rather not have, but he gave me no peace till I said I would, if I got a good chance. What do you think about it, Anne?\u201d", "13": "Was it a dream? Was it one of those nightmare things in which you find yourself engaged or married to some one you hate or don\u2019t know, without the slightest idea how it ever came about? No, she, Anne Shirley, was lying there, wide awake, in her own bed, and Jane Andrews was beside her, calmly proposing for her brother Billy. Anne did not know whether she wanted to writhe or laugh; but she could do neither, for Jane\u2019s feelings must not be hurt.", "14": "\u201cI\u2014I couldn\u2019t marry Bill, you know, Jane,\u201d she managed to gasp. \u201cWhy, such an idea never occurred to me\u2014never!\u201d", "15": "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it did,\u201d agreed Jane. \u201cBilly has always been far too shy to think of courting. But you might think it over, Anne. Billy is a good fellow. I must say that, if he is my brother. He has no bad habits and he\u2019s a great worker, and you can depend on him. \u2018A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\u2019 He told me to tell you he\u2019d be quite willing to wait till you got through college, if you insisted, though he\u2019d RATHER get married this spring before the planting begins. He\u2019d always be very good to you, I\u2019m sure, and you know, Anne, I\u2019d love to have you for a sister.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI can\u2019t marry Billy,\u201d said Anne decidedly. She had recovered her wits, and was even feeling a little angry. It was all so ridiculous. \u201cThere is no use thinking of it, Jane. I don\u2019t care anything for him in that way, and you must tell him so.\u201d", "17": "\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t suppose you would,\u201d said Jane with a resigned sigh, feeling that she had done her best. \u201cI told Billy I didn\u2019t believe it was a bit of use to ask you, but he insisted. Well, you\u2019ve made your decision, Anne, and I hope you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d", "18": "Jane spoke rather coldly. She had been perfectly sure that the enamored Billy had no chance at all of inducing Anne to marry him. Nevertheless, she felt a little resentment that Anne Shirley, who was, after all, merely an adopted orphan, without kith or kin, should refuse her brother\u2014one of the Avonlea Andrews. Well, pride sometimes goes before a fall, Jane reflected ominously.", "19": "Anne permitted herself to smile in the darkness over the idea that she might ever regret not marrying Billy Andrews.", "20": "\u201cI hope Billy won\u2019t feel very badly over it,\u201d she said nicely.", "21": "Jane made a movement as if she were tossing her head on her pillow.", "22": "\u201cOh, he won\u2019t break his heart. Billy has too much good sense for that. He likes Nettie Blewett pretty well, too, and mother would rather he married her than any one. She\u2019s such a good manager and saver. I think, when Billy is once sure you won\u2019t have him, he\u2019ll take Nettie. Please don\u2019t mention this to any one, will you, Anne?\u201d", "23": "\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Anne, who had no desire whatever to publish abroad the fact that Billy Andrews wanted to marry her, preferring her, when all was said and done, to Nettie Blewett. Nettie Blewett!", "24": "\u201cAnd now I suppose we\u2019d better go to sleep,\u201d suggested Jane.", "25": "To sleep went Jane easily and speedily; but, though very unlike MacBeth in most respects, she had certainly contrived to murder sleep for Anne. That proposed-to damsel lay on a wakeful pillow until the wee sma\u2019s, but her meditations were far from being romantic. It was not, however, until the next morning that she had an opportunity to indulge in a good laugh over the whole affair. When Jane had gone home\u2014still with a hint of frost in voice and manner because Anne had declined so ungratefully and decidedly the honor of an alliance with the House of Andrews\u2014Anne retreated to the porch room, shut the door, and had her laugh out at last.", "26": "\u201cIf I could only share the joke with some one!\u201d she thought. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. Diana is the only one I\u2019d want to tell, and, even if I hadn\u2019t sworn secrecy to Jane, I can\u2019t tell Diana things now. She tells everything to Fred\u2014I know she does. Well, I\u2019ve had my first proposal. I supposed it would come some day\u2014but I certainly never thought it would be by proxy. It\u2019s awfully funny\u2014and yet there\u2019s a sting in it, too, somehow.\u201d", "27": "Anne knew quite well wherein the sting consisted, though she did not put it into words. She had had her secret dreams of the first time some one should ask her the great question. And it had, in those dreams, always been very romantic and beautiful: and the \u201csome one\u201d was to be very handsome and dark-eyed and distinguished-looking and eloquent, whether he were Prince Charming to be enraptured with \u201cyes,\u201d or one to whom a regretful, beautifully worded, but hopeless refusal must be given. If the latter, the refusal was to be expressed so delicately that it would be next best thing to acceptance, and he would go away, after kissing her hand, assuring her of his unalterable, life-long devotion. And it would always be a beautiful memory, to be proud of and a little sad about, also.", "28": "And now, this thrilling experience had turned out to be merely grotesque. Billy Andrews had got his sister to propose for him because his father had given him the upper farm; and if Anne wouldn\u2019t \u201chave him\u201d Nettie Blewett would. There was romance for you, with a vengeance! Anne laughed\u2014and then sighed. The bloom had been brushed from one little maiden dream. Would the painful process go on until everything became prosaic and hum-drum?"}, "Chapter IX": {"0": "An Unwelcome Lover and a Welcome Friend", "1": "The second term at Redmond sped as quickly as had the first\u2014\u201cactually whizzed away,\u201d Philippa said. Anne enjoyed it thoroughly in all its phases\u2014the stimulating class rivalry, the making and deepening of new and helpful friendships, the gay little social stunts, the doings of the various societies of which she was a member, the widening of horizons and interests. She studied hard, for she had made up her mind to win the Thorburn Scholarship in English. This being won, meant that she could come back to Redmond the next year without trenching on Marilla\u2019s small savings\u2014something Anne was determined she would not do.", "2": "Gilbert, too, was in full chase after a scholarship, but found plenty of time for frequent calls at Thirty-eight, St. John\u2019s. He was Anne\u2019s escort at nearly all the college affairs, and she knew that their names were coupled in Redmond gossip. Anne raged over this but was helpless; she could not cast an old friend like Gilbert aside, especially when he had grown suddenly wise and wary, as behooved him in the dangerous proximity of more than one Redmond youth who would gladly have taken his place by the side of the slender, red-haired coed, whose gray eyes were as alluring as stars of evening. Anne was never attended by the crowd of willing victims who hovered around Philippa\u2019s conquering march through her Freshman year; but there was a lanky, brainy Freshie, a jolly, little, round Sophomore, and a tall, learned Junior who all liked to call at Thirty-eight, St. John\u2019s, and talk over \u2018ologies and \u2018isms, as well as lighter subjects, with Anne, in the becushioned parlor of that domicile. Gilbert did not love any of them, and he was exceedingly careful to give none of them the advantage over him by any untimely display of his real feelings Anne-ward. To her he had become again the boy-comrade of Avonlea days, and as such could hold his own against any smitten swain who had so far entered the lists against him. As a companion, Anne honestly acknowledged nobody could be so satisfactory as Gilbert; she was very glad, so she told herself, that he had evidently dropped all nonsensical ideas\u2014though she spent considerable time secretly wondering why.", "3": "Only one disagreeable incident marred that winter. Charlie Sloane, sitting bolt upright on Miss Ada\u2019s most dearly beloved cushion, asked Anne one night if she would promise \u201cto become Mrs. Charlie Sloane some day.\u201d Coming after Billy Andrews\u2019 proxy effort, this was not quite the shock to Anne\u2019s romantic sensibilities that it would otherwise have been; but it was certainly another heart-rending disillusion. She was angry, too, for she felt that she had never given Charlie the slightest encouragement to suppose such a thing possible. But what could you expect of a Sloane, as Mrs. Rachel Lynde would ask scornfully? Charlie\u2019s whole attitude, tone, air, words, fairly reeked with Sloanishness. \u201cHe was conferring a great honor\u2014no doubt whatever about that. And when Anne, utterly insensible to the honor, refused him, as delicately and considerately as she could\u2014for even a Sloane had feelings which ought not to be unduly lacerated\u2014Sloanishness still further betrayed itself. Charlie certainly did not take his dismissal as Anne\u2019s imaginary rejected suitors did. Instead, he became angry, and showed it; he said two or three quite nasty things; Anne\u2019s temper flashed up mutinously and she retorted with a cutting little speech whose keenness pierced even Charlie\u2019s protective Sloanishness and reached the quick; he caught up his hat and flung himself out of the house with a very red face; Anne rushed upstairs, falling twice over Miss Ada\u2019s cushions on the way, and threw herself on her bed, in tears of humiliation and rage. Had she actually stooped to quarrel with a Sloane? Was it possible anything Charlie Sloane could say had power to make her angry? Oh, this was degradation, indeed\u2014worse even than being the rival of Nettie Blewett!", "4": "\u201cI wish I need never see the horrible creature again,\u201d she sobbed vindictively into her pillows.", "5": "She could not avoid seeing him again, but the outraged Charlie took care that it should not be at very close quarters. Miss Ada\u2019s cushions were henceforth safe from his depredations, and when he met Anne on the street, or in Redmond\u2019s halls, his bow was icy in the extreme. Relations between these two old schoolmates continued to be thus strained for nearly a year! Then Charlie transferred his blighted affections to a round, rosy, snub-nosed, blue-eyed, little Sophomore who appreciated them as they deserved, whereupon he forgave Anne and condescended to be civil to her again; in a patronizing manner intended to show her just what she had lost.", "6": "One day Anne scurried excitedly into Priscilla\u2019s room.", "7": "\u201cRead that,\u201d she cried, tossing Priscilla a letter. \u201cIt\u2019s from Stella\u2014and she\u2019s coming to Redmond next year\u2014and what do you think of her idea? I think it\u2019s a perfectly splendid one, if we can only carry it out. Do you suppose we can, Pris?\u201d", "8": "\u201cI\u2019ll be better able to tell you when I find out what it is,\u201d said Priscilla, casting aside a Greek lexicon and taking up Stella\u2019s letter.

As I took the third year at Queen\u2019s I can enter the Sophomore year. I\u2019m tired of teaching in a back country school. Some day I\u2019m going to write a treatise on \u2018The Trials of a Country Schoolmarm.\u2019 It will be a harrowing bit of realism. It seems to be the prevailing impression that we live in clover, and have nothing to do but draw our quarter\u2019s salary. My treatise shall tell the truth about us. Why, if a week should pass without some one telling me that I am doing easy work for big pay I would conclude that I might as well order my ascension robe \u2018immediately and to onct.\u2019 \u2018Well, you get your money easy,\u2019 some rate-payer will tell me, condescendingly. \u2018All you have to do is to sit there and hear lessons.\u2019 I used to argue the matter at first, but I\u2019m wiser now. Facts are stubborn things, but as some one has wisely said, not half so stubborn as fallacies. So I only smile loftily now in eloquent silence. Why, I have nine grades in my school and I have to teach a little of everything, from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system. My youngest pupil is four\u2014his mother sends him to school to \u2018get him out of the way\u2019\u2014and my oldest twenty\u2014it \u2018suddenly struck him\u2019 that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer. In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day I don\u2019t wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph. \u2018I have to look for what\u2019s coming next before I know what went last,\u2019 he complained. I feel like that myself.", "10": "\u201cAnd the letters I get, Anne! Tommy\u2019s mother writes me that Tommy is not coming on in arithmetic as fast as she would like. He is only in simple reduction yet, and Johnny Johnson is in fractions, and Johnny isn\u2019t half as smart as her Tommy, and she can\u2019t understand it. And Susy\u2019s father wants to know why Susy can\u2019t write a letter without misspelling half the words, and Dick\u2019s aunt wants me to change his seat, because that bad Brown boy he is sitting with is teaching him to say naughty words.", "11": "\u201cAs to the financial part\u2014but I\u2019ll not begin on that. Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make country schoolmarms!", "12": "\u201cThere, I feel better, after that growl. After all, I\u2019ve enjoyed these past two years. But I\u2019m coming to Redmond.", "13": "\u201cAnd now, Anne, I\u2019ve a little plan. You know how I loathe boarding. I\u2019ve boarded for four years and I\u2019m so tired of it. I don\u2019t feel like enduring three years more of it.", "14": "\u201cNow, why can\u2019t you and Priscilla and I club together, rent a little house somewhere in Kingsport, and board ourselves? It would be cheaper than any other way. Of course, we would have to have a housekeeper and I have one ready on the spot. You\u2019ve heard me speak of Aunt Jamesina? She\u2019s the sweetest aunt that ever lived, in spite of her name. She can\u2019t help that! She was called Jamesina because her father, whose name was James, was drowned at sea a month before she was born. I always call her Aunt Jimsie. Well, her only daughter has recently married and gone to the foreign mission field. Aunt Jamesina is left alone in a great big house, and she is horribly lonesome. She will come to Kingsport and keep house for us if we want her, and I know you\u2019ll both love her. The more I think of the plan the more I like it. We could have such good, independent times.", "15": "\u201cNow, if you and Priscilla agree to it, wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea for you, who are on the spot, to look around and see if you can find a suitable house this spring? That would be better than leaving it till the fall. If you could get a furnished one so much the better, but if not, we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family friends with attics. Anyhow, decide as soon as you can and write me, so that Aunt Jamesina will know what plans to make for next year.\u201d", "16": "\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Priscilla.", "17": "\u201cSo do I,\u201d agreed Anne delightedly. \u201cOf course, we have a nice boardinghouse here, but, when all\u2019s said and done, a boardinghouse isn\u2019t home. So let\u2019s go house-hunting at once, before exams come on.\u201d", "18": "\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house,\u201d warned Priscilla. \u201cDon\u2019t expect too much, Anne. Nice houses in nice localities will probably be away beyond our means. We\u2019ll likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown, and make life inside compensate for the outside.\u201d", "19": "Accordingly they went house-hunting, but to find just what they wanted proved even harder than Priscilla had feared. Houses there were galore, furnished and unfurnished; but one was too big, another too small; this one too expensive, that one too far from Redmond. Exams were on and over; the last week of the term came and still their \u201chouse o\u2019dreams,\u201d as Anne called it, remained a castle in the air.", "20": "\u201cWe shall have to give up and wait till the fall, I suppose,\u201d said Priscilla wearily, as they rambled through the park on one of April\u2019s darling days of breeze and blue, when the harbor was creaming and shimmering beneath the pearl-hued mists floating over it. \u201cWe may find some shack to shelter us then; and if not, boardinghouses we shall have always with us.\u201d", "21": "\u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about it just now, anyway, and spoil this lovely afternoon,\u201d said Anne, gazing around her with delight. The fresh chill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam, and the sky above was crystal clear and blue\u2014a great inverted cup of blessing. \u201cSpring is singing in my blood today, and the lure of April is abroad on the air. I\u2019m seeing visions and dreaming dreams, Pris. That\u2019s because the wind is from the west. I do love the west wind. It sings of hope and gladness, doesn\u2019t it? When the east wind blows I always think of sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore. When I get old I shall have rheumatism when the wind is east.\u201d", "22": "\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it jolly when you discard furs and winter garments for the first time and sally forth, like this, in spring attire?\u201d laughed Priscilla. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel as if you had been made over new?\u201d", "23": "\u201cEverything is new in the spring,\u201d said Anne. \u201cSprings themselves are always so new, too. No spring is ever just like any other spring. It always has something of its own to be its own peculiar sweetness.

This day next week we\u2019ll be home.\u201d", "25": "\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d said Anne dreamily. \u201cThere are so many things I want to do. I want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down over Mr. Harrison\u2019s fields. I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood and gather violets in Violet Vale. Do you remember the day of our golden picnic, Priscilla? I want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering. But I\u2019ve learned to love Kingsport, too, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m coming back next fall. If I hadn\u2019t won the Thorburn I don\u2019t believe I could have.

The April wind was filling the pine trees with its roundelay, and the grove was alive with robins\u2014great, plump, saucy fellows, strutting along the paths. The girls rang rather timidly, and were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden. The door opened directly into a large living-room, where by a cheery little fire sat two other ladies, both of whom were also grim and ancient. Except that one looked to be about seventy and the other fifty, there seemed little difference between them. Each had amazingly big, light-blue eyes behind steel-rimmed spectacles; each wore a cap and a gray shawl; each was knitting without haste and without rest; each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking; and just behind each sat a large white china dog, with round green spots all over it, a green nose and green ears. Those dogs captured Anne\u2019s fancy on the spot; they seemed like the twin guardian deities of Patty\u2019s Place.", "1": "For a few minutes nobody spoke. The girls were too nervous to find words, and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed conversationally inclined. Anne glanced about the room. What a dear place it was! Another door opened out of it directly into the pine grove and the robins came boldly up on the very step. The floor was spotted with round, braided mats, such as Marilla made at Green Gables, but which were considered out of date everywhere else, even in Avonlea. And yet here they were on Spofford Avenue! A big, polished grandfather\u2019s clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner. There were delightful little cupboards over the mantelpiece, behind whose glass doors gleamed quaint bits of china. The walls were hung with old prints and silhouettes. In one corner the stairs went up, and at the first low turn was a long window with an inviting seat. It was all just as Anne had known it must be.", "2": "By this time the silence had grown too dreadful, and Priscilla nudged Anne to intimate that she must speak.", "3": "\u201cWe\u2014we\u2014saw by your sign that this house is to let,\u201d said Anne faintly, addressing the older lady, who was evidently Miss Patty Spofford.", "4": "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Miss Patty. \u201cI intended to take that sign down today.\u201d", "5": "\u201cThen\u2014then we are too late,\u201d said Anne sorrowfully. \u201cYou\u2019ve let it to some one else?\u201d", "6": "\u201cNo, but we have decided not to let it at all.\u201d", "7": "\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d exclaimed Anne impulsively. \u201cI love this place so. I did hope we could have got it.\u201d", "8": "Then did Miss Patty lay down her knitting, take off her specs, rub them, put them on again, and for the first time look at Anne as at a human being.

Or that you merely like the looks of it? The girls nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell what they DO mean. It wasn\u2019t so in my young days.

Now, you know a young person like Maria can\u2019t go globetrotting alone.\u201d", "19": "\u201cNo\u2014I\u2014I suppose not,\u201d murmured Anne, seeing that Miss Patty was quite solemnly in earnest.", "20": "\u201cOf course not. So I have to go along to look after her. I expect to enjoy it, too; I\u2019m seventy years old, but I\u2019m not tired of living yet. I daresay I\u2019d have gone to Europe before if the idea had occurred to me. We shall be away for two years, perhaps three. We sail in June and we shall send you the key, and leave all in order for you to take possession when you choose. We shall pack away a few things we prize especially, but all the rest will be left.\u201d", "21": "\u201cWill you leave the china dogs?\u201d asked Anne timidly.", "22": "\u201cWould you like me to?\u201d", "23": "\u201cOh, indeed, yes. They are delightful.\u201d", "24": "A pleased expression came into Miss Patty\u2019s face.", "25": "\u201cI think a great deal of those dogs,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cThey are over a hundred years old, and they have sat on either side of this fireplace ever since my brother Aaron brought them from London fifty years ago. Spofford Avenue was called after my brother Aaron.\u201d", "26": "\u201cA fine man he was,\u201d said Miss Maria, speaking for the first time. \u201cAh, you don\u2019t see the like of him nowadays.\u201d", "27": "\u201cHe was a good uncle to you, Maria,\u201d said Miss Patty, with evident emotion. \u201cYou do well to remember him.\u201d", "28": "\u201cI shall always remember him,\u201d said Miss Maria solemnly. \u201cI can see him, this minute, standing there before that fire, with his hands under his coat-tails, beaming on us.\u201d", "29": "Miss Maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but Miss Patty came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business.", "30": "\u201cI shall leave the dogs where they are, if you will promise to be very careful of them,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir names are Gog and Magog. Gog looks to the right and Magog to the left. And there\u2019s just one thing more. You don\u2019t object, I hope, to this house being called Patty\u2019s Place?\u201d", "31": "\u201cNo, indeed. We think that is one of the nicest things about it.\u201d", "32": "\u201cYou have sense, I see,\u201d said Miss Patty in a tone of great satisfaction. \u201cWould you believe it? All the people who came here to rent the house wanted to know if they couldn\u2019t take the name off the gate during their occupation of it. I told them roundly that the name went with the house. This has been Patty\u2019s Place ever since my brother Aaron left it to me in his will, and Patty\u2019s Place it shall remain until I die and Maria dies. After that happens the next possessor can call it any fool name he likes,\u201d concluded Miss Patty, much as she might have said, \u201cAfter that\u2014the deluge.\u201d \u201cAnd now, wouldn\u2019t you like to go over the house and see it all before we consider the bargain made?\u201d", "33": "Further exploration still further delighted the girls. Besides the big living-room, there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs. Upstairs were three rooms, one large and two small. Anne took an especial fancy to one of the small ones, looking out into the big pines, and hoped it would be hers. It was papered in pale blue and had a little, old-timey toilet table with sconces for candles. There was a diamond-paned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that would be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming.", "34": "\u201cIt\u2019s all so delicious that I know we are going to wake up and find it a fleeting vision of the night,\u201d said Priscilla as they went away.", "35": "\u201cMiss Patty and Miss Maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made of,\u201d laughed Anne. \u201cCan you fancy them \u2018globe-trotting\u2019\u2014especially in those shawls and caps?\u201d", "36": "\u201cI suppose they\u2019ll take them off when they really begin to trot,\u201d said Priscilla, \u201cbut I know they\u2019ll take their knitting with them everywhere. They simply couldn\u2019t be parted from it. They will walk about Westminster Abbey and knit, I feel sure. Meanwhile, Anne, we shall be living in Patty\u2019s Place\u2014and on Spofford Avenue.

Anyway, I\u2019ve been packing up.\u201d", "40": "\u201cAnd I suppose you are worn out because you couldn\u2019t decide which things to pack first, or where to put them,\u201d laughed Priscilla.", "41": "\u201cE-zackly. And when I had got everything jammed in somehow, and my landlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it, I discovered I had packed a whole lot of things I wanted for Convocation at the very bottom. I had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive into it for an hour before I fished out what I wanted. I would get hold of something that felt like what I was looking for, and I\u2019d yank it up, and it would be something else. No, Anne, I did NOT swear.\u201d", "42": "\u201cI didn\u2019t say you did.\u201d", "43": "\u201cWell, you looked it. But I admit my thoughts verged on the profane.

Queen Anne, do say something to cheer me up.\u201d", "44": "\u201cRemember that next Thursday night, you\u2019ll be back in the land of Alec and Alonzo,\u201d suggested Anne.", "45": "Phil shook her head dolefully.", "46": "\u201cMore alliteration. No, I don\u2019t want Alec and Alonzo when I have a cold in the head. But what has happened you two? Now that I look at you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence.

I never wanted anything so much in my life\u2014and this floor is awfully hard.\u201d", "56": "\u201cThere\u2019s just one more thing,\u201d said Priscilla resolutely. \u201cYou, Phil, as all Redmond knows, entertain callers almost every evening. Now, at Patty\u2019s Place we can\u2019t do that. We have decided that we shall be at home to our friends on Friday evenings only.

I knew I should have had some such rule myself, but I hadn\u2019t enough decision to make it or stick to it. When I can shuffle off the responsibility on you it will be a real relief. If you won\u2019t let me cast in my lot with you I\u2019ll die of the disappointment and then I\u2019ll come back and haunt you.

People told her she hadn\u2019t changed much, in a tone which hinted they were surprised and a little disappointed she hadn\u2019t. Avonlea had not changed, either. At least, so it seemed at first. But as Anne sat in the Green Gables pew, on the first Sunday after her return, and looked over the congregation, she saw several little changes which, all coming home to her at once, made her realize that time did not quite stand still, even in Avonlea. A new minister was in the pulpit. In the pews more than one familiar face was missing forever. Old \u201cUncle Abe,\u201d his prophesying over and done with, Mrs. Peter Sloane, who had sighed, it was to be hoped, for the last time, Timothy Cotton, who, as Mrs. Rachel Lynde said \u201chad actually managed to die at last after practicing at it for twenty years,\u201d and old Josiah Sloane, whom nobody knew in his coffin because he had his whiskers neatly trimmed, were all sleeping in the little graveyard behind the church. And Billy Andrews was married to Nettie Blewett! They \u201cappeared out\u201d that Sunday. When Billy, beaming with pride and happiness, showed his be-plumed and be-silked bride into the Harmon Andrews\u2019 pew, Anne dropped her lids to hide her dancing eyes. She recalled the stormy winter night of the Christmas holidays when Jane had proposed for Billy. He certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection. Anne wondered if Jane had also proposed to Nettie for him, or if he had mustered enough spunk to ask the fateful question himself. All the Andrews family seemed to share in his pride and pleasure, from Mrs. Harmon in the pew to Jane in the choir. Jane had resigned from the Avonlea school and intended to go West in the fall.", "1": "\u201cCan\u2019t get a beau in Avonlea, that\u2019s what,\u201d said Mrs. Rachel Lynde scornfully. \u201cSAYS she thinks she\u2019ll have better health out West. I never heard her health was poor before.\u201d", "2": "\u201cJane is a nice girl,\u201d Anne had said loyally. \u201cShe never tried to attract attention, as some did.\u201d", "3": "\u201cOh, she never chased the boys, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d said Mrs. Rachel. \u201cBut she\u2019d like to be married, just as much as anybody, that\u2019s what. What else would take her out West to some forsaken place whose only recommendation is that men are plenty and women scarce? Don\u2019t you tell me!\u201d", "4": "But it was not at Jane, Anne gazed that day in dismay and surprise. It was at Ruby Gillis, who sat beside her in the choir. What had happened to Ruby? She was even handsomer than ever; but her blue eyes were too bright and lustrous, and the color of her cheeks was hectically brilliant; besides, she was very thin; the hands that held her hymn-book were almost transparent in their delicacy.", "5": "\u201cIs Ruby Gillis ill?\u201d Anne asked of Mrs. Lynde, as they went home from church.", "6": "\u201cRuby Gillis is dying of galloping consumption,\u201d said Mrs. Lynde bluntly. \u201cEverybody knows it except herself and her FAMILY. They won\u2019t give in. If you ask THEM, she\u2019s perfectly well. She hasn\u2019t been able to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter, but she says she\u2019s going to teach again in the fall, and she\u2019s after the White Sands school. She\u2019ll be in her grave, poor girl, when White Sands school opens, that\u2019s what.\u201d", "7": "Anne listened in shocked silence. Ruby Gillis, her old school-chum, dying? Could it be possible? Of late years they had grown apart; but the old tie of school-girl intimacy was there, and made itself felt sharply in the tug the news gave at Anne\u2019s heartstrings. Ruby, the brilliant, the merry, the coquettish! It was impossible to associate the thought of her with anything like death. She had greeted Anne with gay cordiality after church, and urged her to come up the next evening.", "8": "\u201cI\u2019ll be away Tuesday and Wednesday evenings,\u201d she had whispered triumphantly. \u201cThere\u2019s a concert at Carmody and a party at White Sands. Herb Spencer\u2019s going to take me. He\u2019s my LATEST. Be sure to come up tomorrow. I\u2019m dying for a good talk with you. I want to hear all about your doings at Redmond.\u201d", "9": "Anne knew that Ruby meant that she wanted to tell Anne all about her own recent flirtations, but she promised to go, and Diana offered to go with her.", "10": "\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to go to see Ruby for a long while,\u201d she told Anne, when they left Green Gables the next evening, \u201cbut I really couldn\u2019t go alone. It\u2019s so awful to hear Ruby rattling on as she does, and pretending there is nothing the matter with her, even when she can hardly speak for coughing. She\u2019s fighting so hard for her life, and yet she hasn\u2019t any chance at all, they say.\u201d", "11": "The girls walked silently down the red, twilit road. The robins were singing vespers in the high treetops, filling the golden air with their jubilant voices. The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds, over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them. The air was fragrant with the wild, sweet, wholesome smell of young raspberry copses. White mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands.", "12": "\u201cWhat a beautiful sunset,\u201d said Diana. \u201cLook, Anne, it\u2019s just like a land in itself, isn\u2019t it? That long, low back of purple cloud is the shore, and the clear sky further on is like a golden sea.\u201d", "13": "\u201cIf we could sail to it in the moonshine boat Paul wrote of in his old composition\u2014you remember?\u2014how nice it would be,\u201d said Anne, rousing from her reverie. \u201cDo you think we could find all our yesterdays there, Diana\u2014all our old springs and blossoms? The beds of flowers that Paul saw there are the roses that have bloomed for us in the past?\u201d", "14": "\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Diana. \u201cYou make me feel as if we were old women with everything in life behind us.\u201d", "15": "\u201cI think I\u2019ve almost felt as if we were since I heard about poor Ruby,\u201d said Anne. \u201cIf it is true that she is dying any other sad thing might be true, too.\u201d", "16": "\u201cYou don\u2019t mind calling in at Elisha Wright\u2019s for a moment, do you?\u201d asked Diana. \u201cMother asked me to leave this little dish of jelly for Aunt Atossa.\u201d", "17": "\u201cWho is Aunt Atossa?\u201d", "18": "\u201cOh, haven\u2019t you heard? She\u2019s Mrs. Samson Coates of Spencervale\u2014Mrs. Elisha Wright\u2019s aunt. She\u2019s father\u2019s aunt, too. Her husband died last winter and she was left very poor and lonely, so the Wrights took her to live with them. Mother thought we ought to take her, but father put his foot down. Live with Aunt Atossa he would not.\u201d", "19": "\u201cIs she so terrible?\u201d asked Anne absently.", "20": "\u201cYou\u2019ll probably see what she\u2019s like before we can get away,\u201d said Diana significantly. \u201cFather says she has a face like a hatchet\u2014it cuts the air. But her tongue is sharper still.\u201d", "21": "Late as it was Aunt Atossa was cutting potato sets in the Wright kitchen. She wore a faded old wrapper, and her gray hair was decidedly untidy.

She said you had improved a good deal.\u201d", "23": "There was no doubt Aunt Atossa thought there was plenty of room for further improvement. She ceased not from cutting sets with much energy.", "24": "\u201cIs it any use to ask you to sit down?\u201d she inquired sarcastically. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s nothing very entertaining here for you. The rest are all away.\u201d", "25": "\u201cMother sent you this little pot of rhubarb jelly,\u201d said Diana pleasantly. \u201cShe made it today and thought you might like some.\u201d", "26": "\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d said Aunt Atossa sourly. \u201cI never fancy your mother\u2019s jelly\u2014she always makes it too sweet. However, I\u2019ll try to worry some down. My appetite\u2019s been dreadful poor this spring. I\u2019m far from well,\u201d continued Aunt Atossa solemnly, \u201cbut still I keep a-doing. People who can\u2019t work aren\u2019t wanted here. If it isn\u2019t too much trouble will you be condescending enough to set the jelly in the pantry? I\u2019m in a hurry to get these spuds done tonight. I suppose you two LADIES never do anything like this. You\u2019d be afraid of spoiling your hands.\u201d", "27": "\u201cI used to cut potato sets before we rented the farm,\u201d smiled Anne.", "28": "\u201cI do it yet,\u201d laughed Diana. \u201cI cut sets three days last week. Of course,\u201d she added teasingly, \u201cI did my hands up in lemon juice and kid gloves every night after it.\u201d", "29": "Aunt Atossa sniffed.", "30": "\u201cI suppose you got that notion out of some of those silly magazines you read so many of. I wonder your mother allows you. But she always spoiled you. We all thought when George married her she wouldn\u2019t be a suitable wife for him.\u201d", "31": "Aunt Atossa sighed heavily, as if all forebodings upon the occasion of George Barry\u2019s marriage had been amply and darkly fulfilled.", "32": "\u201cGoing, are you?\u201d she inquired, as the girls rose. \u201cWell, I suppose you can\u2019t find much amusement talking to an old woman like me. It\u2019s such a pity the boys ain\u2019t home.\u201d", "33": "\u201cWe want to run in and see Ruby Gillis a little while,\u201d explained Diana.", "34": "\u201cOh, anything does for an excuse, of course,\u201d said Aunt Atossa, amiably. \u201cJust whip in and whip out before you have time to say how-do decently. It\u2019s college airs, I s\u2019pose. You\u2019d be wiser to keep away from Ruby Gillis. The doctors say consumption\u2019s catching. I always knew Ruby\u2019d get something, gadding off to Boston last fall for a visit. People who ain\u2019t content to stay home always catch something.\u201d", "35": "\u201cPeople who don\u2019t go visiting catch things, too. Sometimes they even die,\u201d said Diana solemnly.", "36": "\u201cThen they don\u2019t have themselves to blame for it,\u201d retorted Aunt Atossa triumphantly. \u201cI hear you are to be married in June, Diana.\u201d", "37": "\u201cThere is no truth in that report,\u201d said Diana, blushing.", "38": "\u201cWell, don\u2019t put it off too long,\u201d said Aunt Atossa significantly. \u201cYou\u2019ll fade soon\u2014you\u2019re all complexion and hair. And the Wrights are terrible fickle. You ought to wear a hat, MISS SHIRLEY. Your nose is freckling scandalous. My, but you ARE redheaded! Well, I s\u2019pose we\u2019re all as the Lord made us! Give Marilla Cuthbert my respects. She\u2019s never been to see me since I come to Avonlea, but I s\u2019pose I oughtn\u2019t to complain. The Cuthberts always did think themselves a cut higher than any one else round here.\u201d", "39": "\u201cOh, isn\u2019t she dreadful?\u201d gasped Diana, as they escaped down the lane.", "40": "\u201cShe\u2019s worse than Miss Eliza Andrews,\u201d said Anne. \u201cBut then think of living all your life with a name like Atossa! Wouldn\u2019t it sour almost any one? She should have tried to imagine her name was Cordelia. It might have helped her a great deal. It certainly helped me in the days when I didn\u2019t like ANNE.\u201d", "41": "\u201cJosie Pye will be just like her when she grows up,\u201d said Diana. \u201cJosie\u2019s mother and Aunt Atossa are cousins, you know. Oh, dear, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over. She\u2019s so malicious\u2014she seems to put a bad flavor in everything. Father tells such a funny story about her. One time they had a minister in Spencervale who was a very good, spiritual man but very deaf. He couldn\u2019t hear any ordinary conversation at all. Well, they used to have a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings, and all the church members present would get up and pray in turn, or say a few words on some Bible verse. But one evening Aunt Atossa bounced up. She didn\u2019t either pray or preach. Instead, she lit into everybody else in the church and gave them a fearful raking down, calling them right out by name and telling them how they all had behaved, and casting up all the quarrels and scandals of the past ten years. Finally she wound up by saying that she was disgusted with Spencervale church and she never meant to darken its door again, and she hoped a fearful judgment would come upon it.

I didn\u2019t know he was going to,\u201d cried Dora, blushing scarlet.", "27": "\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t slap him or seem a bit cross,\u201d retorted Davy. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her THAT, too, if you don\u2019t come. We\u2019ll take the short cut up this field.\u201d", "28": "\u201cI\u2019m afraid of those cows,\u201d protested poor Dora, seeing a prospect of escape.", "29": "\u201cThe very idea of your being scared of those cows,\u201d scoffed Davy. \u201cWhy, they\u2019re both younger than you.\u201d", "30": "\u201cThey\u2019re bigger,\u201d said Dora.", "31": "\u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you. Come along, now. This is great. When I grow up I ain\u2019t going to bother going to church at all. I believe I can get to heaven by myself.\u201d", "32": "\u201cYou\u2019ll go to the other place if you break the Sabbath day,\u201d said unhappy Dora, following him sorely against her will.", "33": "But Davy was not scared\u2014yet. Hell was very far off, and the delights of a fishing expedition with the Cottons were very near. He wished Dora had more spunk. She kept looking back as if she were going to cry every minute, and that spoiled a fellow\u2019s fun. Hang girls, anyway. Davy did not say \u201cdarn\u201d this time, even in thought. He was not sorry\u2014yet\u2014that he had said it once, but it might be as well not to tempt the Unknown Powers too far on one day.", "34": "The small Cottons were playing in their back yard, and hailed Davy\u2019s appearance with whoops of delight. Pete, Tommy, Adolphus, and Mirabel Cotton were all alone. Their mother and older sisters were away. Dora was thankful Mirabel was there, at least. She had been afraid she would be alone in a crowd of boys. Mirabel was almost as bad as a boy\u2014she was so noisy and sunburned and reckless. But at least she wore dresses.", "35": "\u201cWe\u2019ve come to go fishing,\u201d announced Davy.", "36": "\u201cWhoop,\u201d yelled the Cottons. They rushed away to dig worms at once, Mirabel leading the van with a tin can. Dora could have sat down and cried. Oh, if only that hateful Frank Bell had never kissed her! Then she could have defied Davy, and gone to her beloved Sunday School.", "37": "They dared not, of course, go fishing on the pond, where they would be seen by people going to church. They had to resort to the brook in the woods behind the Cotton house. But it was full of trout, and they had a glorious time that morning\u2014at least the Cottons certainly had, and Davy seemed to have it. Not being entirely bereft of prudence, he had discarded boots and stockings and borrowed Tommy Cotton\u2019s overalls. Thus accoutered, bog and marsh and undergrowth had no terrors for him. Dora was frankly and manifestly miserable. She followed the others in their peregrinations from pool to pool, clasping her Bible and quarterly tightly and thinking with bitterness of soul of her beloved class where she should be sitting that very moment, before a teacher she adored. Instead, here she was roaming the woods with those half-wild Cottons, trying to keep her boots clean and her pretty white dress free from rents and stains. Mirabel had offered the loan of an apron but Dora had scornfully refused.", "38": "The trout bit as they always do on Sundays. In an hour the transgressors had all the fish they wanted, so they returned to the house, much to Dora\u2019s relief. She sat primly on a hencoop in the yard while the others played an uproarious game of tag; and then they all climbed to the top of the pig-house roof and cut their initials on the saddleboard. The flat-roofed henhouse and a pile of straw beneath gave Davy another inspiration. They spent a splendid half hour climbing on the roof and diving off into the straw with whoops and yells.", "39": "But even unlawful pleasures must come to an end. When the rumble of wheels over the pond bridge told that people were going home from church Davy knew they must go. He discarded Tommy\u2019s overalls, resumed his own rightful attire, and turned away from his string of trout with a sigh. No use to think of taking them home.", "40": "\u201cWell, hadn\u2019t we a splendid time?\u201d he demanded defiantly, as they went down the hill field.", "41": "\u201cI hadn\u2019t,\u201d said Dora flatly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe you had\u2014really\u2014either,\u201d she added, with a flash of insight that was not to be expected of her.", "42": "\u201cI had so,\u201d cried Davy, but in the voice of one who doth protest too much. \u201cNo wonder you hadn\u2019t\u2014just sitting there like a\u2014like a mule.\u201d", "43": "\u201cI ain\u2019t going to, \u2018sociate with the Cottons,\u201d said Dora loftily.", "44": "\u201cThe Cottons are all right,\u201d retorted Davy. \u201cAnd they have far better times than we have. They do just as they please and say just what they like before everybody. I\u2019m going to do that, too, after this.\u201d", "45": "\u201cThere are lots of things you wouldn\u2019t dare say before everybody,\u201d averred Dora.", "46": "\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t.\u201d", "47": "\u201cThere is, too. Would you,\u201d demanded Dora gravely, \u201cwould you say \u2018tomcat\u2019 before the minister?\u201d", "48": "This was a staggerer. Davy was not prepared for such a concrete example of the freedom of speech. But one did not have to be consistent with Dora.", "49": "\u201cOf course not,\u201d he admitted sulkily.", "50": "\u201c\u2018Tomcat\u2019 isn\u2019t a holy word.

Now that the exhilaration of truant delights had died away, his conscience was beginning to give him salutary twinges. After all, perhaps it would have been better to have gone to Sunday School and church. Mrs. Lynde might be bossy; but there was always a box of cookies in her kitchen cupboard and she was not stingy. At this inconvenient moment Davy remembered that when he had torn his new school pants the week before, Mrs. Lynde had mended them beautifully and never said a word to Marilla about them.", "56": "But Davy\u2019s cup of iniquity was not yet full.

It had been a warm, smoky summer afternoon. The world was in a splendor of out-flowering. The idle valleys were full of hazes. The woodways were pranked with shadows and the fields with the purple of the asters.", "1": "Anne had given up a moonlight drive to the White Sands beach that she might spend the evening with Ruby. She had so spent many evenings that summer, although she often wondered what good it did any one, and sometimes went home deciding that she could not go again.", "2": "Ruby grew paler as the summer waned; the White Sands school was given up\u2014\u201cher father thought it better that she shouldn\u2019t teach till New Year\u2019s\u201d\u2014and the fancy work she loved oftener and oftener fell from hands grown too weary for it. But she was always gay, always hopeful, always chattering and whispering of her beaux, and their rivalries and despairs. It was this that made Anne\u2019s visits hard for her. What had once been silly or amusing was gruesome, now; it was death peering through a wilful mask of life. Yet Ruby seemed to cling to her, and never let her go until she had promised to come again soon.

She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and \u201cfellows.\u201d She lay in the hammock, with her untouched work beside her, and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders. Her long yellow braids of hair\u2014how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays!\u2014lay on either side of her. She had taken the pins out\u2014they made her head ache, she said.

And I\u2019d rather have you than any one else. I always liked you best of all the girls I went to school with. You were never jealous, or mean, like some of them were. Poor Em White was up to see me yesterday. You remember Em and I were such chums for three years when we went to school? And then we quarrelled the time of the school concert. We\u2019ve never spoken to each other since. Wasn\u2019t it silly? Anything like that seems silly NOW. But Em and I made up the old quarrel yesterday. She said she\u2019d have spoken years ago, only she thought I wouldn\u2019t. And I never spoke to her because I was sure she wouldn\u2019t speak to me.

Life held a different meaning, a deeper purpose. On the surface it would go on just the same; but the deeps had been stirred. It must not be with her as with poor butterfly Ruby. When she came to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the shrinking terror of something wholly different\u2014something for which accustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her. The little things of life, sweet and excellent in their place, must not be the things lived for; the highest must be sought and followed; the life of heaven must be begun here on earth.", "30": "That good night in the garden was for all time. Anne never saw Ruby in life again. The next night the A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party to Jane Andrews before her departure for the West. And, while light feet danced and bright eyes laughed and merry tongues chattered, there came a summons to a soul in Avonlea that might not be disregarded or evaded. The next morning the word went from house to house that Ruby Gillis was dead. She had died in her sleep, painlessly and calmly, and on her face was a smile\u2014as if, after all, death had come as a kindly friend to lead her over the threshold, instead of the grisly phantom she had dreaded.", "31": "Mrs. Rachel Lynde said emphatically after the funeral that Ruby Gillis was the handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on. Her loveliness, as she lay, white-clad, among the delicate flowers that Anne had placed about her, was remembered and talked of for years in Avonlea. Ruby had always been beautiful; but her beauty had been of the earth, earthy; it had had a certain insolent quality in it, as if it flaunted itself in the beholder\u2019s eye; spirit had never shone through it, intellect had never refined it. But death had touched it and consecrated it, bringing out delicate modelings and purity of outline never seen before\u2014doing what life and love and great sorrow and deep womanhood joys might have done for Ruby. Anne, looking down through a mist of tears, at her old playfellow, thought she saw the face God had meant Ruby to have, and remembered it so always.", "32": "Mrs. Gillis called Anne aside into a vacant room before the funeral procession left the house, and gave her a small packet.", "33": "\u201cI want you to have this,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cRuby would have liked you to have it.

Don\u2019t you remember what Professor Hamilton used to tell us in the literature class at Queen\u2019s? He said we were never to write a word for a low or unworthy motive, but always to cling to the very highest ideals.

The last few days of her vacation had not been pleasant. Her prize story had been published in the Island papers; and Mr. William Blair had, upon the counter of his store, a huge pile of pink, green and yellow pamphlets, containing it, one of which he gave to every customer. He sent a complimentary bundle to Anne, who promptly dropped them all in the kitchen stove. Her humiliation was the consequence of her own ideals only, for Avonlea folks thought it quite splendid that she should have won the prize. Her many friends regarded her with honest admiration; her few foes with scornful envy. Josie Pye said she believed Anne Shirley had just copied the story; she was sure she remembered reading it in a paper years before. The Sloanes, who had found out or guessed that Charlie had been \u201cturned down,\u201d said they didn\u2019t think it was much to be proud of; almost any one could have done it, if she tried. Aunt Atossa told Anne she was very sorry to hear she had taken to writing novels; nobody born and bred in Avonlea would do it; that was what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where, with goodness knew what kind of parents. Even Mrs. Rachel Lynde was darkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction, though she was almost reconciled to it by that twenty-five dollar check.", "3": "\u201cIt is perfectly amazing, the price they pay for such lies, that\u2019s what,\u201d she said, half-proudly, half-severely.", "4": "All things considered, it was a relief when going-away time came. And it was very jolly to be back at Redmond, a wise, experienced Soph with hosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day. Pris and Stella and Gilbert were there, Charlie Sloane, looking more important than ever a Sophomore looked before, Phil, with the Alec-and-Alonzo question still unsettled, and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson. Moody Spurgeon had been teaching school ever since leaving Queen\u2019s, but his mother had concluded it was high time he gave it up and turned his attention to learning how to be a minister. Poor Moody Spurgeon fell on hard luck at the very beginning of his college career. Half a dozen ruthless Sophs, who were among his fellow-boarders, swooped down upon him one night and shaved half of his head. In this guise the luckless Moody Spurgeon had to go about until his hair grew again. He told Anne bitterly that there were times when he had his doubts as to whether he was really called to be a minister.", "5": "Aunt Jamesina did not come until the girls had Patty\u2019s Place ready for her.

The living room had been newly papered five years before and she and Miss Maria did not want any more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely necessary. For the rest she trusted everything to Anne.", "6": "How those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order! As Phil said, it was almost as good as getting married.

The gruff old millionaire who lived \u201cnext door\u201d came over and wanted to buy the gorgeous red and yellow \u201ctulip-pattern\u201d one which Mrs. Rachel had given Anne. He said his mother used to make quilts like that, and by Jove, he wanted one to remind him of her. Anne would not sell it, much to his disappointment, but she wrote all about it to Mrs. Lynde.

Patty\u2019s Place for all its many virtues, had its faults also. It was really a rather cold house; and when the frosty nights came the girls were very glad to snuggle down under Mrs. Lynde\u2019s quilts, and hoped that the loan of them might be accounted unto her for righteousness. Anne had the blue room she had coveted at sight. Priscilla and Stella had the large one. Phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen; and Aunt Jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the living-room. Rusty at first slept on the doorstep.", "12": "Anne, walking home from Redmond a few days after her return, became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert, indulgent smile.

Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of Patty\u2019s Place, which she coldly shut in his face, fondly supposing she had seen the last of him. But when, fifteen minutes later, Phil opened the door, there sat the rusty-brown cat on the step.

In the morning he was still on the doorstep. On the doorstep he continued to sit, bolting in whenever the door was opened. No coolness of welcome had the least effect on him; of nobody save Anne did he take the least notice. Out of compassion the girls fed him; but when a week had passed they decided that something must be done. The cat\u2019s appearance had improved. His eye and cheek had resumed their normal appearance; he was not quite so thin; and he had been seen washing his face.", "23": "\u201cBut for all that we can\u2019t keep him,\u201d said Stella. \u201cAunt Jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the Sarah-cat with her.

How can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who won\u2019t be got rid of?\u201d", "25": "\u201cWe must chloroform him,\u201d said Phil briskly. \u201cThat is the most humane way.\u201d", "26": "\u201cWho of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat?\u201d demanded Anne gloomily.", "27": "\u201cI do, honey. It\u2019s one of my few\u2014sadly few\u2014useful accomplishments. I\u2019ve disposed of several at home. You take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast. Then you take an old burlap bag\u2014there\u2019s one in the back porch\u2014put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box. Then take a two-ounce bottle of chloroform, uncork it, and slip it under the edge of the box. Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening. The cat will be dead, curled up peacefully as if he were asleep. No pain\u2014no struggle.\u201d", "28": "\u201cIt sounds easy,\u201d said Anne dubiously.", "29": "\u201cIt IS easy. Just leave it to me. I\u2019ll see to it,\u201d said Phil reassuringly.", "30": "Accordingly the chloroform was procured, and the next morning Rusty was lured to his doom.

How could she be a party to this destruction?", "31": "\u201cHere, take him,\u201d she said hastily to Phil. \u201cI feel like a murderess.\u201d", "32": "\u201cHe won\u2019t suffer, you know,\u201d comforted Phil, but Anne had fled.", "33": "The fatal deed was done in the back porch. Nobody went near it that day. But at dusk Phil declared that Rusty must be buried.", "34": "\u201cPris and Stella must dig his grave in the orchard,\u201d declared Phil, \u201cand Anne must come with me to lift the box off. That\u2019s the part I always hate.\u201d", "35": "The two conspirators tip-toed reluctantly to the back porch. Phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box. Suddenly, faint but distinct, sounded an unmistakable mew under the box.", "36": "\u201cHe\u2014he isn\u2019t dead,\u201d gasped Anne, sitting blankly down on the kitchen doorstep.", "37": "\u201cHe must be,\u201d said Phil incredulously.", "38": "Another tiny mew proved that he wasn\u2019t. The two girls stared at each other.", "39": "\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d questioned Anne.", "40": "\u201cWhy in the world don\u2019t you come?\u201d demanded Stella, appearing in the doorway. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the grave ready. \u2018What silent still and silent all?\u2019\u201d she quoted teasingly.", "41": "\u201c\u2018Oh, no, the voices of the dead Sound like the distant torrent\u2019s fall,\u2019\u201d promptly counter-quoted Anne, pointing solemnly to the box.", "42": "A burst of laughter broke the tension.", "43": "\u201cWe must leave him here till morning,\u201d said Phil, replacing the stone. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t mewed for five minutes. Perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan. Or perhaps we merely imagined them, under the strain of our guilty consciences.\u201d", "44": "But, when the box was lifted in the morning, Rusty bounded at one gay leap to Anne\u2019s shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately. Never was there a cat more decidedly alive.", "45": "\u201cHere\u2019s a knot hole in the box,\u201d groaned Phil. \u201cI never saw it. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t die. Now, we\u2019ve got to do it all over again.\u201d", "46": "\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d declared Anne suddenly. \u201cRusty isn\u2019t going to be killed again. He\u2019s my cat\u2014and you\u2019ve just got to make the best of it.\u201d", "47": "\u201cOh, well, if you\u2019ll settle with Aunt Jimsie and the Sarah-cat,\u201d said Stella, with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair.", "48": "From that time Rusty was one of the family. He slept o\u2019nights on the scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land. By the time Aunt Jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably respectable. But, like Kipling\u2019s cat, he \u201cwalked by himself.\u201d His paw was against every cat, and every cat\u2019s paw against him. One by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of Spofford Avenue. As for human beings, he loved Anne and Anne alone. Nobody else even dared stroke him. An angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did.", "49": "\u201cThe airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable,\u201d declared Stella.", "50": "\u201cHim was a nice old pussens, him was,\u201d vowed Anne, cuddling her pet defiantly.", "51": "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how he and the Sarah-cat will ever make out to live together,\u201d said Stella pesimistically. \u201cCat-fights in the orchard o\u2019nights are bad enough. But cat-fights here in the livingroom are unthinkable.\u201d In due time Aunt Jamesina arrived. Anne and Priscilla and Phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously; but when Aunt Jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her.", "52": "Aunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little, softly-triangular face, and large, soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth, and as full of hopes as a girl\u2019s. She had pink cheeks and snow-white hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears.", "53": "\u201cIt\u2019s a very old-fashioned way,\u201d she said, knitting industriously at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud. \u201cBut I am old-fashioned. My clothes are, and it stands to reason my opinions are, too. I don\u2019t say they\u2019re any the better of that, mind you. In fact, I daresay they\u2019re a good deal the worse. But they\u2019ve worn nice and easy. New shoes are smarter than old ones, but the old ones are more comfortable. I\u2019m old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions. I mean to take it real easy here. I know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper, but I\u2019m not going to do it. You\u2019re old enough to know how to behave if you\u2019re ever going to be. So, as far as I am concerned,\u201d concluded Aunt Jamesina, with a twinkle in her young eyes, \u201cyou can all go to destruction in your own way.\u201d", "54": "\u201cOh, will somebody separate those cats?\u201d pleaded Stella, shudderingly.", "55": "Aunt Jamesina had brought with her not only the Sarah-cat but Joseph. Joseph, she explained, had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had gone to live in Vancouver.", "56": "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t take Joseph with her so she begged me to take him. I really couldn\u2019t refuse. He\u2019s a beautiful cat\u2014that is, his disposition is beautiful. She called him Joseph because his coat is of many colors.\u201d", "57": "It certainly was. Joseph, as the disgusted Stella said, looked like a walking rag-bag. It was impossible to say what his ground color was. His legs were white with black spots on them. His back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a black patch on the other. His tail was yellow with a gray tip. One ear was black and one yellow. A black patch over one eye gave him a fearfully rakish look. In reality he was meek and inoffensive, of a sociable disposition. In one respect, if in no other, Joseph was like a lily of the field. He toiled not neither did he spin or catch mice. Yet Solomon in all his glory slept not on softer cushions, or feasted more fully on fat things.", "58": "Joseph and the Sarah-cat arrived by express in separate boxes. After they had been released and fed, Joseph selected the cushion and corner which appealed to him, and the Sarah-cat gravely sat herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face. She was a large, sleek, gray-and-white cat, with an enormous dignity which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin. She had been given to Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman.", "59": "\u201cHer name was Sarah, so my husband always called puss the Sarah-cat,\u201d explained Aunt Jamesina. \u201cShe is eight years old, and a remarkable mouser. Don\u2019t worry, Stella. The Sarah-cat NEVER fights and Joseph rarely.\u201d", "60": "\u201cThey\u2019ll have to fight here in self-defense,\u201d said Stella.", "61": "At this juncture Rusty arrived on the scene. He bounded joyously half way across the room before he saw the intruders. Then he stopped short; his tail expanded until it was as big as three tails. The fur on his back rose up in a defiant arch; Rusty lowered his head, uttered a fearful shriek of hatred and defiance, and launched himself at the Sarah-cat.", "62": "The stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking at him curiously. She met his onslaught with one contemptuous sweep of her capable paw. Rusty went rolling helplessly over on the rug; he picked himself up dazedly. What sort of a cat was this who had boxed his ears? He looked dubiously at the Sarah-cat. Would he or would he not? The Sarah-cat deliberately turned her back on him and resumed her toilet operations. Rusty decided that he would not. He never did. From that time on the Sarah-cat ruled the roost. Rusty never again interfered with her.", "63": "But Joseph rashly sat up and yawned. Rusty, burning to avenge his disgrace, swooped down upon him. Joseph, pacific by nature, could fight upon occasion and fight well. The result was a series of drawn battles. Every day Rusty and Joseph fought at sight. Anne took Rusty\u2019s part and detested Joseph. Stella was in despair. But Aunt Jamesina only laughed.", "64": "\u201cLet them fight it out,\u201d she said tolerantly. \u201cThey\u2019ll make friends after a bit. Joseph needs some exercise\u2014he was getting too fat. And Rusty has to learn he isn\u2019t the only cat in the world.\u201d", "65": "Eventually Joseph and Rusty accepted the situation and from sworn enemies became sworn friends. They slept on the same cushion with their paws about each other, and gravely washed each other\u2019s faces.", "66": "\u201cWe\u2019ve all got used to each other,\u201d said Phil. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve learned how to wash dishes and sweep a floor.\u201d", "67": "\u201cBut you needn\u2019t try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat,\u201d laughed Anne.", "68": "\u201cIt was all the fault of the knothole,\u201d protested Phil.", "69": "\u201cIt was a good thing the knothole was there,\u201d said Aunt Jamesina rather severely. \u201cKittens HAVE to be drowned, I admit, or the world would be overrun. But no decent, grown-up cat should be done to death\u2014unless he sucks eggs.\u201d", "70": "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have thought Rusty very decent if you\u2019d seen him when he came here,\u201d said Stella. \u201cHe positively looked like the Old Nick.\u201d", "71": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe Old Nick can be so very, ugly\u201d said Aunt Jamesina reflectively. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do so much harm if he was. I always think of him as a rather handsome gentleman.\u201d"}, "Chapter XVII": {"0": "\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to snow, girls,\u201d said Phil, coming in one November evening, \u201cand there are the loveliest little stars and crosses all over the garden walk. I never noticed before what exquisite things snowflakes really are. One has time to notice things like that in the simple life. Bless you all for permitting me to live it. It\u2019s really delightful to feel worried because butter has gone up five cents a pound.\u201d", "1": "\u201cHas it?\u201d demanded Stella, who kept the household accounts.", "2": "\u201cIt has\u2014and here\u2019s your butter.

She found Avonlea in the grip of such an early, cold, and stormy winter as even the \u201coldest inhabitant\u201d could not recall. Green Gables was literally hemmed in by huge drifts. Almost every day of that ill-starred vacation it stormed fiercely; and even on fine days it drifted unceasingly. No sooner were the roads broken than they filled in again. It was almost impossible to stir out. The A.V.I.S. tried, on three evenings, to have a party in honor of the college students, and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could go, so they gave up the attempt in despair. Anne, despite her love of and loyalty to Green Gables, could not help thinking longingly of Patty\u2019s Place, its cosy open fire, Aunt Jamesina\u2019s mirthful eyes, the three cats, the merry chatter of the girls, the pleasantness of Friday evenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay.", "3": "Anne was lonely; Diana, during the whole of the holidays, was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis. She could not come to Green Gables and it was rarely Anne could get to Orchard Slope, for the old way through the Haunted Wood was impassable with drifts, and the long way over the frozen Lake of Shining Waters was almost as bad. Ruby Gillis was sleeping in the white-heaped graveyard; Jane Andrews was teaching a school on western prairies. Gilbert, to be sure, was still faithful, and waded up to Green Gables every possible evening. But Gilbert\u2019s visits were not what they once were. Anne almost dreaded them. It was very disconcerting to look up in the midst of a sudden silence and find Gilbert\u2019s hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite unmistakable expression in their grave depths; and it was still more disconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under his gaze, just as if\u2014just as if\u2014well, it was very embarrassing. Anne wished herself back at Patty\u2019s Place, where there was always somebody else about to take the edge off a delicate situation. At Green Gables Marilla went promptly to Mrs. Lynde\u2019s domain when Gilbert came and insisted on taking the twins with her.

He reveled in getting out in the morning and shoveling out the paths to the well and henhouse. He gloried in the Christmas-tide delicacies which Marilla and Mrs. Lynde vied with each other in preparing for Anne, and he was reading an enthralling tale, in a school library book, of a wonderful hero who seemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from which he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a volcanic explosion, which blew him high and dry out of his troubles, landed him in a fortune, and closed the story with proper ECLAT.", "5": "\u201cI tell you it\u2019s a bully story, Anne,\u201d he said ecstatically. \u201cI\u2019d ever so much rather read it than the Bible.\u201d", "6": "\u201cWould you?\u201d smiled Anne.", "7": "Davy peered curiously at her.", "8": "\u201cYou don\u2019t seem a bit shocked, Anne.

A pale chilly moon looked out behind a bank of purple clouds in the west. The sky faded out, but the strip of yellow along the western horizon grew brighter and fiercer, as if all the stray gleams of light were concentrating in one spot; the distant hills, rimmed with priest-like firs, stood out in dark distinctness against it. Anne looked across the still, white fields, cold and lifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset, and sighed. She was very lonely; and she was sad at heart; for she was wondering if she would be able to return to Redmond next year. It did not seem likely.

There were not many\u2014only a dozen in all\u2014for Walter and Bertha Shirley had not been often separated during their courtship. The letters were yellow and faded and dim, blurred with the touch of passing years. No profound words of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages, but only lines of love and trust. The sweetness of forgotten things clung to them\u2014the far-off, fond imaginings of those long-dead lovers. Bertha Shirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the charming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time. The letters were tender, intimate, sacred. To Anne, the sweetest of all was the one written after her birth to the father on a brief absence. It was full of a proud young mother\u2019s accounts of \u201cbaby\u201d\u2014her cleverness, her brightness, her thousand sweetnesses.", "21": "\u201cI love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake,\u201d Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript. Probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned. The end was very near for her.", "22": "\u201cThis has been the most beautiful day of my life,\u201d Anne said to Phil that night. \u201cI\u2019ve FOUND my father and mother. Those letters have made them REAL to me. I\u2019m not an orphan any longer.

But her expression was very different; the something about the mouth which had hinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully; her eyes were gentler and milder, her smile more frequent and tender.", "3": "Marilla was thinking of her whole past life, her cramped but not unhappy childhood, the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes of her girlhood, the long, gray, narrow, monotonous years of dull middle life that followed.

But when she had to walk home alone from prayer meetings and A.V.I.S. pow-wows, while Diana and Fred, and many other gay couples, loitered along the dusky, starlit country roads, there was a queer, lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away. Gilbert did not even write to her, as she thought he might have done. She knew he wrote to Diana occasionally, but she would not inquire about him; and Diana, supposing that Anne heard from him, volunteered no information. Gilbert\u2019s mother, who was a gay, frank, light-hearted lady, but not overburdened with tact, had a very embarrassing habit of asking Anne, always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd, if she had heard from Gilbert lately.

I\u2019ve neglected you shamefully this summer, honey, but all my other correspondents have been neglected, too. I have a huge pile of letters to answer, so I must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in. Excuse my mixed metaphors. I\u2019m fearfully sleepy. Last night Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbor\u2019s. There were several other callers there, and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left, our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces. I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us. When we came home Mrs. Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbor\u2019s hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever. You can always trust Mrs. Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that. I have a horror of scarlet fever. I couldn\u2019t sleep when I went to bed for thinking of it. I tossed and tumbled about, dreaming fearful dreams when I did snooze for a minute; and at three I wakened up with a high fever, a sore throat, and a raging headache. I knew I had scarlet fever; I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emily\u2019s \u2018doctor book\u2019 to read up the symptoms. Anne, I had them all. So I went back to bed, and knowing the worst, slept like a top the rest of the night. Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand. But this morning I was quite well, so it couldn\u2019t have been the fever. I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldn\u2019t have developed so soon.

So a fortnight ago I came as usual. And as usual old \u2018Uncle Mark Miller\u2019 brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his \u2018generous purpose\u2019 horse. He is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints. Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy\u2014I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church. Once I asked, referring to the smell of peppermints, \u2018Is that the odor of sanctity?\u2019 I didn\u2019t like to eat Uncle Mark\u2019s peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket, and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me. But I wouldn\u2019t hurt his dear old feelings for anything, so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals. When the last one was gone, Uncle Mark said, a little rebukingly, \u2018Ye shouldn\u2019t a\u2019et all them candies to onct, Miss Phil.

I won\u2019t miss the other things. We\u2019re to be married a year from next June. Jo graduates from St. Columbia this spring, you know. Then he\u2019s going to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums. Fancy me in the slums!

I shall be poor as gaily as I\u2019ve been rich. You\u2019ll see. I\u2019m going to learn how to cook and make over dresses. I\u2019ve learned how to market since I\u2019ve lived at Patty\u2019s Place; and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole summer. Aunt Jamesina says I\u2019ll ruin Jo\u2019s career if I marry him. But I won\u2019t. I know I haven\u2019t much sense or sobriety, but I\u2019ve got what is ever so much better\u2014the knack of making people like me. There is a man in Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayer-meeting. He says, \u2018If you can\u2019t thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick.\u2019 I\u2019ll be Jo\u2019s little candlestick.\u201d", "32": "\u201cPhil, you\u2019re incorrigible.

Those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real friendship, Anne. Some day I\u2019ll look the same way at you. You\u2019re going to marry Roy, aren\u2019t you, Anne?\u201d", "34": "\u201cMy dear Philippa, did you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter, who \u2018refused a man before he\u2019d axed her\u2019? I am not going to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he \u2018axes\u2019 me.\u201d", "35": "\u201cAll Redmond knows that Roy is crazy about you,\u201d said Phil candidly. \u201cAnd you DO love him, don\u2019t you, Anne?\u201d", "36": "\u201cI\u2014I suppose so,\u201d said Anne reluctantly. She felt that she ought to be blushing while making such a confession; but she was not; on the other hand, she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about Gilbert Blythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing. Gilbert Blythe and Christine Stuart were nothing to her\u2014absolutely nothing. But Anne had given up trying to analyze the reason of her blushes. As for Roy, of course she was in love with him\u2014madly so. How could she help it? Was he not her ideal? Who could resist those glorious dark eyes, and that pleading voice? Were not half the Redmond girls wildly envious? And what a charming sonnet he had sent her, with a box of violets, on her birthday! Anne knew every word of it by heart. It was very good stuff of its kind, too. Not exactly up to the level of Keats or Shakespeare\u2014even Anne was not so deeply in love as to think that. But it was very tolerable magazine verse. And it was addressed to HER\u2014not to Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens, but to her, Anne Shirley. To be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the morning\u2014that her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrise\u2014that her lips were redder than the roses of Paradise, was thrillingly romantic. Gilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows. But then, Gilbert could see a joke. She had once told Roy a funny story\u2014and he had not seen the point of it. She recalled the chummy laugh she and Gilbert had had together over it, and wondered uneasily if life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run. But who could expect a melancholy, inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things? It would be flatly unreasonable."}, "Chapter XXVIII": {"0": "\u201cI wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always June,\u201d said Anne, as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps, where Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were sitting, talking over Mrs. Samson Coates\u2019 funeral, which they had attended that day.

Now, Fred is HOPELESSLY good.\u201d", "19": "\u201cYou\u2019ll have more sense some day, I hope,\u201d said Marilla.", "20": "Marilla spoke rather bitterly. She was grievously disappointed. She knew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe. Avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact, which had leaked out, nobody knew how. Perhaps Charlie Sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth. Perhaps Diana had betrayed it to Fred and Fred had been indiscreet. At all events it was known; Mrs. Blythe no longer asked Anne, in public or private, if she had heard lately from Gilbert, but passed her by with a frosty bow. Anne, who had always liked Gilbert\u2019s merry, young-hearted mother, was grieved in secret over this. Marilla said nothing; but Mrs. Lynde gave Anne many exasperated digs about it, until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady, through the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPherson\u2019s mother, that Anne had another \u201cbeau\u201d at college, who was rich and handsome and good all in one. After that Mrs. Rachel held her tongue, though she still wished in her inmost heart that Anne had accepted Gilbert. Riches were all very well; but even Mrs. Rachel, practical soul though she was, did not consider them the one essential. If Anne \u201cliked\u201d the Handsome Unknown better than Gilbert there was nothing more to be said; but Mrs. Rachel was dreadfully afraid that Anne was going to make the mistake of marrying for money. Marilla knew Anne too well to fear this; but she felt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly awry.", "21": "\u201cWhat is to be, will be,\u201d said Mrs. Rachel gloomily, \u201cand what isn\u2019t to be happens sometimes.

She was afraid Providence wouldn\u2019t interfere; and she didn\u2019t dare to.", "22": "Anne had wandered down to the Dryad\u2019s Bubble and was curled up among the ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert had so often sat in summers gone by. He had gone into the newspaper office again when college closed, and Avonlea seemed very dull without him. He never wrote to her, and Anne missed the letters that never came. To be sure, Roy wrote twice a week; his letters were exquisite compositions which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography. Anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them; but her heart never gave the queer, quick, painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when Mrs. Hiram Sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in Gilbert\u2019s black, upright handwriting. Anne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly\u2014to find a typewritten copy of some college society report\u2014\u201conly that and nothing more.\u201d Anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to Roy.", "23": "Diana was to be married in five more days. The gray house at Orchard Slope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing, for there was to be a big, old-timey wedding. Anne, of course, was to be bridesmaid, as had been arranged when they were twelve years old, and Gilbert was coming from Kingsport to be best man. Anne was enjoying the excitement of the various preparations, but under it all she carried a little heartache. She was, in a sense, losing her dear old chum; Diana\u2019s new home would be two miles from Green Gables, and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again. Anne looked up at Diana\u2019s light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years; but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more. Two big, painful tears welled up in her gray eyes.", "24": "\u201cOh,\u201d she thought, \u201chow horrible it is that people have to grow up\u2014and marry\u2014and CHANGE!\u201d"}, "Chapter XXIX": {"0": "\u201cAfter all, the only real roses are the pink ones,\u201d said Anne, as she tied white ribbon around Diana\u2019s bouquet in the westward-looking gable at Orchard Slope. \u201cThey are the flowers of love and faith.\u201d", "1": "Diana was standing nervously in the middle of the room, arrayed in her bridal white, her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding veil.

But, alas! I haven\u2019t the puffed sleeves\u2014though these short lace ones are even prettier.

We\u2019ve had a beautiful friendship, Diana. We\u2019ve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word; and I hope it will always be so. But things can\u2019t be quite the same after this. You\u2019ll have other interests. I\u2019ll just be on the outside. But \u2018such is life\u2019 as Mrs. Rachel says.

Come.\u201d", "12": "Following the simple, old-fashioned way in vogue then, Anne went down to the parlor on Gilbert\u2019s arm. They met at the top of the stairs for the first time since they had left Kingsport, for Gilbert had arrived only that day. Gilbert shook hands courteously. He was looking very well, though, as Anne instantly noted, rather thin. He was not pale; there was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as Anne came along the hall towards him, in her soft, white dress with lilies-of-the-valley in the shining masses of her hair. As they entered the crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room. \u201cWhat a fine-looking pair they are,\u201d whispered the impressible Mrs. Rachel to Marilla.", "13": "Fred ambled in alone, with a very red face, and then Diana swept in on her father\u2019s arm. She did not faint, and nothing untoward occurred to interrupt the ceremony. Feasting and merry-making followed; then, as the evening waned, Fred and Diana drove away through the moonlight to their new home, and Gilbert walked with Anne to Green Gables.", "14": "Something of their old comradeship had returned during the informal mirth of the evening. Oh, it was nice to be walking over that well-known road with Gilbert again!", "15": "The night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the whisper of roses in blossom\u2014the laughter of daisies\u2014the piping of grasses\u2014many sweet sounds, all tangled up together. The beauty of moonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world.", "16": "\u201cCan\u2019t we take a ramble up Lovers\u2019 Lane before you go in?\u201d asked Gilbert as they crossed the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters, in which the moon lay like a great, drowned blossom of gold.", "17": "Anne assented readily. Lovers\u2019 Lane was a veritable path in a fairyland that night\u2014a shimmering, mysterious place, full of wizardry in the white-woven enchantment of moonlight. There had been a time when such a walk with Gilbert through Lovers\u2019 Lane would have been far too dangerous. But Roy and Christine had made it very safe now. Anne found herself thinking a good deal about Christine as she chatted lightly to Gilbert. She had met her several times before leaving Kingsport, and had been charmingly sweet to her. Christine had also been charmingly sweet. Indeed, they were a most cordial pair. But for all that, their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship. Evidently Christine was not a kindred spirit.", "18": "\u201cAre you going to be in Avonlea all summer?\u201d asked Gilbert.", "19": "\u201cNo. I\u2019m going down east to Valley Road next week. Esther Haythorne wants me to teach for her through July and August. They have a summer term in that school, and Esther isn\u2019t feeling well. So I\u2019m going to substitute for her. In one way I don\u2019t mind. Do you know, I\u2019m beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now? It makes me sorry\u2014but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girls\u2014really young men and women\u2014these past two years. Half of my pupils are grown up. It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill.\u201d", "20": "Anne laughed and sighed. She felt very old and mature and wise\u2014which showed how young she was. She told herself that she longed greatly to go back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist of hope and illusion, and possessed an indefinable something that had passed away forever. Where was it now\u2014the glory and the dream?", "21": "\u201c\u2018So wags the world away,\u2019\u201d quoted Gilbert practically, and a trifle absently.

The only person in sight was an elderly woman, sitting in a wagon with mail bags piled around her. Two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her weight; her face was as round and red as a harvest-moon and almost as featureless. She wore a tight, black, cashmere dress, made in the fashion of ten years ago, a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with bows of yellow ribbon, and faded black lace mits.", "1": "\u201cHere, you,\u201d she called, waving her whip at Anne. \u201cAre you the new Valley Road schoolma\u2019am?\u201d", "2": "\u201cYes.\u201d", "3": "\u201cWell, I thought so.

Thomas wanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come. So I jest sot down and took a standing-up snack and started. I sorter like it. O\u2019 course it\u2019s rather tejus. Part of the time I sits and thinks and the rest I jest sits. Jog along, black mare. I want to git home airly. Thomas is terrible lonesome when I\u2019m away.

But when my darter\u2014she\u2019s a schoolma\u2019am like you\u2014went out West to teach I felt real lonesome and wasn\u2019t nowise sot against the idea. Bime-by Thomas began to come up and so did the other feller\u2014William Obadiah Seaman, his name was. For a long time I couldn\u2019t make up my mind which of them to take, and they kep\u2019 coming and coming, and I kep\u2019 worrying.

Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house. It was worth looking after, too, mind you that. It\u2019s a handsome house. Jog along, black mare. As for Thomas, he was poor, and if his house didn\u2019t leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it, though it looks kind of pictureaskew. But, y\u2019see, I loved Thomas, and I didn\u2019t care one red cent for W.O. So I argued it out with myself. \u2018Sarah Crowe,\u2019 say I\u2014my first was a Crowe\u2014\u2018you can marry your rich man if you like but you won\u2019t be happy.

All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past W.O.\u2018s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again. But now I never think of it at all, and I\u2019m just that comfortable and happy with Thomas.

But he\u2019s going to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now, and I guess she\u2019ll take him fast enough. She\u2019ll make him a better wife than his first did. W.O. never wanted to marry her. He just asked her to marry him \u2018cause his father wanted him to, never dreaming but that she\u2019d say \u2018no.\u2019 But mind you, she said \u2018yes.\u2019 There was a predicament for you. Jog along, black mare. She was a great housekeeper, but most awful mean. She wore the same bonnet for eighteen years. Then she got a new one and W.O. met her on the road and didn\u2019t know her.

I\u2019d rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my big house with the one I\u2019ve got.\u2019 Jane Ann\u2019s man ain\u2019t such a bad sort, nuther, though he\u2019s so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometer\u2019s at ninety. The only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite. But there ain\u2019t any love to smooth things down and it\u2019s a poor way of living. Jog along, black mare.

There\u2019s a short cut to it through the ma\u2019sh back of Janet\u2019s. If you take that way be awful keerful.

Here am I, installed once more as a country \u2018schoolma\u2019am\u2019 at Valley Road, boarding at \u2018Wayside,\u2019 the home of Miss Janet Sweet. Janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking; tall, but not over-tall; stoutish, yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois. She has a knot of soft, crimpy, brown hair with a thread of gray in it, a sunny face with rosy cheeks, and big, kind eyes as blue as forget-me-nots. Moreover, she is one of those delightful, old-fashioned cooks who don\u2019t care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things.", "2": "\u201cI like her; and she likes me\u2014principally, it seems, because she had a sister named Anne who died young.", "3": "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m real glad to see you,\u2019 she said briskly, when I landed in her yard. \u2018My, you don\u2019t look a mite like I expected.

My room is a neat little spot \u2018off the parlor\u2019\u2014just big enough for the bed and me. Over the head of my bed there is a picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Mary\u2019s grave, shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree.

Its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom. There are wonderful tidies on the chairs, and gay mats on the floor, and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table, and vases of dried grass on the mantel-piece. Between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plates\u2014five in all, pertaining respectively to Janet\u2019s father and mother, a brother, her sister Anne, and a hired man who died here once!

Now, I glory in feather-beds, and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more I glory. Janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat; she had been so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne, who wouldn\u2019t eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make Janet give up frying things.

She wore a pale-blue, pansy-sprinkled muslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical Janet could be guilty of, and a white leghorn hat with pink roses and three ostrich feathers on it. Anne felt quite amazed. Later on, she found out Janet\u2019s motive in so arraying herself\u2014a motive as old as Eden.", "1": "Valley Road prayer-meetings seemed to be essentially feminine. There were thirty-two women present, two half-grown boys, and one solitary man, beside the minister. Anne found herself studying this man. He was not handsome or young or graceful; he had remarkably long legs\u2014so long that he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of them\u2014and he was stoop-shouldered. His hands were big, his hair wanted barbering, and his moustache was unkempt. But Anne thought she liked his face; it was kind and honest and tender; there was something else in it, too\u2014just what, Anne found it hard to define. She finally concluded that this man had suffered and been strong, and it had been made manifest in his face. There was a sort of patient, humorous endurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the stake if need be, but would keep on looking pleasant until he really had to begin squirming.", "2": "When prayer-meeting was over this man came up to Janet and said,", "3": "\u201cMay I see you home, Janet?\u201d", "4": "Janet took his arm\u2014\u201cas primly and shyly as if she were no more than sixteen, having her first escort home,\u201d Anne told the girls at Patty\u2019s Place later on.", "5": "\u201cMiss Shirley, permit me to introduce Mr. Douglas,\u201d she said stiffly.", "6": "Mr. Douglas nodded and said, \u201cI was looking at you in prayer-meeting, miss, and thinking what a nice little girl you were.\u201d", "7": "Such a speech from ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have annoyed Anne bitterly; but the way in which Mr. Douglas said it made her feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment. She smiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the moonlit road.", "8": "So Janet had a beau! Anne was delighted. Janet would make a paragon of a wife\u2014cheery, economical, tolerant, and a very queen of cooks.

Janet sat and smiled, looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress, and John Douglas sat without smiling.", "18": "At the tea table Mrs. Douglas gracefully asked Janet to pour the tea.

John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago, before mother died. Well, he kept coming and coming, and after a spell I begun making quilts and things; but he never said anything about getting married, only just kept coming and coming. There wasn\u2019t anything I could do. Mother died when we\u2019d been going together for eight years. I thought he maybe would speak out then, seeing as I was left alone in the world. He was real kind and feeling, and did everything he could for me, but he never said marry. And that\u2019s the way it has been going on ever since. People blame ME for it. They say I won\u2019t marry him because his mother is so sickly and I don\u2019t want the bother of waiting on her. Why, I\u2019d LOVE to wait on John\u2019s mother! But I let them think so. I\u2019d rather they\u2019d blame me than pity me! It\u2019s so dreadful humiliating that John won\u2019t ask me. And WHY won\u2019t he?

Milton Edwards was real nice and I liked him but I didn\u2019t marry him. For one thing, he took a week to get a joke through his head, and for another he never asked me.

There were nine of them and their graves were severed far apart, ranging from Newfoundland to Vancouver.

Not all the glory that was Greece or the grandeur that was Rome could weave such wizardry as those funny, tearful tales of the Story Club.

Anne, in her flannel blouse and serge skirt, with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home, was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor, teasing the Sarah-cat with a wishbone. Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap. A warm plummy odor filled the whole house, for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen. Presently she came in, enshrouded in a huge work-apron, with a smudge of flour on her nose, to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced.", "22": "At this auspicious moment the knocker sounded.

Priscilla, who would have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door, lost her head, wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa, and dashed upstairs. Stella began feverishly gathering up her manuscript. Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil remained normal. Thanks to them, everybody was soon sitting at ease, even Anne. Priscilla came down, apronless and smudgeless, Stella reduced her corner to decency, and Phil saved the situation by a stream of ready small talk.", "24": "Mrs. Gardner was tall and thin and handsome, exquisitely gowned, cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced. Aline Gardner was a younger edition of her mother, lacking the cordiality. She endeavored to be nice, but succeeded only in being haughty and patronizing.

He had come to Patty\u2019s Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays, and they rarely met elsewhere. She knew he was studying very hard, aiming at High Honors and the Cooper Prize, and he took little part in the social doings of Redmond. Anne\u2019s own winter had been quite gay socially. She had seen a good deal of the Gardners; she and Dorothy were very intimate; college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day. Anne expected it herself. Yet just before she left Patty\u2019s Place for Convocation she flung Roy\u2019s violets aside and put Gilbert\u2019s lilies-of-the-valley in their place. She could not have told why she did it. Somehow, old Avonlea days and dreams and friendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her long-cherished ambitions. She and Gilbert had once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in Arts. The wonderful day had come and Roy\u2019s violets had no place in it. Only her old friend\u2019s flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of old-blossoming hopes which he had once shared.", "31": "For years this day had beckoned and allured to her; but when it came the one single, keen, abiding memory it left with her was not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond gave her cap and diploma and hailed her B.A.; it was not of the flash in Gilbert\u2019s eyes when he saw her lilies, nor the puzzled pained glance Roy gave her as he passed her on the platform. It was not of Aline Gardner\u2019s condescending congratulations, or Dorothy\u2019s ardent, impulsive good wishes. It was of one strange, unaccountable pang that spoiled this long-expected day for her and left in it a certain faint but enduring flavor of bitterness.", "32": "The Arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night. When Anne dressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and took from her trunk the small box that had come to Green Gables on Christmas day. In it was a thread-like gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart as a pendant. On the accompanying card was written, \u201cWith all good wishes from your old chum, Gilbert.\u201d Anne, laughing over the memory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when Gilbert had called her \u201cCarrots\u201d and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink candy heart, had written him a nice little note of thanks. But she had never worn the trinket. Tonight she fastened it about her white throat with a dreamy smile.", "33": "She and Phil walked to Redmond together. Anne walked in silence; Phil chattered of many things.

In the darkness she felt her face burning. She slipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain. One energetic twist and it gave way. Anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket. Her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting.", "38": "But she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night, and told Gilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her for a dance. Afterwards, when she sat with the girls before the dying embers at Patty\u2019s Place, removing the spring chilliness from their satin skins, none chatted more blithely than she of the day\u2019s events.", "39": "\u201cMoody Spurgeon MacPherson called here tonight after you left,\u201d said Aunt Jamesina, who had sat up to keep the fire on. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know about the graduation dance.

In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded. She was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified. It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all. Perhaps he was even engaged to her. Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart, and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love. She could do good, if not noble, work as a teacher; and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams.

It was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair, and the starry gray of her eyes and the iris-like delicacy of her skin. Gilbert, glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath, thought she had never looked so lovely. Anne, glancing sideways at Gilbert, now and then, thought how much older he looked since his illness. It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever.", "16": "The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful. Anne was almost sorry when they reached Hester Gray\u2019s garden, and sat down on the old bench. But it was beautiful there, too\u2014as beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic, when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she had found it. Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets; now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely. The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement; the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea; beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers, and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds; with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned.", "17": "\u201cI think,\u201d said Anne softly, \u201cthat \u2018the land where dreams come true\u2019 is in the blue haze yonder, over that little valley.\u201d", "18": "\u201cHave you any unfulfilled dreams, Anne?\u201d asked Gilbert.", "19": "Something in his tone\u2014something she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at Patty\u2019s Place\u2014made Anne\u2019s heart beat wildly. But she made answer lightly.", "20": "\u201cOf course. Everybody has. It wouldn\u2019t do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled. We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about. What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns. I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them. I\u2019m sure they would be very beautiful.\u201d", "21": "Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked.", "22": "\u201cI have a dream,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI persist in dreaming it, although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true. I dream of a home with a hearth-fire in it, a cat and dog, the footsteps of friends\u2014and YOU!\u201d", "23": "Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words. Happiness was breaking over her like a wave. It almost frightened her.", "24": "\u201cI asked you a question over two years ago, Anne. If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer?\u201d", "25": "Still Anne could not speak. But she lifted her eyes, shining with all the love-rapture of countless generations, and looked into his for a moment. He wanted no other answer.", "26": "They lingered in the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in Eden must have been, crept over it. There was so much to talk over and recall\u2014things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood.", "27": "\u201cI thought you loved Christine Stuart,\u201d Anne told him, as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy Gardner.", "28": "Gilbert laughed boyishly.", "29": "\u201cChristine was engaged to somebody in her home town. I knew it and she knew I knew it. When her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music, and asked me if I would look after her a bit, as she knew no one and would be very lonely. So I did. And then I liked Christine for her own sake. She is one of the nicest girls I\u2019ve ever known. I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other. I didn\u2019t care. Nothing mattered much to me for a time there, after you told me you could never love me, Anne. There was nobody else\u2014there never could be anybody else for me but you. I\u2019ve loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school.\u201d", "30": "\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little fool,\u201d said Anne.", "31": "\u201cWell, I tried to stop,\u201d said Gilbert frankly, \u201cnot because I thought you what you call yourself, but because I felt sure there was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene. But I couldn\u2019t\u2014and I can\u2019t tell you, either, what it\u2019s meant to me these two years to believe you were going to marry him, and be told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the point of being announced. I believed it until one blessed day when I was sitting up after the fever. I got a letter from Phil Gordon\u2014Phil Blake, rather\u2014in which she told me there was really nothing between you and Roy, and advised me to \u2018try again.\u2019 Well, the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that.\u201d", "32": "Anne laughed\u2014then shivered.", "33": "\u201cI can never forget the night I thought you were dying, Gilbert. Oh, I knew\u2014I KNEW then\u2014and I thought it was too late.\u201d", "34": "\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t, sweetheart. Oh, Anne, this makes up for everything, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us.\u201d", "35": "\u201cIt\u2019s the birthday of our happiness,\u201d said Anne softly. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this old garden of Hester Gray\u2019s, and now it will be dearer than ever.\u201d", "36": "\u201cBut I\u2019ll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,\u201d said Gilbert sadly. \u201cIt will be three years before I\u2019ll finish my medical course. And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls.\u201d", "37": "Anne laughed.", "38": "\u201cI don\u2019t want sunbursts and marble halls. I just want YOU. You see I\u2019m quite as shameless as Phil about it. Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well, but there is more \u2018scope for imagination\u2019 without them. And as for the waiting, that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll just be happy, waiting and working for each other\u2014and dreaming. Oh, dreams will be very sweet now.\u201d", "39": "Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her. Then they walked home together in the dusk, crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love, along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed, and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew."}}}, {"title": "Alexander's Bridge", "author": "Cather, Willa, 1873-1947", "edition": null, "pub_info": null, "form": null, "segments": {"0": {"0": "Late one brilliant April afternoon Professor Lucius Wilson stood at the head of Chestnut Street, looking about him with the pleased air of a man of taste who does not very often get to Boston. He had lived there as a student, but for twenty years and more, since he had been Professor of Philosophy in a Western university, he had seldom come East except to take a steamer for some foreign port. Wilson was standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the slanting street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses, and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still shining. The gleam of the river at the foot of the hill made him blink a little, not so much because it was too bright as because he found it so pleasant. The few passers-by glanced at him unconcernedly, and even the children who hurried along with their school-bags under their arms seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should be standing there, looking up through his glasses at the gray housetops.", "1": "The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs and the watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down the hill, descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow. His nostril, long unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood smoke in the air, blended with the odor of moist spring earth and the saltiness that came up the river with the tide. He crossed Charles Street between jangling street cars and shelving lumber drays, and after a moment of uncertainty wound into Brimmer Street. The street was quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite direction. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have slackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal, appreciative glance. She was a person of distinction he saw at once, and, moreover, very handsome. She was tall, carried her beautiful head proudly, and moved with ease and certainty. One immediately took for granted the costly privileges and fine spaces that must lie in the background from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and elegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,\u2014for, in his way, he had an eye for such things,\u2014particularly her brown furs and her hat. He got a blurred impression of her fine color, the violets she wore, her white gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a flight of steps in front of him and disappeared.", "2": "Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as completely and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long anticipated, and definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For a few pleasurable seconds he quite forgot where he was going, and only after the door had closed behind her did he realize that the young woman had entered the house to which he had directed his trunk from the South Station that morning. He hesitated a moment before mounting the steps. \u201cCan that,\u201d he murmured in amazement,\u2014\u201ccan that possibly have been Mrs. Alexander?\u201d", "3": "When the servant admitted him, Mrs. Alexander was still standing in the hallway. She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her hand.", "4": "\u201cIs it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get here before I did. I was detained at a concert, and Bartley telephoned that he would be late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather have your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with me, while we wait for Bartley?\u201d", "5": "Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid walk, and with her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He followed her through the drawing-room into the library, where the wide back windows looked out upon the garden and the sunset and a fine stretch of silver-colored river. A harp-shaped elm stood stripped against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year\u2019s birds\u2019 nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star quivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a rich and amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed in front of the wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed chair and began to pour it, while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite her and took his cup with a great sense of ease and harmony and comfort.", "6": "\u201cYou have had a long journey, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mrs. Alexander asked, after showing gracious concern about his tea. \u201cAnd I am so sorry Bartley is late. He\u2019s often tired when he\u2019s late. He flatters himself that it is a little on his account that you have come to this Congress of Psychologists.\u201d", "7": "\u201cIt is,\u201d Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; \u201cand I hope he won\u2019t be tired tonight. But, on my own account, I\u2019m glad to have a few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to know you.\u201d", "8": "\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d She nodded at him above her cup and smiled, but there was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been there when she greeted him in the hall.", "9": "Wilson leaned forward. \u201cHave I said something awkward? I live very far out of the world, you know. But I didn\u2019t mean that you would exactly fade dim, even if Bartley were here.\u201d", "10": "Mrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not so vain! How terribly discerning you are.\u201d", "11": "She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank glance brought about an understanding between them.", "12": "He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly liked her eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were like a glimpse of fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather.", "13": "\u201cSince you noticed something,\u201d Mrs. Alexander went on, \u201cit must have been a flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of the people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they were talking of someone I had never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it would seem that he grew up among the strangest people. They usually say that he has turned out very well, or remark that he always was a fine fellow. I never know what reply to make.\u201d", "14": "Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot gently. \u201cI expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well, Mrs. Alexander. Though I will say for myself that I was always confident he\u2019d do something extraordinary.\u201d", "15": "Mrs. Alexander\u2019s shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of impatience. \u201cOh, I should think that might have been a safe prediction. Another cup, please?\u201d", "16": "\u201cYes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as you might imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose their courage; and some never get a fair wind. Bartley\u201d\u2014he dropped his chin on the back of his long hand and looked at her admiringly\u2014\u201cBartley caught the wind early, and it has sung in his sails ever since.\u201d", "17": "Mrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and Wilson studied her half-averted face. He liked the suggestion of stormy possibilities in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that, he reflected, she would be too cold.", "18": "\u201cI should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy. I don\u2019t believe he remembers,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cWon\u2019t you smoke, Mr. Wilson?\u201d", "19": "Wilson lit a cigarette. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose he does. He was never introspective. He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known. We didn\u2019t know exactly what to do with him.\u201d", "20": "A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander screened her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw wavering bright spots on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened.", "21": "\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cI now and again hear stories about things that happened when he was in college.\u201d", "22": "\u201cBut that isn\u2019t what you want.\u201d Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at her with the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. \u201cWhat you want is a picture of him, standing back there at the other end of twenty years. You want to look down through my memory.\u201d", "23": "She dropped her hands in her lap. \u201cYes, yes; that\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d", "24": "At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson laughed as Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. \u201cThere he is. Away with perspective! No past, no future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The only moment that ever was or will be in the world!\u201d", "25": "The door from the hall opened, a voice called \u201cWinifred?\u201d hurriedly, and a big man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread, bringing with him a smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air. When Alexander reached the library door, he switched on the lights and stood six feet and more in the archway, glowing with strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks. There were other bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always Alexander\u2019s picture that the Sunday Supplement men wanted, because he looked as a tamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his head seemed as hard and powerful as a catapult, and his shoulders looked strong enough in themselves to support a span of any one of his ten great bridges that cut the air above as many rivers.", "26": "After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room over the library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of white lights along the Cambridge Embankment. The room was not at all what one might expect of an engineer\u2019s study. Wilson felt at once the harmony of beautiful things that have lived long together without obtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of Alexander\u2019s doing, of course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing before he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place there,\u2014that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for his vigor and vehemence. He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in the cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled above his broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth hand, a flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned.", "27": "\u201cYou are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells me.\u201d", "28": "\u201cYes, for a few weeks only. There\u2019s a meeting of British engineers, and I\u2019m doing another bridge in Canada, you know.\u201d", "29": "\u201cOh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your wife, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "30": "\u201cYes, at Allway. She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most remarkable old lady. I was working with MacKeller then, an old Scotch engineer who had picked me up in London and taken me back to Quebec with him. He had the contract for the Allway Bridge, but before he began work on it he found out that he was going to die, and he advised the committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I\u2019d never have got anything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of Mrs. Pemberton, Winifred\u2019s aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway she asked me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady.\u201d", "31": "\u201cLike her niece?\u201d Wilson queried.", "32": "Bartley laughed. \u201cShe had been very handsome, but not in Winifred\u2019s way. When I knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white, with a splendid head and a face like fine old lace, somehow,\u2014but perhaps I always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair. She had such a flavor of life about her. She had known Gordon and Livingstone and Beaconsfield when she was young,\u2014every one. She was the first woman of that sort I\u2019d ever known. You know how it is in the West,\u2014old people are poked out of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done. I used to go up from the works to have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It was very stimulating, for she couldn\u2019t tolerate stupidity.\u201d", "33": "\u201cIt must have been then that your luck began, Bartley,\u201d said Wilson, flicking his cigar ash with his long finger. \u201cIt\u2019s curious, watching boys,\u201d he went on reflectively. \u201cI\u2019m sure I did you justice in the matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot where some day strain would tell. Even after you began to climb, I stood down in the crowd and watched you with\u2014well, not with confidence. The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your facade rose, the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from top to bottom,\u201d\u2014he indicated its course in the air with his forefinger,\u2014\u201cthen a crash and clouds of dust. It was curious. I had such a clear picture of it. And another curious thing, Bartley,\u201d Wilson spoke with deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, \u201cis that I don\u2019t feel it any longer. I am sure of you.\u201d", "34": "Alexander laughed. \u201cNonsense! It\u2019s not I you feel sure of; it\u2019s Winifred. People often make that mistake.\u201d", "35": "\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Alexander. You\u2019ve changed. You have decided to leave some birds in the bushes. You used to want them all.\u201d", "36": "Alexander\u2019s chair creaked. \u201cI still want a good many,\u201d he said rather gloomily. \u201cAfter all, life doesn\u2019t offer a man much. You work like the devil and think you\u2019re getting on, and suddenly you discover that you\u2019ve only been getting yourself tied up. A million details drink you dry. Your life keeps going for things you don\u2019t want, and all the while you are being built alive into a social structure you don\u2019t care a rap about. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I\u2019d have been if I hadn\u2019t been this sort; I want to go and live out his potentialities, too. I haven\u2019t forgotten that there are birds in the bushes.\u201d", "37": "Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust forward as if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him, wondering. His old pupil always stimulated him at first, and then vastly wearied him. The machinery was always pounding away in this man, and Wilson preferred companions of a more reflective habit of mind. He could not help feeling that there were unreasoning and unreasonable activities going on in Alexander all the while; that even after dinner, when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley had merely closed the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The machinery itself was still pounding on.", "38": "Bartley\u2019s abstraction and Wilson\u2019s reflections were cut short by a rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander was standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she shook her head.", "39": "\u201cNo, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor Wilson were quite comfortable. I am going down to the music-room.\u201d", "40": "\u201cWhy not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are tired of talk.\u201d", "41": "\u201cYes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander,\u201d Wilson began, but he got no further.", "42": "\u201cWhy, certainly, if you won\u2019t find me too noisy. I am working on the Schumann `Carnival,\u2019 and, though I don\u2019t practice a great many hours, I am very methodical,\u201d Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an upright piano that stood at the back of the room, near the windows.", "43": "Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair behind her. She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling. Wilson could not imagine her permitting herself to do anything badly, but he was surprised at the cleanness of her execution. He wondered how a woman with so many duties had managed to keep herself up to a standard really professional. It must take a great deal of time, certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time. Wilson reflected that he had never before known a woman who had been able, for any considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual passion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration, shading his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even younger than in street clothes, and, for all her composure and self-sufficiency, she seemed to him strangely alert and vibrating, as if in her, too, there were something never altogether at rest. He felt that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people and what she demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten years she must know him; and however one took him, however much one admired him, one had to admit that he simply wouldn\u2019t square. He was a natural force, certainly, but beyond that, Wilson felt, he was not anything very really or for very long at a time.", "44": "Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley\u2019s profile was still wreathed in cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His shoulders were sunk deep in the cushions and one hand hung large and passive over the arm of his chair. He had slipped on a purple velvet smoking-coat. His wife, Wilson surmised, had chosen it. She was clearly very proud of his good looks and his fine color. But, with the glow of an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer\u2019s face looked tired, even a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly above the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped forward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson thought that beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling weariness of on-coming middle age.", "45": "The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden under the declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs. Alexander at the tea-table in the library.", "46": "\u201cWell,\u201d he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself, \u201cthere was a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley at his club, more psychologists, and here I am. I\u2019ve looked forward to this hour all day.\u201d", "47": "Mrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. \u201cAnd do you remember where we stopped yesterday?\u201d", "48": "\u201cPerfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I have color enough in me. Bartley makes me feel a faded monochrome. You can\u2019t get at the young Bartley except by means of color.\u201d Wilson paused and deliberated. Suddenly he broke out: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a remarkable student, you know, though he was always strong in higher mathematics. His work in my own department was quite ordinary. It was as a powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the most interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a scientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing qualities so much oftener than we find force.\u201d", "49": "\u201cAnd, after all,\u201d said Mrs. Alexander, \u201cthat is the thing we all live upon. It is the thing that takes us forward.\u201d", "50": "Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. \u201cExactly,\u201d he assented warmly. \u201cIt builds the bridges into the future, over which the feet of every one of us will go.\u201d", "51": "\u201cHow interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into the future\u2014I often say that to myself. Bartley\u2019s bridges always seem to me like that. Have you ever seen his first suspension bridge in Canada, the one he was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it sometime. We were married as soon as it was finished, and you will laugh when I tell you that it always has a rather bridal look to me. It is over the wildest river, with mists and clouds always battling about it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging in the sky. It really was a bridge into the future. You have only to look at it to feel that it meant the beginning of a great career. But I have a photograph of it here.\u201d She drew a portfolio from behind a bookcase. \u201cAnd there, you see, on the hill, is my aunt\u2019s house.\u201d", "52": "Wilson took up the photograph. \u201cBartley was telling me something about your aunt last night. She must have been a delightful person.\u201d", "53": "Winifred laughed. \u201cThe bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the hill, and the noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But after she met Bartley she pretended to like it, and said it was a good thing to be reminded that there were things going on in the world. She loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he came to the house. Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank, Early-Victorian manner. She liked men of action, and disliked young men who were careful of themselves and who, as she put it, were always trimming their wick as if they were afraid of their oil\u2019s giving out. MacKeller, Bartley\u2019s first chief, was an old friend of my aunt, and he told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which really pleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk after Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt Eleanor had found him much to her taste, but she hadn\u2019t said anything. Presently she came out, with a chuckle: `MacKeller found him sowing wild oats in London, I believe. I hope he didn\u2019t stop him too soon. Life coquets with dashing fellows. The coming men are always like that. We must have him to dinner, my dear.\u2019 And we did. She grew much fonder of Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna, and she thought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics, and she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used to declare that the Prince Consort had brought all that stuff over out of Germany. She always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him. She considered that a newfangled way of making a match of it.\u201d", "54": "When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his wife still confronting the photograph. \u201cOh, let us get that out of the way,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWinifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down. I\u2019ve decided to go over to New York to-morrow night and take a fast boat. I shall save two days.\u201d", "55": "On the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to the hotel on the Embankment at which he always stopped, and in the lobby he was accosted by an old acquaintance, Maurice Mainhall, who fell upon him with effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to dine with him. Bartley never dined alone if he could help it, and Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew what had been going on in town; especially, he knew everything that was not printed in the newspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them. He had written a number of books himself; among them a \u201cHistory of Dancing,\u201d a \u201cHistory of Costume,\u201d a \u201cKey to Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets,\u201d a study of \u201cThe Poetry of Ernest Dowson,\u201d etc. Although Mainhall\u2019s enthusiasm was often tiresome, and although he was often unable to distinguish between facts and vivid figments of his imagination, his imperturbable good nature overcame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by becoming, in a reluctant manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage-Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair. He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music. Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics. He hated them when they presumed to be anything else.", "56": "While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes of his old friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed that they should go to see Hugh MacConnell\u2019s new comedy, \u201cBog Lights.\u201d", "57": "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite the best thing MacConnell\u2019s done,\u201d he explained as they got into a hansom. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously well put on, too. Florence Merrill and Cyril Henderson. But Hilda Burgoyne\u2019s the hit of the piece. Hugh\u2019s written a delightful part for her, and she\u2019s quite inexpressible. It\u2019s been on only two weeks, and I\u2019ve been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell\u2019s box for tonight or there\u2019d be no chance of our getting places. There\u2019s everything in seeing Hilda while she\u2019s fresh in a part. She\u2019s apt to grow a bit stale after a time. The ones who have any imagination do.\u201d", "58": "\u201cHilda Burgoyne!\u201d Alexander exclaimed mildly. \u201cWhy, I haven\u2019t heard of her for\u2014years.\u201d", "59": "Mainhall laughed. \u201cThen you can\u2019t have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It\u2019s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she\u2019s come up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in London\u2014but what can one expect? Do you know, Alexander,\u201d\u2014Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,\u2014\u201cdo you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.\u201d", "60": "Just then they drove up to the Duke of York\u2019s, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre. When they entered the stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander\u2019s attention to the stage. Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he reflected, \u201cthere\u2019s small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless hasn\u2019t thought of me for years.\u201d He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell\u2019s irresistible comedy. The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey-girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing.", "61": "\u201cYou see,\u201d he murmured in Alexander\u2019s ear, as the curtain fell on the first act, \u201cone almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness. Of course, Hilda is Irish,\u2014the Burgoynes have been stage people for generations,\u2014and she has the Irish voice. It\u2019s delightful to hear it in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips\u2014who ever heard it out of Galway? She saves her hand, too. She\u2019s at her best in the second act. She\u2019s really MacConnell\u2019s poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale.\u201d", "62": "The second act opened before Philly Doyle\u2019s underground still, with Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather. Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall\u2019s sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest. As Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful brown eyes. When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar. After her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly\u2019s burrow, where she sat singing \u201cThe Rising of the Moon\u201d and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey.", "63": "When the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the corridor. They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar. Presently he hailed a tall, bearded man, grim-browed and rather battered-looking, who had his opera cloak on his arm and his hat in his hand, and who seemed to be on the point of leaving the theatre.", "64": "\u201cMacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It\u2019s going famously to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You\u2019ll never do anything like this again, mark me. A man writes to the top of his bent only once.\u201d", "65": "The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded eyes and made a wry face. \u201cAnd have I done anything so fool as that, now?\u201d he asked.", "66": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I was saying,\u201d Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never bring Hilda out like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn\u2019t possibly be better, you know.\u201d", "67": "MacConnell grunted. \u201cShe\u2019ll do well enough if she keeps her pace and doesn\u2019t go off on us in the middle of the season, as she\u2019s more than like to do.\u201d", "68": "He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.", "69": "\u201cPoor old Hugh,\u201d Mainhall murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s hit terribly hard. He\u2019s been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more. She doesn\u2019t take up with anybody, you know. Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning. One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe. I dare say it\u2019s quite true that there\u2019s never been any one else.\u201d Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him. Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: \u201cShe\u2019s an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that. Here comes Sir Harry Towne. He\u2019s another who\u2019s awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer.\u201d", "70": "Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.", "71": "Mainhall cut in impatiently.", "72": "\u201cI say, Sir Harry, the little girl\u2019s going famously to-night, isn\u2019t she?\u201d", "73": "Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously. \u201cDo you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she\u2019s feeling rather seedy, poor child. Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself. A little attack of nerves, possibly.\u201d", "74": "He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: \u201cYou know Lord Westmere, of course,\u2014the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda.\u201d", "75": "When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing \u201cThe Cloak of Old Gaul.\u201d In a moment Peggy was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest. He even leaned forward over the rail a little. For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience. In the half-light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling with amusement Sir Harry\u2019s judicial frown. He was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender, barefoot donkey-girl who slipped in and out of the play, singing, like some one winding through a hilly field. He leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as Mainhall himself when, at the end of the play, she came again and again before the curtain, panting a little and flushed, her eyes dancing and her eager, nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement.", "76": "When Alexander returned to his hotel\u2014he shook Mainhall at the door of the theatre\u2014he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late before he went to bed. He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed, he had almost forgotten her. He had last written to her from Canada, after he first met Winifred, telling her that everything was changed with him\u2014that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he could; if he could not, then all the more was everything changed for him. Hilda had never replied to his letter. He felt guilty and unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really forgot Hilda altogether. When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth. After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man. One night when he and Winifred were sitting together on the bridge, he told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for,\u2014one thing in particular,\u2014and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them. She considered a moment and then said \u201cNo, I think not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can\u2019t be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal things,\u201d\u2014here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a quick, impulsive gesture\u2014\u201coh, about those I should be very jealous. I should torture myself\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget. He wondered to-night, as he poured his wine, how many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years. He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her. \u201cAll the same,\u201d he lifted his glass, \u201chere\u2019s to you, little Hilda. You\u2019ve made things come your way, and I never thought you\u2019d do it.", "77": "\u201cOf course,\u201d he reflected, \u201cshe always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft. But I never thought she\u2019d do anything. She hadn\u2019t much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles. She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to. Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all. Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good. She was a daft, generous little thing. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s held her own since. After all, we were awfully young. It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly. I shouldn\u2019t wonder if she could laugh about it with me now. I shouldn\u2019t wonder\u2014 But they\u2019ve probably spoiled her, so that she\u2019d be tiresome if one met her again.\u201d", "78": "Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.", "79": "The next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine o\u2019clock he dropped in at the Duke of York\u2019s. The house was sold out and he stood through the second act. When he returned to his hotel he examined the new directory, and found Miss Burgoyne\u2019s address still given as off Bedford Square, though at a new number. He remembered that, in so far as she had been brought up at all, she had been brought up in Bloomsbury. Her father and mother played in the provinces most of the year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an old aunt who was crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage altogether. In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed to have a lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung tenaciously to such scraps and shreds of memories as were connected with it. The mummy room of the British Museum had been one of the chief delights of her childhood. That forbidding pile was the goal of her truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken there for a treat, as other children are taken to the theatre. It was long since Alexander had thought of any of these things, but now they came back to him quite fresh, and had a significance they did not have when they were first told him in his restless twenties. So she was still in the old neighborhood, near Bedford Square. The new number probably meant increased prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was snugly settled. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she would not be home for a good two hours yet, and he might as well walk over and have a look at the place. He remembered the shortest way.", "80": "It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went through Covent Garden to Oxford Street, and as he turned into Museum Street he walked more slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he approached the sullen gray mass at the end. He had not been inside the Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to meet there; sometimes to set out for gay adventures at Twickenham or Richmond, sometimes to linger about the place for a while and to ponder by Lord Elgin\u2019s marbles upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room, upon the awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought of the British Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things in the world were assembled to make one\u2019s hour of youth the more precious. One trembled lest before he got out it might somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness and see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet. How one hid his youth under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one\u2019s back upon all that vaulted cold, to take Hilda\u2019s arm and hurry out of the great door and down the steps into the sunlight among the pigeons\u2014to know that the warm and vital thing within him was still there and had not been snatched away to flush Caesar\u2019s lean cheek or to feed the veins of some bearded Assyrian king. They in their day had carried the flaming liquor, but to-day was his! So the song used to run in his head those summer mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked by the place very quietly, as if he were afraid of waking some one.", "81": "He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The house, a comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the four front windows on the second floor, where a low, even light was burning behind the white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were window boxes, painted white and full of flowers. Bartley was making a third round of the Square when he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a hansom-cab horse, driven rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was astonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve. He turned and walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda\u2019s number and stopped. The hansom must have been one that she employed regularly, for she did not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out quickly and lightly. He heard her cheerful \u201cGood-night, cabby,\u201d as she ran up the steps and opened the door with a latchkey. In a few moments the lights flared up brightly behind the white curtains, and as he walked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone too far to look up without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling that he had had a good evening, and he slept well.", "82": "For the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the office of a Scotch engineering firm on Henrietta Street, and was at work almost constantly. He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at his hotel. One afternoon, after he had tea, he started for a walk down the Embankment toward Westminster, intending to end his stroll at Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne would let him take her to the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached the Abbey, he turned back and crossed Westminster Bridge and sat down to watch the trails of smoke behind the Houses of Parliament catch fire with the sunset. The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little flickering flames; Somerset House and the bleached gray pinnacles about Whitehall were floated in a luminous haze. The yellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires. There was a smell of acacias in the air everywhere, and the laburnums were dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It was a sweet, lonely kind of summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she used to be, was doubtless more satisfactory than seeing her as she must be now\u2014and, after all, Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own young years that he was remembering?", "83": "He crossed back to Westminster, went up to the Temple, and sat down to smoke in the Middle Temple gardens, listening to the thin voice of the fountain and smelling the spice of the sycamores that came out heavily in the damp evening air. He thought, as he sat there, about a great many things: about his own youth and Hilda\u2019s; above all, he thought of how glorious it had been, and how quickly it had passed; and, when it had passed, how little worth while anything was. None of the things he had gained in the least compensated. In the last six years his reputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had been called to Japan to deliver, at the Emperor\u2019s request, a course of lectures at the Imperial University, and had instituted reforms throughout the islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but in drainage and road-making. On his return he had undertaken the bridge at Moorlock, in Canada, the most important piece of bridge-building going on in the world,\u2014a test, indeed, of how far the latest practice in bridge structure could be carried. It was a spectacular undertaking by reason of its very size, and Bartley realized that, whatever else he might do, he would probably always be known as the engineer who designed the great Moorlock Bridge, the longest cantilever in existence. Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had ever done. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was using lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had vexations enough, too, with his work at home. He had several bridges under way in the United States, and they were always being held up by strikes and delays resulting from a general industrial unrest.", "84": "Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work than he had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had never got so little out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the demands made on his time by boards of civic enterprise and committees of public welfare. The obligations imposed by his wife\u2019s fortune and position were sometimes distracting to a man who followed his profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many worthy endeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was becoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that success would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only power that was in itself another kind of restraint. He had always meant to keep his personal liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first chief, had done, and not, like so many American engineers, to become a part of a professional movement, a cautious board member, a Nestor de pontibus. He happened to be engaged in work of public utility, but he was not willing to become what is called a public man. He found himself living exactly the kind of life he had determined to escape. What, he asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and substantial comforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly; overwork had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which confronted him,\u2014of that he was afraid. He was not ready for it. It was like being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a thing possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to be free; and there was still something unconquered in him, something besides the strong work-horse that his profession had made of him. He felt rich to-night in the possession of that unstultified survival; in the light of his experience, it was more precious than honors or achievement. In all those busy, successful years there had been nothing so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness. This feeling was the only happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the only ones in which he could feel his own continuous identity\u2014feel the boy he had been in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked his way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris without a dollar in his pocket. The man who sat in his offices in Boston was only a powerful machine. Under the activities of that machine the person who, in such moments as this, he felt to be himself, was fading and dying. He remembered how, when he was a little boy and his father called him in the morning, he used to leap from his bed into the full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was Life itself. Whatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of concentrated thought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society; things that could be bought in the market. There was only one thing that had an absolute value for each individual, and it was just that original impulse, that internal heat, that feeling of one\u2019s self in one\u2019s own breast.", "85": "When Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were blinking along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars were shining in the wide sky above the river.", "86": "The next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish performance. It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find, and he got no farther than the Temple gardens and the Embankment. It was a pleasant kind of loneliness. To a man who was so little given to reflection, whose dreams always took the form of definite ideas, reaching into the future, there was a seductive excitement in renewing old experiences in imagination. He started out upon these walks half guiltily, with a curious longing and expectancy which were wholly gratified by solitude. Solitude, but not solitariness; for he walked shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy companion\u2014not little Hilda Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly dearer to him than she had ever been\u2014his own young self, the youth who had waited for him upon the steps of the British Museum that night, and who, though he had tried to pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked an arm in his.", "87": "It was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him this youth was the most dangerous of companions.", "88": "One Sunday evening, at Lady Walford\u2019s, Alexander did at last meet Hilda Burgoyne. Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there. He looked about for her rather nervously, and finally found her at the farther end of the large drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men, young and old. She was apparently telling them a story. They were all laughing and bending toward her. When she saw Alexander, she rose quickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a little to let him approach.", "89": "\u201cMr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?\u201d", "90": "Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. \u201cLong enough to have seen you more than once. How fine it all is!\u201d", "91": "She laughed as if she were pleased. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. I like it. Won\u2019t you join us here?\u201d", "92": "\u201cMiss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway last summer,\u201d Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again. Lord Westmere stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand and looked at Alexander blankly. Hilda was a good story-teller. She was sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a moment only. Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her slender, supple figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish skin and brown hair. Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her active, girlish body with its slender hips and quick, eager shoulders. Alexander heard little of the story, but he watched Hilda intently. She must certainly, he reflected, be thirty, and he was honestly delighted to see that the years had treated her so indulgently. If her face had changed at all, it was in a slight hardening of the mouth\u2014still eager enough to be very disconcerting at times, he felt\u2014and in an added air of self-possession and self-reliance. She carried her head, too, a little more resolutely.", "93": "When the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to Alexander, and the other men drifted away.", "94": "\u201cI thought I saw you in MacConnell\u2019s box with Mainhall one evening, but I supposed you had left town before this.\u201d", "95": "She looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an old friend whom she was glad to meet again.", "96": "\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been mooning about here.\u201d", "97": "Hilda laughed gayly. \u201cMooning! I see you mooning! You must be the busiest man in the world. Time and success have done well by you, you know. You\u2019re handsomer than ever and you\u2019ve gained a grand manner.\u201d", "98": "Alexander blushed and bowed. \u201cTime and success have been good friends to both of us. Aren\u2019t you tremendously pleased with yourself?\u201d", "99": "She laughed again and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cOh, so-so. But I want to hear about you. Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about the wonderful things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated you. What was it, Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun? That sounds like `The Mikado.\u2019 And what about your new bridge\u2014in Canada, isn\u2019t it, and it\u2019s to be the longest one in the world and has some queer name I can\u2019t remember.\u201d", "100": "Bartley shook his head and smiled drolly. \u201cSince when have you been interested in bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in everything? And is that a part of success?\u201d", "101": "\u201cWhy, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!\u201d Hilda exclaimed.", "102": "\u201cWell, I think we won\u2019t talk about bridges here, at any rate.\u201d Bartley looked down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug impatiently under the hem of her gown. \u201cBut I wonder whether you\u2019d think me impertinent if I asked you to let me come to see you sometime and tell you about them?\u201d", "103": "\u201cWhy should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons.\u201d", "104": "\u201cI know. Mainhall offered to take me. But you must know that I\u2019ve been in London several times within the last few years, and you might very well think that just now is a rather inopportune time\u2014\u201d", "105": "She cut him short. \u201cNonsense. One of the pleasantest things about success is that it makes people want to look one up, if that\u2019s what you mean. I\u2019m like every one else\u2014more agreeable to meet when things are going well with me. Don\u2019t you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do something that people like?\u201d", "106": "\u201cDoes it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I didn\u2019t want you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you.\u201d He spoke very seriously and looked down at the floor.", "107": "Hilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then broke into a low, amused laugh. \u201cMy dear Mr. Alexander, you have strange delicacies. If you please, that is exactly why you wish to see me. We understand that, do we not?\u201d", "108": "Bartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger about awkwardly.", "109": "Hilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her shrewd eyes. \u201cCome, don\u2019t be angry, but don\u2019t try to pose for me, or to be anything but what you are. If you care to come, it\u2019s yourself I\u2019ll be glad to see, and you thinking well of yourself. Don\u2019t try to wear a cloak of humility; it doesn\u2019t become you. Stalk in as you are and don\u2019t make excuses. I\u2019m not accustomed to inquiring into the motives of my guests. That would hardly be safe, even for Lady Walford, in a great house like this.\u201d", "110": "\u201cSunday afternoon, then,\u201d said Alexander, as she rose to join her hostess. \u201cHow early may I come?\u201d", "111": "She gave him her hand and flushed and laughed. He bent over it a little stiffly. She went away on Lady Walford\u2019s arm, and as he stood watching her yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather sullen. He felt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly.", "112": "On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne\u2019s invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea. Alexander arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon. Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his tea-cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep-set, faded eyes. He seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively. It was not very long, indeed, before his coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his hair and beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale. His dry humor went under a cloud of absent-minded kindliness which, Mainhall explained, always overtook him here. He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girl\u2019s party.", "113": "The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne. Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar. Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension. On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation. He looked very much like Agassiz, and his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and tight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of Mrs. Browning. Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their \u2018bus. They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda. \u201cShe\u2019s a dear, unworldly little thing,\u201d said the philosopher absently; \u201cmore like the stage people of my young days\u2014folk of simple manners. There aren\u2019t many such left. American tours have spoiled them, I\u2019m afraid. They have all grown very smart. Lamb wouldn\u2019t care a great deal about many of them, I fancy.\u201d", "114": "Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon. He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure. On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square. He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front.", "115": "When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs. Hilda was writing in her living-room, under the light of a tall desk lamp. Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady Walford\u2019s.", "116": "\u201cI\u2019m so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know,\u201d he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair. \u201cYes, it\u2019s very, very pretty. Every one at Lady Walford\u2019s was looking at it.\u201d", "117": "Hilda curtsied. \u201cIs that why you think it pretty? I\u2019ve no need for fine clothes in Mac\u2019s play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself. It\u2019s owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner. I don\u2019t need Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don\u2019t like English cookery.\u201d", "118": "Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.", "119": "\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is. Where did you get those etchings? They\u2019re quite unusual, aren\u2019t they?\u201d", "120": "\u201cLady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very much interested in the American artist who did them. They are all sketches made about the Villa d\u2019Este, you see. He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg.\u201d", "121": "Alexander walked over to the bookcases. \u201cIt\u2019s the air of the whole place here that I like. You haven\u2019t got anything that doesn\u2019t belong. Seems to me it looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many flowers. I like these little yellow irises.\u201d", "122": "\u201cRooms always look better by lamplight\u2014in London, at least. Though Marie is clean\u2014really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the flowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning.\u201d", "123": "\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d said Alexander simply. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you. You\u2019ve got awfully nice friends,\u201d he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk. \u201cThose fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They don\u2019t talk of any one else as they do of you.\u201d", "124": "Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: \u201cI\u2019ve a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It\u2019s not worth much, but I love it. I\u2019ve managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons. He\u2019s that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get. And I\u2019ve traveled a bit, too.\u201d", "125": "Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.", "126": "\u201cMy dining-room,\u201d Hilda explained, as she led the way, \u201cis the tiniest place you have ever seen.\u201d", "127": "It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf full of china. Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.", "128": "\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly rare,\u201d she said, \u201cbut some of it was my mother\u2019s. Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn\u2019t been stowed away. We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre\u2014queer theatres, for that matter.\u201d", "129": "It was a wonderful little dinner. There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond. He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.", "130": "\u201cI have some champagne for you, too. I don\u2019t drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it\u2019s poured. There is nothing else that looks so jolly.\u201d", "131": "\u201cThank you. But I don\u2019t like it so well as this.\u201d Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about. \u201cYou have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris much these late years?\u201d", "132": "Hilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully. \u201cOh, yes, I go over to Paris often. There are few changes in the old Quarter. Dear old Madame Anger is dead\u2014but perhaps you don\u2019t remember her?\u201d", "133": "\u201cDon\u2019t I, though! I\u2019m so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I remember how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed till ten o\u2019clock. He was the laziest fellow at the Beaux Arts; and that\u2019s saying a good deal.\u201d", "134": "\u201cWell, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect when he will work. He\u2019s a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever. But Angel\u2014do you remember Angel?\u201d", "135": "\u201cPerfectly. Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?\u201d", "136": "\u201cAh, no. Poor Angel! She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers in Madame Anger\u2019s little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and then with another soldier. Too bad! She still lives about the Quarter, and, though there is always a soldat, she has become a blanchisseuse de fin. She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and was so delighted to see me again. I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress. Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby\u2019s, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer.\u201d", "137": "Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low, happy laugh. \u201cHow jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down to the Place Saint-Michel to buy some lilacs. Do you remember how sweet they smelled?\u201d", "138": "\u201cIndeed I do. Come, we\u2019ll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke.\u201d", "139": "Hilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk, but Bartley found it pleasant to continue it.", "140": "\u201cWhat a warm, soft spring evening that was,\u201d he went on, as they sat down in the study with the coffee on a little table between them; \u201cand the sky, over the bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked on down by the river, didn\u2019t we?\u201d", "141": "Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly. He saw a gleam in her eyes that he remembered even better than the episode he was recalling.", "142": "\u201cI think we did,\u201d she answered demurely. \u201cIt was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc. I was frightened at your prodigality.\u201d", "143": "\u201cI expect it was the last franc I had. What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic. She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl. What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth. I remember it touched me so. I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could. I had enough and to spare then,\u201d Bartley mused, and looked thoughtfully at his cigar.", "144": "They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: \u201cGod give you a happy love!\u201d It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature\u2019s sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy. Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both. They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm. When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had kissed her for the first time. He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so\u2014", "145": "Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. \u201cDear me, why did you do that? I had quite forgotten\u2014I was back there. It was very jolly,\u201d he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.", "146": "Hilda laughed and went over to the piano. \u201cWell, we are neither of us twenty now, you know. Have I told you about my new play? Mac is writing one; really for me this time. You see, I\u2019m coming on.\u201d", "147": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear yellow gowns? I hope so.\u201d", "148": "He was looking at her round slender figure, as she stood by the piano, turning over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of it.", "149": "\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t a dress-up part. He doesn\u2019t seem to fancy me in fine feathers. He says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose I ought. But he\u2019s given me some good Irish songs. Listen.\u201d", "150": "She sat down at the piano and sang. When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.", "151": "\u201cSing `The Harp That Once,\u2019 Hilda. You used to sing it so well.\u201d", "152": "\u201cNonsense. Of course I can\u2019t really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!\u201d", "153": "Alexander laughed. \u201cAll the same, sing it, Hilda.\u201d", "154": "Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. \u201cIt\u2019s really too warm in this room to sing. Don\u2019t you feel it?\u201d", "155": "Alexander went over and opened the window for her. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck? Can\u2019t I get a scarf or something?\u201d", "156": "\u201cAsk a theatre lady if she\u2019s afraid of drafts!\u201d Hilda laughed. \u201cBut perhaps, as I\u2019m so warm\u2014give me your handkerchief. There, just in front.\u201d He slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps. \u201cThere, that will do. It looks like a bib.\u201d She pushed his hand away quickly and stood looking out into the deserted square. \u201cIsn\u2019t London a tomb on Sunday night?\u201d", "157": "Alexander caught the agitation in her voice. He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: \u201cIt\u2019s soft and misty. See how white the stars are.\u201d", "158": "For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke. They stood close together, looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more quickly and lightly, and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world had stopped. Suddenly he moved the clenched hand he held behind him and dropped it violently at his side. He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.", "159": "She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round. \u201cHere, take it. You must go now, Bartley. Good-night.\u201d", "160": "Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: \u201cYou are giving me a chance?\u201d", "161": "\u201cYes. Take it and go. This isn\u2019t fair, you know. Good-night.\u201d", "162": "Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides. With one he threw down the window and with the other\u2014still standing behind her\u2014he drew her back against him.", "163": "She uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his face down to hers. \u201cAre you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?\u201d she whispered.", "164": "It was the afternoon of the day before Christmas. Mrs. Alexander had been driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of her friends. She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she spoke to the butler: \u201cThomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see Norah. In half an hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar and put them in the library. Mr. Alexander will be home at three to hang them himself. Don\u2019t forget the stepladder, and plenty of tacks and string. You may bring the azaleas upstairs. Take the white one to Mr. Alexander\u2019s study. Put the two pink ones in this room, and the red one in the drawing-room.\u201d", "165": "A little before three o\u2019clock Mrs. Alexander went into the library to see that everything was ready. She pulled the window shades high, for the weather was dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in the streets. A foot of snow had fallen during the morning, and the wide space over the river was thick with flying flakes that fell and wreathed the masses of floating ice. Winifred was standing by the window when she heard the front door open. She hurried to the hall as Alexander came stamping in, covered with snow. He kissed her joyfully and brushed away the snow that fell on her hair.", "166": "\u201cI wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me, Winifred. The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the pond and are skating furiously. Did the cyclamens come?\u201d", "167": "\u201cAn hour ago. What splendid ones! But aren\u2019t you frightfully extravagant?\u201d", "168": "\u201cNot for Christmas-time. I\u2019ll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall be down in a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready.\u201d", "169": "When Alexander reappeared, he took his wife\u2019s arm and went with her into the library. \u201cWhen did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the white one in my room.\u201d", "170": "\u201cI told him to put it there.\u201d", "171": "\u201cBut, I say, it\u2019s much the finest of the lot!\u201d", "172": "\u201cThat\u2019s why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room for a red one, you know.\u201d", "173": "Bartley began to sort the greens. \u201cIt looks very splendid there, but I feel piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than anywhere else in the house. Will you hand me the holly?\u201d", "174": "He climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began to twist the tough stems of the holly into the frame-work of the chandelier.", "175": "\u201cI forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning, explaining his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in Vermont has conveniently died and left Wilson a little money\u2014something like ten thousand. He\u2019s coming on to settle up the estate. Won\u2019t it be jolly to have him?\u201d", "176": "\u201cAnd how fine that he\u2019s come into a little money. I can see him posting down State Street to the steamship offices. He will get a good many trips out of that ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected him here for luncheon.\u201d", "177": "\u201cThose trains from Albany are always late. He\u2019ll be along sometime this afternoon. And now, don\u2019t you want to go upstairs and lie down for an hour? You\u2019ve had a busy morning and I don\u2019t want you to be tired to-night.\u201d", "178": "After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the greens for a few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of string, he sighed suddenly and sat down, staring out of the window at the snow. The animation died out of his face, but in his eyes there was a restless light, a look of apprehension and suspense. He kept clasping and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to realize something. The clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the afternoon outside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he first sat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself away from his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in which he sat, from everything except the wild eddies of snow above the river on which his eyes were fixed with feverish intentness, as if he were trying to project himself thither. When at last Lucius Wilson was announced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet and hurried to meet his old instructor.", "179": "\u201cHello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot of people to dinner to-night, and Winifred\u2019s lying down. You will excuse her, won\u2019t you? And now what about yourself? Sit down and tell me everything.\u201d", "180": "\u201cI think I\u2019d rather move about, if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve been sitting in the train for a week, it seems to me.\u201d Wilson stood before the fire with his hands behind him and looked about the room. \u201cYou HAVE been busy. Bartley, if I\u2019d had my choice of all possible places in which to spend Christmas, your house would certainly be the place I\u2019d have chosen. Happy people do a great deal for their friends. A house like this throws its warmth out. I felt it distinctly as I was coming through the Berkshires. I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs. Bartley again so soon.\u201d", "181": "\u201cThank you, Wilson. She\u2019ll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea now? I\u2019ll ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I always wreck the house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am quite tired. Looks as if I were not used to work, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Alexander laughed and dropped into a chair. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sailing the day after New Year\u2019s.\u201d", "182": "\u201cAgain? Why, you\u2019ve been over twice since I was here in the spring, haven\u2019t you?\u201d", "183": "\u201cOh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the hot weather more than anything else. I shan\u2019t be gone more than a month this time. Winifred and I have been up in Canada for most of the autumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on my back all the time. I never had so much trouble with a job before.\u201d Alexander moved about restlessly and fell to poking the fire.", "184": "\u201cHaven\u2019t I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about a tidewater bridge of yours in New Jersey?\u201d", "185": "\u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t amount to anything. It\u2019s held up by a steel strike. A bother, of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up with. But the Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety. You see, the truth is, we are having to build pretty well to the strain limit up there. They\u2019ve crowded me too much on the cost. It\u2019s all very well if everything goes well, but these estimates have never been used for anything of such length before. However, there\u2019s nothing to be done. They hold me to the scale I\u2019ve used in shorter bridges. The last thing a bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build.\u201d", "186": "When Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study, where he found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table.", "187": "\u201cThese pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201cand I am sure she meant them for you.\u201d", "188": "Bartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the wreaths in the windows. \u201cHave you a moment, Winifred? I have just now been thinking that this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?\u201d He went up to the table and took her hands away from the flowers, drying them with his pocket handkerchief. \u201cThey\u2019ve been awfully happy ones, all of them, haven\u2019t they?\u201d He took her in his arms and bent back, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss. \u201cYou are happy, aren\u2019t you Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you to be happy. Sometimes, of late, I\u2019ve thought you looked as if you were troubled.\u201d", "189": "\u201cNo; it\u2019s only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried, Bartley. I wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don\u2019t, always.\u201d She looked earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes.", "190": "Alexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and forth in his own, laughing his big blond laugh.", "191": "\u201cI\u2019m growing older, my dear; that\u2019s what you feel. Now, may I show you something? I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear them to-night.\u201d He took a little leather box out of his pocket and opened it. On the white velvet lay two long pendants of curiously worked gold, set with pearls. Winifred looked from the box to Bartley and exclaimed:\u2014", "192": "\u201cWhere did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?\u201d", "193": "\u201cIt\u2019s old Flemish. Isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d", "194": "\u201cThey are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear earrings.\u201d", "195": "\u201cYes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted you to. So few women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with, and a nose\u201d\u2014he waved his hand\u2014\u201cabove reproach. Most women look silly in them. They go only with faces like yours\u2014very, very proud, and just a little hard.\u201d", "196": "Winifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate springs to the lobes of her ears. \u201cOh, Bartley, that old foolishness about my being hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down now. People are beginning to come.\u201d", "197": "Bartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her. \u201cNot hard to me, Winifred,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNever, never hard to me.\u201d", "198": "Left alone, he paced up and down his study. He was at home again, among all the dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years. His house to-night would be full of charming people, who liked and admired him. Yet all the time, underneath his pleasure and hopefulness and satisfaction, he was conscious of the vibration of an unnatural excitement. Amid this light and warmth and friendliness, he sometimes started and shuddered, as if some one had stepped on his grave. Something had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except that it was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him. Sometimes it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries. Sometimes it battered him like the cannon rolling in the hold of the vessel. Always, now, it brought with it a sense of quickened life, of stimulating danger. To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he was walking the floor, after his wife left him. It seemed impossible; he could not believe it. He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her back. He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down. Going over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river. How could this happen here, in his own house, among the things he loved? What was it that reached in out of the darkness and thrilled him? As he stood there he had a feeling that he would never escape. He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead against the cold window glass, breathing in the chill that came through it. \u201cThat this,\u201d he groaned, \u201cthat this should have happened to ME!\u201d", "199": "On New Year\u2019s day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain fell. In the morning, the morning of Alexander\u2019s departure for England, the river was streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the windows of the breakfast-room. Alexander had finished his coffee and was pacing up and down. His wife sat at the table, watching him. She was pale and unnaturally calm. When Thomas brought the letters, Bartley sank into his chair and ran them over rapidly.", "200": "\u201cHere\u2019s a note from old Wilson. He\u2019s safe back at his grind, and says he had a bully time. `The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole winter fragrant.\u2019 Just like him. He will go on getting measureless satisfaction out of you by his study fire. What a man he is for looking on at life!\u201d Bartley sighed, pushed the letters back impatiently, and went over to the window. \u201cThis is a nasty sort of day to sail. I\u2019ve a notion to call it off. Next week would be time enough.\u201d", "201": "\u201cThat would only mean starting twice. It wouldn\u2019t really help you out at all,\u201d Mrs. Alexander spoke soothingly. \u201cAnd you\u2019d come back late for all your engagements.\u201d", "202": "Bartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket. \u201cI wish things would let me rest. I\u2019m tired of work, tired of people, tired of trailing about.\u201d He looked out at the storm-beaten river.", "203": "Winifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what you always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these things. Can\u2019t you remember that?\u201d", "204": "He put his arm about her. \u201cAll the same, life runs smoothly enough with some people, and with me it\u2019s always a messy sort of patchwork. It\u2019s like the song; peace is where I am not. How can you face it all with so much fortitude?\u201d", "205": "She looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much admired, which he had felt implied such high confidence and fearless pride. \u201cOh, I faced that long ago, when you were on your first bridge, up at old Allway. I knew then that your paths were not to be paths of peace, but I decided that I wanted to follow them.\u201d", "206": "Bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in the grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy Angora looked up at them curiously.", "207": "Presently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door. \u201cShall Edward bring down your trunks, sir?\u201d", "208": "\u201cYes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study table.\u201d", "209": "Thomas withdrew, closing the door softly. Bartley turned away from his wife, still holding her hand. \u201cIt never gets any easier, Winifred.\u201d", "210": "They both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside. Alexander sat down and leaned his head on his hand. His wife bent over him. \u201cCourage,\u201d she said gayly. Bartley rose and rang the bell. Thomas brought him his hat and stick and ulster. At the sight of these, the supercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted her red cushion by the fire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous indications of change. Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then plunged into his coat and drew on his gloves. His wife held his stick, smiling. Bartley smiled too, and his eyes cleared. \u201cI\u2019ll work like the devil, Winifred, and be home again before you realize I\u2019ve gone.\u201d He kissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the front door into the rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was starting his melancholy, dripping black horses. Alexander sat with his hands clenched on his knees. As the carriage turned up the hill, he lifted one hand and brought it down violently. \u201cThis time\u201d\u2014he spoke aloud and through his set teeth\u2014\u201cthis time I\u2019m going to end it!\u201d", "211": "On the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well to the stern, on the windward side where the chairs were few, his rugs over him and the collar of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears. The weather had so far been dark and raw. For two hours he had been watching the low, dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the iron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that made exercise laborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid that drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache. He seldom moved except to brush them away. The great open spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him. He intended during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion. Deep down in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and strengthening, ebbing and flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on as steadily as his pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was submerged in the vast impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals the sidelong roll of the boat measured off time like the ticking of a clock. He felt released from everything that troubled and perplexed him. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted torturing memories, had actually managed to get on board without them. He thought of nothing at all. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the grayness, it was Lucius Wilson\u2019s, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten for years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to hunt jack-rabbits with when he was a boy.", "212": "Toward six o\u2019clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and brought the swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet deck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing himself in the obliterating blackness and drowsing in the rush of the gale. Before he went below a few bright stars were pricked off between heavily moving masses of cloud.", "213": "The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander felt the need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he went on deck the sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white cloud, smoke-colored at the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water was roughish, a cold, clear indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley walked for two hours, and then stretched himself in the sun until lunch-time.", "214": "In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he walked the deck through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose continually. It was agreeable to come to himself again after several days of numbness and torpor. He stayed out until the last tinge of violet had faded from the water. There was literally a taste of life on his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of champagne. He was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than he had meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was almost deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy fur coat about his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen exhilaration. The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the shelter of the stern, the wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of warm air, a sense of close and intimate companionship. He started back and tore his coat open as if something warm were actually clinging to him beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went into the saloon parlor, full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp wind. He threw himself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and played accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had followed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He played bridge until two o\u2019clock in the morning, and managed to lose a considerable sum of money without really noticing that he was doing so.", "215": "After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently dull. When the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun did no more than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark brightness of newly cut lead. Through one after another of those gray days Alexander drowsed and mused, drinking in the grateful moisture. But the complete peace of the first part of the voyage was over. Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if driven out, and paced the deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for walking in rough weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied he must be thinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever bridge in Canada.", "216": "But Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night out, when his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been continually hammering away at himself. More and more often, when he first wakened in the morning or when he stepped into a warm place after being chilled on the deck, he felt a sudden painful delight at being nearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most despondent, when he thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a flash he was free of it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness of himself. On the instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness, the intense excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth.", "217": "The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience. He had planned to stop in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.", "218": "Emerging at Euston at half-past three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square. When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight. She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda\u2019s living-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in. She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder. \u201cOh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like this? Come over to the fire; you\u2019re chilled through.\u201d", "219": "She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.", "220": "\u201cWhen did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven\u2019t spoken a word.\u201d", "221": "\u201cI got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train.\u201d", "222": "Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze. Hilda watched him with perplexity.", "223": "\u201cThere\u2019s something troubling you, Bartley. What is it?\u201d", "224": "Bartley bent lower over the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda. You and I.\u201d", "225": "Hilda took a quick, soft breath. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.", "226": "\u201cWhat about us, Bartley?\u201d she asked in a thin voice.", "227": "He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window. At last Alexander brought out one word:\u2014", "228": "\u201cEverything!\u201d", "229": "Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright. She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley. She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.", "230": "\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,\u201d she said tremulously. \u201cI can\u2019t stand seeing you miserable.\u201d", "231": "\u201cI can\u2019t live with myself any longer,\u201d he answered roughly.", "232": "He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him. He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.", "233": "Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.", "234": "\u201cIt . . . it hasn\u2019t always made you miserable, has it?\u201d Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.", "235": "\u201cAlways. But it\u2019s worse now. It\u2019s unbearable. It tortures me every minute.\u201d", "236": "\u201cBut why NOW?\u201d she asked piteously, wringing her hands.", "237": "He ignored her question. \u201cI am not a man who can live two lives,\u201d he went on feverishly. \u201cEach life spoils the other. I get nothing but misery out of either. The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can\u2019t get at it any more. There is this deception between me and everything.\u201d", "238": "At that word \u201cdeception,\u201d spoken with such self-contempt, the color flashed back into Hilda\u2019s face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash. She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.", "239": "\u201cCould you\u2014could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?\u201d", "240": "He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire. \u201cIt was myself I was defying, Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out.\u201d", "241": "He looked at her and his haggard face softened. He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.", "242": "She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her. \u201cWhen did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?\u201d", "243": "\u201cAfter the very first. The first was\u2014sort of in play, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "244": "Hilda\u2019s face quivered, but she whispered: \u201cYes, I think it must have been. But why didn\u2019t you tell me when you were here in the summer?\u201d", "245": "Alexander groaned. \u201cI meant to, but somehow I couldn\u2019t. We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy.\u201d", "246": "\u201cYes, I was happy, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. \u201cWeren\u2019t you happy then, at all?\u201d", "247": "She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days. Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too. He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.", "248": "\u201cYes, I was then. You know. But afterward. . .\u201d", "249": "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve. \u201cPlease tell me one thing, Bartley. At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.\u201d", "250": "His hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeves. \u201cYes, Hilda; I know that,\u201d he said simply.", "251": "She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:\u2014", "252": "\u201cYou see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything. I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too. I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you. I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful\u2014to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted.\u201d", "253": "Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.", "254": "\u201cI understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I didn\u2019t know. You\u2019ve only to tell me now. What must I do that I\u2019ve not done, or what must I not do?\u201d She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair. \u201cYou want me to say it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people? I can do that.\u201d", "255": "\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said heavily.", "256": "Hilda shivered and sat still. Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can\u2019t see you at all, anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.\u201d", "257": "Hilda sprang up like a flame. She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.", "258": "\u201cNo!\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to ask that. Do you hear me, Bartley? It\u2019s too late. I won\u2019t promise. It\u2019s abominable of you to ask me. Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you? But, if you come to me, I\u2019ll do as I see fit. The shamefulness of your asking me to do that! If you come to me, I\u2019ll do as I see fit. Do you understand? Bartley, you\u2019re cowardly!\u201d", "259": "Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. \u201cYes, I know I\u2019m cowardly. I\u2019m afraid of myself. I don\u2019t trust myself any more. I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don\u2019t dare trifle with it. It\u2019s getting the better of me. It\u2019s different now. I\u2019m growing older, and you\u2019ve got my young self here with you. It\u2019s through him that I\u2019ve come to wish for you all and all the time.\u201d He took her roughly in his arms. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d", "260": "Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly. \u201cOh, Bartley, what am I to do? Why didn\u2019t you let me be angry with you? You ask me to stay away from you because you want me! And I\u2019ve got nobody but you. I will do anything you say\u2014but that! I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!\u201d", "261": "Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again. Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.", "262": "\u201cJust something Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful\u2014can I never make you understand what that means to me?\u201d She pressed his shoulders gently. \u201cYou see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different. If I\u2019d met you later, if I hadn\u2019t loved you so well\u2014but that\u2019s all over, long ago. Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding\u2014hard as a steel spring. And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference.\u201d", "263": "She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer. Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.", "264": "\u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ve tortured each other enough for tonight. Forget everything except that I am here.\u201d", "265": "\u201cI think I have forgotten everything but that already,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAh, your dear arms!\u201d", "266": "During the fortnight that Alexander was in London he drove himself hard. He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great many men who were doing interesting things in his own profession. He disliked to think of his visits to London as holidays, and when he was there he worked even harder than he did at home.", "267": "The day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one. The thick air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a golden dawn and then fell off to a fresh breeze. When Bartley looked out of his windows from the Savoy, the river was flashing silver and the gray stone along the Embankment was bathed in bright, clear sunshine. London had wakened to life after three weeks of cold and sodden rain. Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and went over his mail while the hotel valet packed his trunks. Then he paid his account and walked rapidly down the Strand past Charing Cross Station. His spirits rose with every step, and when he reached Trafalgar Square, blazing in the sun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the bright air, he signaled to a hansom, and, before he knew what he was about, told the driver to go to Bedford Square by way of the British Museum.", "268": "When he reached Hilda\u2019s apartment she met him, fresh as the morning itself. Her rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he had been sending her. She would never let him give her anything else.", "269": "\u201cAre you busy this morning, Hilda?\u201d he asked as he sat down, his hat and gloves in his hand.", "270": "\u201cVery. I\u2019ve been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open in February, you know.\u201d", "271": "\u201cWell, then you\u2019ve worked enough. And so have I. I\u2019ve seen all my men, my packing is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening. But this morning we are going to have a holiday. What do you say to a drive out to Kew and Richmond? You may not get another day like this all winter. It\u2019s like a fine April day at home. May I use your telephone? I want to order the carriage.\u201d", "272": "\u201cOh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are telephoning I\u2019ll change my dress. I shan\u2019t be long. All the morning papers are on the table.\u201d", "273": "Hilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a broad fur hat.", "274": "Bartley rose and inspected her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear some of those pink roses?\u201d he asked.", "275": "\u201cBut they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open. I was saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!\u201d She laughed as she looked about the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sending me far too many flowers, Bartley. New ones every day. That\u2019s too often; though I do love to open the boxes, and I take good care of them.\u201d", "276": "\u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you are so fond of? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures.\u201d", "277": "Hilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass. \u201cNo, there are some things you can\u2019t do. There\u2019s the carriage. Will you button my gloves for me?\u201d", "278": "Bartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove. \u201cHow gay your eyes are this morning, Hilda.\u201d", "279": "\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ve been studying. It always stirs me up a little.\u201d", "280": "He pushed the top of the glove up slowly. \u201cWhen did you learn to take hold of your parts like that?\u201d", "281": "\u201cWhen I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting. What a shocking while you take.\u201d", "282": "\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry. We\u2019ve plenty of time.\u201d", "283": "They found all London abroad. Piccadilly was a stream of rapidly moving carriages, from which flashed furs and flowers and bright winter costumes. The metal trappings of the harnesses shone dazzlingly, and the wheels were revolving disks that threw off rays of light. The parks were full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs that leaped and yelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws.", "284": "\u201cI\u2019m not going until to-morrow, you know,\u201d Bartley announced suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll cut off a day in Liverpool. I haven\u2019t felt so jolly this long while.\u201d", "285": "Hilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad. \u201cI think people were meant to be happy, a little,\u201d she said.", "286": "They had lunch at Richmond and then walked to Twickenham, where they had sent the carriage. They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind them, toward the distant gold-washed city. It was one of those rare afternoons when all the thickness and shadow of London are changed to a kind of shining, pulsing, special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors become fluttering golden clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when all that bleakness of gray stone and dullness of dirty brick trembles in aureate light, and all the roofs and spires, and one great dome, are floated in golden haze. On such rare afternoons the ugliest of cities becomes the most poetic, and months of sodden days are offset by a moment of miracle.", "287": "\u201cIt\u2019s like that with us Londoners, too,\u201d Hilda was saying. \u201cEverything is awfully grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways of amusing ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody. We can go mad with joy, as the people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday. We make the most of our moment.\u201d", "288": "She thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and Bartley looked down at her and laughed.", "289": "\u201cYou are a plucky one, you.\u201d He patted her glove with his hand. \u201cYes, you are a plucky one.\u201d", "290": "Hilda sighed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Not about some things, at any rate. It doesn\u2019t take pluck to fight for one\u2019s moment, but it takes pluck to go without\u2014a lot. More than I have. I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she added fiercely.", "291": "After miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached London itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming up from the river, that betokened fog again to-morrow. The streets were full of people who had worked indoors all through the priceless day and had now come hungrily out to drink the muddy lees of it. They stood in long black lines, waiting before the pit entrances of the theatres\u2014short-coated boys, and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and chatting gayly. There was a blurred rhythm in all the dull city noises\u2014in the clatter of the cab horses and the rumbling of the busses, in the street calls, and in the undulating tramp, tramp of the crowd. It was like the deep vibration of some vast underground machinery, and like the muffled pulsations of millions of human hearts.", "292": "[See \u201cThe Barrel Organ by Alfred Noyes. Ed.] [I have placed it at the end for your convenience]", "293": "\u201cSeems good to get back, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Bartley whispered, as they drove from Bayswater Road into Oxford Street. \u201cLondon always makes me want to live more than any other city in the world. You remember our priestess mummy over in the mummy-room, and how we used to long to go and bring her out on nights like this? Three thousand years! Ugh!\u201d", "294": "\u201cAll the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and watched her and wished her well. I believe she used to remember,\u201d Hilda said thoughtfully.", "295": "\u201cI hope so. Now let\u2019s go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before we go home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night. Where shall I tell the driver? The Piccadilly Restaurant? The music\u2019s good there.\u201d", "296": "\u201cThere are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little French place in Soho, where we went so often when you were here in the summer? I love it, and I\u2019ve never been there with any one but you. Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely.\u201d", "297": "\u201cVery well, the sole\u2019s good there. How many street pianos there are about to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We\u2019ve had five miles of `Il Trovatore\u2019 now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are you comfy, and not too tired?\u201d", "298": "\u201cI\u2019m not tired at all. I was just wondering how people can ever die. Why did you remind me of the mummy? Life seems the strongest and most indestructible thing in the world. Do you really believe that all those people rushing about down there, going to good dinners and clubs and theatres, will be dead some day, and not care about anything? I don\u2019t believe it, and I know I shan\u2019t die, ever! You see, I feel too\u2014too powerful!\u201d", "299": "The carriage stopped. Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the pavement. As he lifted her in his two hands he whispered: \u201cYou are\u2014powerful!\u201d", "300": "The last rehearsal was over, a tedious dress rehearsal which had lasted all day and exhausted the patience of every one who had to do with it. When Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her dressing-room, she found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the corridor.", "301": "\u201cThe fog\u2019s thicker than ever, Hilda. There have been a great many accidents to-day. It\u2019s positively unsafe for you to be out alone. Will you let me take you home?\u201d", "302": "\u201cHow good of you, Mac. If you are going with me, I think I\u2019d rather walk. I\u2019ve had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous.\u201d", "303": "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u201d said MacConnell dryly. Hilda pulled down her veil and they stepped out into the thick brown wash that submerged St. Martin\u2019s Lane. MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was such a savage. I hope you didn\u2019t think I made an ass of myself.\u201d", "304": "\u201cNot a bit of it. I don\u2019t wonder you were peppery. Those things are awfully trying. How do you think it\u2019s going?\u201d", "305": "\u201cMagnificently. That\u2019s why I got so stirred up. We are going to hear from this, both of us. And that reminds me; I\u2019ve got news for you. They are going to begin repairs on the theatre about the middle of March, and we are to run over to New York for six weeks. Bennett told me yesterday that it was decided.\u201d", "306": "Hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her. He was the only thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense opaqueness, as if they were walking at the bottom of the ocean.", "307": "\u201cOh, Mac, how glad I am! And they love your things over there, don\u2019t they?\u201d", "308": "\u201cShall you be glad for\u2014any other reason, Hilda?\u201d", "309": "MacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object. It proved to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the edge of the pavement.", "310": "\u201cWhat do you mean, Mac?\u201d Hilda asked nervously.", "311": "\u201cI was just thinking there might be people over there you\u2019d be glad to see,\u201d he brought out awkwardly. Hilda said nothing, and as they walked on MacConnell spoke again, apologetically: \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my knowing about it, Hilda. Don\u2019t stiffen up like that. No one else knows, and I didn\u2019t try to find out anything. I felt it, even before I knew who he was. I knew there was somebody, and that it wasn\u2019t I.\u201d", "312": "They crossed Oxford Street in silence, feeling their way. The busses had stopped running and the cab-drivers were leading their horses. When they reached the other side, MacConnell said suddenly, \u201cI hope you are happy.\u201d", "313": "\u201cTerribly, dangerously happy, Mac,\u201d\u2014Hilda spoke quietly, pressing the rough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand.", "314": "\u201cYou\u2019ve always thought me too old for you, Hilda,\u2014oh, of course you\u2019ve never said just that,\u2014and here this fellow is not more than eight years younger than I. I\u2019ve always felt that if I could get out of my old case I might win you yet. It\u2019s a fine, brave youth I carry inside me, only he\u2019ll never be seen.\u201d", "315": "\u201cNonsense, Mac. That has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s because you seem too close to me, too much my own kind. It would be like marrying Cousin Mike, almost. I really tried to care as you wanted me to, away back in the beginning.\u201d", "316": "\u201cWell, here we are, turning out of the Square. You are not angry with me, Hilda? Thank you for this walk, my dear. Go in and get dry things on at once. You\u2019ll be having a great night to-morrow.\u201d", "317": "She put out her hand. \u201cThank you, Mac, for everything. Good-night.\u201d", "318": "MacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs. Her slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire. \u201cI shall certainly see him in New York. He will see by the papers that we are coming. Perhaps he knows it already,\u201d Hilda kept thinking as she undressed. \u201cPerhaps he will be at the dock. No, scarcely that; but I may meet him in the street even before he comes to see me.\u201d Marie placed the tea-table by the fire and brought Hilda her letters. She looked them over, and started as she came to one in a handwriting that she did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice before, and he did not allow her to write to him at all. \u201cThank you, Marie. You may go now.\u201d", "319": "Hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still unopened. She looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its thickness with her fingers. She believed that she sometimes had a kind of second-sight about letters, and could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings. She put this one down on the table in front of her while she poured her tea. At last, with a little shiver of expectancy, she tore open the envelope and read:\u2014", "320": "Boston, February \u2014", "321": "MY DEAR HILDA:\u2014", "322": "It is after twelve o\u2019clock. Every one else is in bed and I am sitting alone in my study. I have been happier in this room than anywhere else in the world. Happiness like that makes one insolent. I used to think these four walls could stand against anything. And now I scarcely know myself here. Now I know that no one can build his security upon the nobleness of another person. Two people, when they love each other, grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but their moral natures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never welded. The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to the end.", "323": "The last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used to be with me. Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it has been as if a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all the smells of spring blew in to me. There is a garden out there, with stars overhead, where I used to walk at night when I had a single purpose and a single heart. I can remember how I used to feel there, how beautiful everything about me was, and what life and power and freedom I felt in myself. When the window opens I know exactly how it would feel to be out there. But that garden is closed to me. How is it, I ask myself, that everything can be so different with me when nothing here has changed? I am in my own house, in my own study, in the midst of all these quiet streets where my friends live. They are all safe and at peace with themselves. But I am never at peace. I feel always on the edge of danger and change.", "324": "I keep remembering locoed horses I used to see on the range when I was a boy. They changed like that. We used to catch them and put them up in the corral, and they developed great cunning. They would pretend to eat their oats like the other horses, but we knew they were always scheming to get back at the loco.", "325": "It seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world. When he tries to live a second, he develops another nature. I feel as if a second man had been grafted into me. At first he seemed only a pleasure-loving simpleton, of whose company I was rather ashamed, and whom I used to hide under my coat when I walked the Embankment, in London. But now he is strong and sullen, and he is fighting for his life at the cost of mine. That is his one activity: to grow strong. No creature ever wanted so much to live. Eventually, I suppose, he will absorb me altogether. Believe me, you will hate me then.", "326": "And what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story? Nothing at all. The little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and he became a stag. I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and because it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer. And because I suffer, Hilda. If any one I loved suffered like this, I\u2019d want to know it. Help me, Hilda!", "327": "B.A.", "328": "On the last Saturday in April, the New York \u201cTimes\u201d published an account of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander\u2019s New Jersey bridge, and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on West Tenth Street.", "329": "On Sunday, the day after this notice appeared, Alexander worked all day at his Tenth Street rooms. His business often called him to New York, and he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length of time. Besides his sleeping-room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a painter\u2019s studio, which he used as a study and office. It was furnished with the cast-off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings. Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror. Alexander\u2019s big work-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait-painter of international renown. He had done it for Alexander when they were students together in Paris.", "330": "Sunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously. When Alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets. It was after nine o\u2019clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap. He rose and crossed the room quickly. When he threw open the door he recognized the figure that shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway. He stood for a moment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.", "331": "\u201cCome in,\u201d he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her. He pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit down?\u201d", "332": "He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously. The yellow light from the student\u2019s lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were in the shadow. There was something about him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was.", "333": "\u201cOf course I know, Bartley,\u201d she said at last, \u201cthat after this you won\u2019t owe me the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you. That\u2019s all. Good-night; I\u2019m going now.\u201d She turned and her hand closed on the door-knob.", "334": "Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm. \u201cSit down, Hilda; you\u2019re wet through. Let me take off your coat\u2014and your boots; they\u2019re oozing water.\u201d He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank into the chair. \u201cHere, put your feet on this stool. You don\u2019t mean to say you walked down\u2014and without overshoes!\u201d", "335": "Hilda hid her face in her hands. \u201cI was afraid to take a cab. Can\u2019t you see, Bartley, that I\u2019m terribly frightened? I\u2019ve been through this a hundred times to-day. Don\u2019t be any more angry than you can help. I was all right until I knew you were in town. If you\u2019d sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything! But you won\u2019t let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home.\u201d", "336": "Alexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and began to brush the sleeve of his jacket. \u201cIs this the way you mean to answer it, Hilda?\u201d he asked unsteadily.", "337": "She was afraid to look up at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t you mean even to say goodby to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to\u2014quit me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI came to tell you that I\u2019m willing to do as you asked me. But it\u2019s no use talking about that now. Give me my things, please.\u201d She put her hand out toward the fender.", "338": "Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair. \u201cDid you think I had forgotten you were in town, Hilda? Do you think I kept away by accident? Did you suppose I didn\u2019t know you were sailing on Tuesday? There is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer. It was to have reached you on the steamer. I was all the morning writing it. I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing. Marks on paper mean something to you.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey never did to me.\u201d", "339": "Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve. \u201cOh, Bartley! Did you write to me? Why didn\u2019t you telephone me to let me know that you had? Then I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d", "340": "Alexander slipped his arm about her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it before, Hilda, on my honor I didn\u2019t, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this. I\u2019ve watched that door all day. I\u2019ve jumped up if the fire crackled. I think I have felt that you were coming.\u201d He bent his face over her hair.", "341": "\u201cAnd I,\u201d she whispered,\u2014\u201cI felt that you were feeling that. But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken.\u201d", "342": "Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.", "343": "\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t mistaken. I\u2019ve been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed.\u201d He dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees. \u201cWhat am I to do, Hilda?\u201d", "344": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I\u2019m going to do what you asked me to do when you were in London. Only I\u2019ll do it more completely. I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d", "345": "\u201cWho?\u201d", "346": "\u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I\u2019m too fond of him.\u201d", "347": "Alexander moved restlessly. \u201cAre you joking, Hilda?\u201d", "348": "\u201cIndeed I\u2019m not.\u201d", "349": "\u201cThen you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "350": "\u201cYes, I know very well. I\u2019ve thought about it a great deal, and I\u2019ve quite decided. I never used to understand how women did things like that, but I know now. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t be at the mercy of the man they love any longer.\u201d", "351": "Alexander flushed angrily. \u201cSo it\u2019s better to be at the mercy of a man you don\u2019t love?\u201d", "352": "\u201cUnder such circumstances, infinitely!\u201d", "353": "There was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander\u2019s fall. He got up and went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out. He heard Hilda moving about behind him. When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots. He went back and stood over her.", "354": "\u201cHilda you\u2019d better think a while longer before you do that. I don\u2019t know what I ought to say, but I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be happy; truly I don\u2019t. Aren\u2019t you trying to frighten me?\u201d", "355": "She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly. \u201cNo; I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019ve made up my mind to do. I suppose I would better do it without telling you. But afterward I shan\u2019t have an opportunity to explain, for I shan\u2019t be seeing you again.\u201d", "356": "Alexander started to speak, but caught himself. When Hilda rose he sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.", "357": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so much alarmed if I didn\u2019t know how utterly reckless you CAN be. Don\u2019t do anything like that rashly.\u201d His face grew troubled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be happy. You are not that kind of woman. I\u2019d never have another hour\u2019s peace if I helped to make you do a thing like that.\u201d He took her face between his hands and looked down into it. \u201cYou see, you are different, Hilda. Don\u2019t you know you are?\u201d His voice grew softer, his touch more and more tender. \u201cSome women can do that sort of thing, but you\u2014you can love as queens did, in the old time.\u201d", "358": "Hilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before. She closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled. \u201cOnly one, Bartley. Only one. And he threw it back at me a second time.\u201d", "359": "She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.", "360": "\u201cTry him again, Hilda. Try him once again.\u201d", "361": "She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands.", "362": "On Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in Vermont, was standing on the siding at White River Junction when the Canadian Express pulled by on its northward journey. As the day-coaches at the rear end of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at one of the windows a man\u2019s head, with thick rumpled hair. \u201cCurious,\u201d he thought; \u201cthat looked like Alexander, but what would he be doing back there in the daycoaches?\u201d", "363": "It was, indeed, Alexander.", "364": "That morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that there was serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there at once, so he had caught the first train out of New York. He had taken a seat in a day-coach to avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and because he did not wish to be comfortable. When the telegram arrived, Alexander was at his rooms on Tenth Street, packing his bag to go to Boston. On Monday night he had written a long letter to his wife, but when morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter was still in his pocket. Winifred was not a woman who could bear disappointment. She demanded a great deal of herself and of the people she loved; and she never failed herself. If he told her now, he knew, it would be irretrievable. There would be no going back. He would lose the thing he valued most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own happiness. There would be nothing for him afterward. He seemed to see himself dragging out a restless existence on the Continent\u2014Cannes, Hyeres, Algiers, Cairo\u2014among smartly dressed, disabled men of every nationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to catch trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning with a great bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no purpose and no meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late to shorten the day.", "365": "And for what? For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he could not let go. AND HE COULD EVEN LET IT GO, he told himself. But he had promised to be in London at mid-summer, and he knew that he would go. . . . It was impossible to live like this any longer.", "366": "And this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had foreseen for him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust. And he could not understand how it had come about. He felt that he himself was unchanged, that he was still there, the same man he had been five years ago, and that he was sitting stupidly by and letting some resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life for him. This new force was not he, it was but a part of him. He would not even admit that it was stronger than he; but it was more active. It was by its energy that this new feeling got the better of him. His wife was the woman who had made his life, gratified his pride, given direction to his tastes and habits. The life they led together seemed to him beautiful. Winifred still was, as she had always been, Romance for him, and whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to her. When the grandeur and beauty of the world challenged him\u2014as it challenges even the most self-absorbed people\u2014he always answered with her name. That was his reply to the question put by the mountains and the stars; to all the spiritual aspects of life. In his feeling for his wife there was all the tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was capable. There was everything but energy; the energy of youth which must register itself and cut its name before it passes. This new feeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and light of foot. It ran and was not wearied, anticipated him everywhere. It put a girdle round the earth while he was going from New York to Moorlock. At this moment, it was tingling through him, exultant, and live as quicksilver, whispering, \u201cIn July you will be in England.\u201d", "367": "Already he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish coast, the sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train through the summer country. He closed his eyes and gave himself up to the feeling of rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts. He was sitting so, his face shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him from the siding at White River Junction.", "368": "When at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to sunset. The train was passing through a gray country and the sky overhead was flushed with a wide flood of clear color. There was a rose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows. Off to the left, under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a group of boys were sitting around a little fire. The smell of the wood smoke blew in at the window. Except for an old farmer, jogging along the highroad in his box-wagon, there was not another living creature to be seen. Alexander looked back wistfully at the boys, camped on the edge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and looking gravely at their fire. They took his mind back a long way, to a campfire on a sandbar in a Western river, and he wished he could go back and sit down with them. He could remember exactly how the world had looked then.", "369": "It was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it occurred to him that the train must be nearing Allway. In going to his new bridge at Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway. The train stopped at Allway Mills, then wound two miles up the river, and then the hollow sound under his feet told Bartley that he was on his first bridge again. The bridge seemed longer than it had ever seemed before, and he was glad when he felt the beat of the wheels on the solid roadbed again. He did not like coming and going across that bridge, or remembering the man who built it. And was he, indeed, the same man who used to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and to the stars? And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet hills sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge reaching out into the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big white house; upstairs, in Winifred\u2019s window, the light that told him she was still awake and still thinking of him. And after the light went out he walked alone, taking the heavens into his confidence, unable to tear himself away from the white magic of the night, unwilling to sleep because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time since first the hills were hung with moonlight, there was a lover in the world. And always there was the sound of the rushing water underneath, the sound which, more than anything else, meant death; the wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish. Then, in the exaltation of love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other thing as strong as love. Under the moon, under the cold, splendid stars, there were only those two things awake and sleepless; death and love, the rushing river and his burning heart.", "370": "Alexander sat up and looked about him. The train was tearing on through the darkness. All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or sleeping heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low. How came he here among all these dirty people? Why was he going to London? What did it mean\u2014what was the answer? How could this happen to a man who had lived through that magical spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars themselves were but flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of his love?", "371": "What had he done to lose it? How could he endure the baseness of life without it? And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the unquiet quicksilver in his breast told him that at midsummer he would be in London. He remembered his last night there: the red foggy darkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres, the hand-organs, the feverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the feeling of letting himself go with the crowd. He shuddered and looked about him at the poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and travel-stained, now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to stand to him for the ugliness he had brought into the world.", "372": "And those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he wished he could promise them better luck. Ah, if one could promise any one better luck, if one could assure a single human being of happiness! He had thought he could do so, once; and it was thinking of that that he at last fell asleep. In his sleep, as if it had nothing fresher to work upon, his mind went back and tortured itself with something years and years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his childhood.", "373": "When Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through pale golden ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating through the pine woods. The white birches, with their little unfolding leaves, gleamed in the lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already coming to life with their first green, a thin, bright color which had run over them like fire. As the train rushed along the trestles, thousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light. The sky was already a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal. Bartley caught up his bag and hurried through the Pullman coaches until he found the conductor. There was a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set about changing his clothes. Last night he would not have believed that anything could be so pleasant as the cold water he dashed over his head and shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on his body.", "374": "After he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into his lungs deep breaths of the pine-scented air. He had awakened with all his old sense of power. He could not believe that things were as bad with him as they had seemed last night, that there was no way to set them entirely right. Even if he went to London at midsummer, what would that mean except that he was a fool? And he had been a fool before. That was not the reality of his life. Yet he knew that he would go to London.", "375": "Half an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock. Alexander sprang to the platform and hurried up the siding, waving to Philip Horton, one of his assistants, who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the coaches. Bartley took his arm and they went together into the station buffet.", "376": "\u201cI\u2019ll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what seems to be the matter up here?\u201d", "377": "The young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation.", "378": "But Alexander cut him short. \u201cWhen did you stop work?\u201d he asked sharply.", "379": "The young engineer looked confused. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped work yet, Mr. Alexander. I didn\u2019t feel that I could go so far without definite authorization from you.\u201d", "380": "\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and ask for your authorization? You\u2019d have got it quick enough.\u201d", "381": "\u201cWell, really, Mr. Alexander, I couldn\u2019t be absolutely sure, you know, and I didn\u2019t like to take the responsibility of making it public.\u201d", "382": "Alexander pushed back his chair and rose. \u201cAnything I do can be made public, Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing strain, and that even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet you\u2019ve gone on adding weight.\u201d", "383": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here yesterday. My first telegram missed you somehow. I sent one Sunday evening, to the same address, but it was returned to me.\u201d", "384": "\u201cHave you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire.\u201d", "385": "Alexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following message to his wife:\u2014", "386": "I may have to be here for some time. Can you come up at once? Urgent.", "387": "BARTLEY.", "388": "The Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town. When they were seated in the carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant further. If it were true that the compression members showed strain, with the bridge only two thirds done, then there was nothing to do but pull the whole structure down and begin over again. Horton kept repeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong with the estimates.", "389": "Alexander grew impatient. \u201cThat\u2019s all true, Phil, but we never were justified in assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an ordinary bridge would work with anything of such length. It\u2019s all very well on paper, but it remains to be seen whether it can be done in practice. I should have thrown up the job when they crowded me. It\u2019s all nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing when you know they\u2019re not sound.\u201d", "390": "\u201cBut just now, when there is such competition,\u201d the younger man demurred. \u201cAnd certainly that\u2019s the new line of development.\u201d", "391": "Alexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.", "392": "When they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination immediately. An hour later he sent for the superintendent. \u201cI think you had better stop work out there at once, Dan. I should say that the lower chord here might buckle at any moment. I told the Commission that we were using higher unit stresses than any practice has established, and we\u2019ve put the dead load at a low estimate. Theoretically it worked out well enough, but it had never actually been tried.\u201d Alexander put on his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t look so chopfallen, Dan. It\u2019s a jolt, but we\u2019ve got to face it. It isn\u2019t the end of the world, you know. Now we\u2019ll go out and call the men off quietly. They\u2019re already nervous, Horton tells me, and there\u2019s no use alarming them. I\u2019ll go with you, and we\u2019ll send the end riveters in first.\u201d", "393": "Alexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the long span. They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was doing, as if they were on an ordinary round of inspection. When they reached the end of the river span, Alexander nodded to the superintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman. The men in the end gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each other, started back across the bridge toward the river-bank. Alexander himself remained standing where they had been working, looking about him. It was hard to believe, as he looked back over it, that the whole great span was incurably disabled, was already as good as condemned, because something was out of line in the lower chord of the cantilever arm.", "394": "The end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the tool-houses, and the second gang had picked up their tools and were starting toward the shore. Alexander, still standing at the end of the river span, saw the lower chord of the cantilever arm give a little, like an elbow bending. He shouted and ran after the second gang, but by this time every one knew that the big river span was slowly settling. There was a burst of shouting that was immediately drowned by the scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work began to pull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of tons of ironwork, all riveted together and lying in midair without support. It tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises that were like the shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of any kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own weight. It lurched neither to right nor left, but sank almost in a vertical line, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of the men jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore.", "395": "At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the downstream side of the bridge. He struck the water without injury and disappeared. He was under the river a long time and had great difficulty in holding his breath. When it seemed impossible, and his chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his wife telling him that he could hold out a little longer. An instant later his face cleared the water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had realized what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last abandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew he should live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at last, he felt sure of himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him that he had been through something of this sort before. There was nothing horrible about it. This, too, was life, and life was activity, just as it was in Boston or in London. He was himself, and there was something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural. Alexander was a strong swimmer, but he had gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the bridge itself, which had been settling faster and faster, crashed into the water behind him. Immediately the river was full of drowning men. A gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He thought he had cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching at him and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either hurt or crazed with fright. Alexander tried to beat them off, but there were too many of them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped him about the middle, and they went down together. When he sank, his wife seemed to be there in the water beside him, telling him to keep his head, that if he could hold out the men would drown and release him. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but he could not think clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered what it was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go.", "396": "The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following night. By the next morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the river, but there were still twenty missing. Many of the men had fallen with the bridge and were held down under the debris. Early on the morning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled and churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line two thirds across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and word soon spread among the crowds on the shore that its occupant was the wife of the Chief Engineer; his body had not yet been found. The widows of the lost workmen, moving up and down the bank with shawls over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked at the rusty hired hack many times that morning. They drew near it and walked about it, but none of them ventured to peer within. Even half-indifferent sightseers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: \u201cYou see that carriage over there? That\u2019s Mrs. Alexander. They haven\u2019t found him yet. She got off the train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in Boston yesterday\u2014heard the newsboys crying it in the street.\u201d", "397": "At noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a tin coffee-pot from the camp kitchen. When he reached the carriage he found Mrs. Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning, leaning forward a little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking at the river. Hour after hour she had been watching the water, the lonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed mass of iron wreckage over which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam.", "398": "\u201cThose poor women out there, do they blame him very much?\u201d she asked, as she handed the coffee-cup back to Horton.", "399": "\u201cNobody blames him, Mrs. Alexander. If any one is to blame, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s I. I should have stopped work before he came. He said so as soon as I met him. I tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram missed him, somehow. He didn\u2019t have time really to explain to me. If he\u2019d got here Monday, he\u2019d have had all the men off at once. But, you see, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never happened before. According to all human calculations, it simply couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "400": "Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not had his clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent excitement was beginning to wear off.", "401": "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don\u2019t leave me to the dread of finding out things that people may be saying. If he is blamed, if he needs any one to speak for him,\u201d\u2014for the first time her voice broke and a flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept over her rigid pallor,\u2014\u201cif he needs any one, tell me, show me what to do.\u201d She began to sob, and Horton hurried away.", "402": "When he came back at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon he was carrying his hat in his hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had found Bartley. She opened the carriage door before he reached her and stepped to the ground.", "403": "Horton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly: \u201cWon\u2019t you drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up there.\u201d", "404": "\u201cTake me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble.\u201d", "405": "The group of men down under the riverbank fell back when they saw a woman coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher. They took off their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although she had pulled her veil down over her face they did not look up at her. She was taller than Horton, and some of the men thought she was the tallest woman they had ever seen. \u201cAs tall as himself,\u201d some one whispered. Horton motioned to the men, and six of them lifted the stretcher and began to carry it up the embankment. Winifred followed them the half-mile to Horton\u2019s house. She walked quietly, without once breaking or stumbling. When the bearers put the stretcher down in Horton\u2019s spare bedroom, she thanked them and gave her hand to each in turn. The men went out of the house and through the yard with their caps in their hands. They were too much confused to say anything as they went down the hill.", "406": "Horton himself was almost as deeply perplexed. \u201cMamie,\u201d he said to his wife, when he came out of the spare room half an hour later, \u201cwill you take Mrs. Alexander the things she needs? She is going to do everything herself. Just stay about where you can hear her and go in if she wants you.\u201d", "407": "Everything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of prescience under the river. With her own hands she washed him clean of every mark of disaster. All night he was alone with her in the still house, his great head lying deep in the pillow. In the pocket of his coat Winifred found the letter that he had written her the night before he left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but because of its length, she knew it had been meant for her.", "408": "For Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled upon him consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end. His harshest critics did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have retrieved himself. Even Lucius Wilson did not see in this accident the disaster he had once foretold.", "409": "When a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say whether he did well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to be. The mind that society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable machine, dedicated to its service, may for a long time have been sick within itself and bent upon its own destruction.", "410": "Professor Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was just back from a visit to America. One afternoon, soon after his return, he put on his frock-coat and drove in a hansom to pay a call upon Hilda Burgoyne, who still lived at her old number, off Bedford Square. He and Miss Burgoyne had been fast friends for a long time. He had first noticed her about the corridors of the British Museum, where he read constantly. Her being there so often had made him feel that he would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible person, an introduction was not difficult. The preliminaries once over, they came to depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day\u2019s reading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea. They had much more in common than their memories of a common friend. Indeed, they seldom spoke of him. They saved that for the deep moments which do not come often, and then their talk of him was mostly silence. Wilson knew that Hilda had loved him; more than this he had not tried to know.", "411": "It was late when Wilson reached Hilda\u2019s apartment on this particular December afternoon, and he found her alone. She sent for fresh tea and made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people comfortable.", "412": "\u201cHow good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays without you. You\u2019ve helped me over a good many Christmases.\u201d She smiled at him gayly.", "413": "\u201cAs if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed YOU. How well you are looking, my dear, and how rested.\u201d", "414": "He peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long fingers together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with years.", "415": "Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. \u201cThat means that I was looking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn\u2019t it? Well, we must show wear at last, you know.\u201d", "416": "Wilson took the cup gratefully. \u201cAh, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries. I was most gently treated\u2014as a sort of precious relic. But, do you know, it made me feel awkward to be hanging about still.\u201d", "417": "\u201cSeventy? Never mention it to me.\u201d Hilda looked appreciatively at the Professor\u2019s alert face, with so many kindly lines about the mouth and so many quizzical ones about the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hang about for me, you know. I can\u2019t even let you go home again. You must stay put, now that I have you back. You\u2019re the realest thing I have.\u201d", "418": "Wilson chuckled. \u201cDear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the spoils of conquered cities! You\u2019ve really missed me? Well, then, I shall hang. Even if you have at last to put ME in the mummy-room with the others. You\u2019ll visit me often, won\u2019t you?\u201d", "419": "\u201cEvery day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer, where you left them.\u201d She struck a match and lit one for him. \u201cBut you did, after all, enjoy being at home again?\u201d", "420": "\u201cOh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a thousand miles apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the place. It was in Boston I lingered longest.\u201d", "421": "\u201cAh, you saw Mrs. Alexander?\u201d", "422": "\u201cOften. I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I should think. Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on. I found that I still loved to go to the house. It always seemed as if Bartley were there, somehow, and that at any moment one might hear his heavy tramp on the stairs. Do you know, I kept feeling that he must be up in his study.\u201d The Professor looked reflectively into the grate. \u201cI should really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last long talk with him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it.\u201d", "423": "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "424": "Wilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so quickly that his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and pulled them awry. \u201cWhy? Why, dear me, I don\u2019t know. She probably never thought of it.\u201d", "425": "Hilda bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what made me say that. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Go on please, and tell me how it was.\u201d", "426": "\u201cWell, it was like that. Almost as if he were there. In a way, he really is there. She never lets him go. It\u2019s the most beautiful and dignified sorrow I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s so beautiful that it has its compensations, I should think. Its very completeness is a compensation. It gives her a fixed star to steer by. She doesn\u2019t drift. We sat there evening after evening in the quiet of that magically haunted room, and watched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him. Felt him with a difference, of course.\u201d", "427": "Hilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand. \u201cWith a difference? Because of her, you mean?\u201d", "428": "Wilson\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cSomething like that, yes. Of course, as time goes on, to her he becomes more and more their simple personal relation.\u201d", "429": "Hilda studied the droop of the Professor\u2019s head intently. \u201cYou didn\u2019t altogether like that? You felt it wasn\u2019t wholly fair to him?\u201d", "430": "Wilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses. \u201cOh, fair enough. More than fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a little different from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold absolutely all of a person. And I liked him just as he was; his deviations, too; the places where he didn\u2019t square.\u201d", "431": "Hilda considered vaguely. \u201cHas she grown much older?\u201d she asked at last.", "432": "\u201cYes, and no. In a tragic way she is even handsomer. But colder. Cold for everything but him. `Forget thyself to marble\u2019; I kept thinking of that. Her happiness was a happiness a deux, not apart from the world, but actually against it. And now her grief is like that. She saves herself for it and doesn\u2019t even go through the form of seeing people much. I\u2019m sorry. It would be better for her, and might be so good for them, if she could let other people in.\u201d", "433": "\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with somebody.\u201d", "434": "Wilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm. \u201cDear me, it takes a woman to think of that, now! I don\u2019t, you know, think we ought to be hard on her. More, even, than the rest of us she didn\u2019t choose her destiny. She underwent it. And it has left her chilled. As to her not wishing to take the world into her confidence\u2014well, it is a pretty brutal and stupid world, after all, you know.\u201d", "435": "Hilda leaned forward. \u201cYes, I know, I know. Only I can\u2019t help being glad that there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people. My little Marie worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when she has come to his picture.\u201d", "436": "Wilson nodded. \u201cOh, yes! He left an echo. The ripples go on in all of us. He belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are only onlookers at the best. We shouldn\u2019t wonder too much at Mrs. Alexander. She must feel how useless it would be to stir about, that she may as well sit still; that nothing can happen to her after Bartley.\u201d", "437": "\u201cYes,\u201d said Hilda softly, \u201cnothing can happen to one after Bartley.\u201d", "438": "They both sat looking into the fire."}}}, {"title": "The Prisoner of Zenda", "author": "Hope, Anthony, 1863-1933", "edition": null, "pub_info": null, "form": null, "segments": {"CHAPTER TITLES": {"0": "\u201cI wonder when in the world you\u2019re going to do anything, Rudolf?\u201d said my brother\u2019s wife.", "1": "\u201cMy dear Rose,\u201d I answered, laying down my egg-spoon, \u201cwhy in the world should I do anything?

And, by way of closing the discussion\u2014and also, I must admit, of exasperating my strict little sister-in-law a trifle more\u2014I observed:", "24": "\u201cI rather like being an Elphberg myself.\u201d", "25": "When I read a story, I skip the explanations; yet the moment I begin to write one, I find that I must have an explanation. For it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg. For eminent as, I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House. For what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.?", "26": "Well then\u2014and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten\u2014in the year 1733, George II. sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania. The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair\u2014in fact, the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind. He stayed some months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in the end, he left rather under a cloud. For he fought a duel (it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank) with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife. In that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him a pretty handful. The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife\u2014who, after another two months, bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon. This lady was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter. As for Rudolf, he went back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour\u2014with one short interval. And, finally, if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner.", "27": "That is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the lines of the \u201cPeerages\u201d.", "28": "It will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led. Well, be that as it may, I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge. I had been to a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by. I was, I believe, a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot. I could ride anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you could find, for all its flaming cover. If you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition.", "29": "\u201cThe difference between you and Robert,\u201d said my sister-in-law, who often (bless her!) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she were on one, \u201cis that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you see the opportunities of yours.\u201d", "30": "\u201cTo a man of spirit, my dear Rose,\u201d I answered, \u201copportunities are duties.\u201d", "31": "\u201cNonsense!\u201d said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on: \u201cNow, here\u2019s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to.\u201d", "32": "\u201cA thousand thanks!\u201d I murmured.", "33": "\u201cHe\u2019s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that he\u2019ll take you as an attache. Do take it, Rudolf\u2014to please me.\u201d", "34": "Now, when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way, wrinkling her pretty brows, twisting her little hands, and growing wistful in the eyes, all on account of an idle scamp like myself, for whom she has no natural responsibility, I am visited with compunction. Moreover, I thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested with some tolerable amusement. Therefore I said:", "35": "\u201cMy dear sister, if in six months\u2019 time no unforeseen obstacle has arisen, and Sir Jacob invites me, hang me if I don\u2019t go with Sir Jacob!\u201d", "36": "\u201cOh, Rudolf, how good of you! I am glad!\u201d", "37": "\u201cWhere\u2019s he going to?\u201d", "38": "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet; but it\u2019s sure to be a good Embassy.\u201d", "39": "\u201cMadame,\u201d said I, \u201cfor your sake I\u2019ll go, if it\u2019s no more than a beggarly Legation. When I do a thing, I don\u2019t do it by halves.\u201d", "40": "My promise, then, was given; but six months are six months, and seem an eternity, and, inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective industry (I suppose attaches are industrious; but I know not, for I never became attache to Sir Jacob or anybody else), I cast about for some desirable mode of spending them. And it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and, since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country. But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which had played no small part in European history, and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in The Times that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion. At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol\u2014an old haunt of mine\u2014and propitiated Rose\u2019s wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.", "41": "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I hinted darkly, \u201cthere may be an outcome of the expedition.\u201d", "42": "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.", "43": "\u201cWell,\u201d said I carelessly, \u201cthere seems a gap that might be filled by an exhaustive work on\u2014\u201d", "44": "\u201cOh! will you write a book?\u201d she cried, clapping her hands. \u201cThat would be splendid, wouldn\u2019t it, Robert?\u201d", "45": "\u201cIt\u2019s the best of introductions to political life nowadays,\u201d observed my brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several times over. Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts and The Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student, are both works of recognized eminence.", "46": "\u201cI believe you are right, Bob, my boy,\u201d said I.", "47": "\u201cNow promise you\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Rose earnestly.", "48": "\u201cNo, I won\u2019t promise; but if I find enough material, I will.\u201d", "49": "\u201cThat\u2019s fair enough,\u201d said Robert.", "50": "\u201cOh, material doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d she said, pouting.", "51": "But this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me. To tell the truth, I would have wagered a handsome sum that the story of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single pen. And that shows how little we know what the future holds; for here I am, fulfilling my qualified promise, and writing, as I never thought to write, a book\u2014though it will hardly serve as an introduction to political life, and has not a jot to do with the Tyrol.", "52": "Neither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it to her critical eye\u2014a step which I have no intention of taking.", "53": "It was a maxim of my Uncle William\u2019s that no man should pass through Paris without spending four-and-twenty hours there. My uncle spoke out of a ripe experience of the world, and I honoured his advice by putting up for a day and a night at \u201cThe Continental\u201d on my way to\u2014the Tyrol. I called on George Featherly at the Embassy, and we had a bit of dinner together at Durand\u2019s, and afterwards dropped in to the Opera; and after that we had a little supper, and after that we called on Bertram Bertrand, a versifier of some repute and Paris correspondent to The Critic. He had a very comfortable suite of rooms, and we found some pleasant fellows smoking and talking. It struck me, however, that Bertram himself was absent and in low spirits, and when everybody except ourselves had gone, I rallied him on his moping preoccupation. He fenced with me for a while, but at last, flinging himself on a sofa, he exclaimed:", "54": "\u201cVery well; have it your own way. I am in love\u2014infernally in love!\u201d", "55": "\u201cOh, you\u2019ll write the better poetry,\u201d said I, by way of consolation.", "56": "He ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously. George Featherly, standing with his back to the mantelpiece, smiled unkindly.", "57": "\u201cIf it\u2019s the old affair,\u201d said he, \u201cyou may as well throw it up, Bert. She\u2019s leaving Paris tomorrow.\u201d", "58": "\u201cI know that,\u201d snapped Bertram.", "59": "\u201cNot that it would make any difference if she stayed,\u201d pursued the relentless George. \u201cShe flies higher than the paper trade, my boy!\u201d", "60": "\u201cHang her!\u201d said Bertram.", "61": "\u201cIt would make it more interesting for me,\u201d I ventured to observe, \u201cif I knew who you were talking about.\u201d", "62": "\u201cAntoinette Mauban,\u201d said George.", "63": "\u201cDe Mauban,\u201d growled Bertram.", "64": "\u201cOho!\u201d said I, passing by the question of the `de\u2019. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say, Bert\u2014?\u201d", "65": "\u201cCan\u2019t you let me alone?\u201d", "66": "\u201cWhere\u2019s she going to?\u201d I asked, for the lady was something of a celebrity.", "67": "George jingled his money, smiled cruelly at poor Bertram, and answered pleasantly:", "68": "\u201cNobody knows. By the way, Bert, I met a great man at her house the other night\u2014at least, about a month ago. Did you ever meet him\u2014the Duke of Strelsau?\u201d", "69": "\u201cYes, I did,\u201d growled Bertram.", "70": "\u201cAn extremely accomplished man, I thought him.\u201d", "71": "It was not hard to see that George\u2019s references to the duke were intended to aggravate poor Bertram\u2019s sufferings, so that I drew the inference that the duke had distinguished Madame de Mauban by his attentions. She was a widow, rich, handsome, and, according to repute, ambitious. It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the new King. He had been his father\u2019s favourite, and it had occasioned some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title derived from no less a city than the capital itself. His mother had been of good, but not exalted, birth.", "72": "\u201cHe\u2019s not in Paris now, is he?\u201d I asked.", "73": "\u201cOh no! He\u2019s gone back to be present at the King\u2019s coronation; a ceremony which, I should say, he\u2019ll not enjoy much. But, Bert, old man, don\u2019t despair! He won\u2019t marry the fair Antoinette\u2014at least, not unless another plan comes to nothing. Still perhaps she\u2014\u201d He paused and added, with a laugh: \u201cRoyal attentions are hard to resist\u2014you know that, don\u2019t you, Rudolf?\u201d", "74": "\u201cConfound you!\u201d said I; and rising, I left the hapless Bertram in George\u2019s hands and went home to bed.", "75": "The next day George Featherly went with me to the station, where I took a ticket for Dresden.", "76": "\u201cGoing to see the pictures?\u201d asked George, with a grin.", "77": "George is an inveterate gossip, and had I told him that I was off to Ruritania, the news would have been in London in three days and in Park Lane in a week. I was, therefore, about to return an evasive answer, when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across the platform. Following him with my eyes, I saw him lift his hat and accost a graceful, fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from the booking-office. She was, perhaps, a year or two over thirty, tall, dark, and of rather full figure. As George talked, I saw her glance at me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from my best. A moment later, George rejoined me.", "78": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a charming travelling companion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s poor Bert Bertrand\u2019s goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, she\u2019s going to Dresden\u2014also, no doubt, to see the pictures. It\u2019s very queer, though, that she doesn\u2019t at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.\u201d", "79": "\u201cI didn\u2019t ask to be introduced,\u201d I observed, a little annoyed.", "80": "\u201cWell, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, \u2018Another time.\u2019 Never mind, old fellow, perhaps there\u2019ll be a smash, and you\u2019ll have a chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau!\u201d", "81": "No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban. I can speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a night\u2019s rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train. Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully, but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I could do so unobserved.", "82": "As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and found in them news which affected my movements. For some reason, which was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was to take place on the next day but one. The whole country seemed in a stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged. Rooms were all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant charge for it. I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier. My train reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda.", "83": "Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train passed where I stood on the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could boast, secured apartments there. I smiled to think how surprised George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow travellers for so long.", "84": "I was very kindly received at the hotel\u2014it was really no more than an inn\u2014kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters. They were good, quiet people, and seemed very little interested in the great doings at Strelsau. The old lady\u2019s hero was the duke, for he was now, under the late King\u2019s will, master of the Zenda estates and of the Castle, which rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so from the inn. The old lady, indeed, did not hesitate to express regret that the duke was not on the throne, instead of his brother.", "85": "\u201cWe know Duke Michael,\u201d said she. \u201cHe has always lived among us; every Ruritanian knows Duke Michael.

He begged therefore that, if such humble (though, as he added, clean and comfortable) lodgings would satisfy me, I would take his place. He pledged his sister\u2019s acquiescence, and urged the inconvenience and crowding to which I should be subject in my journeys to and from Strelsau the next day. I accepted his offer without a moment\u2019s hesitation, and he went off to telegraph to his sister, while I packed up and prepared to take the next train. But I still hankered after the forest and the hunting-lodge, and when my little maid told me that I could, by walking ten miles or so through the forest, hit the railway at a roadside station, I decided to send my luggage direct to the address which Johann had given, take my walk, and follow to Strelsau myself. Johann had gone off and was not aware of the change in my plans; but, as its only effect was to delay my arrival at his sister\u2019s for a few hours, there was no reason for troubling to inform him of it. Doubtless the good lady would waste no anxiety on my account.", "138": "I took an early luncheon, and, having bidden my kind entertainers farewell, promising to return to them on my way home, I set out to climb the hill that led to the Castle, and thence to the forest of Zenda. Half an hour\u2019s leisurely walking brought me to the Castle. It had been a fortress in old days, and the ancient keep was still in good preservation and very imposing. Behind it stood another portion of the original castle, and behind that again, and separated from it by a deep and broad moat, which ran all round the old buildings, was a handsome modern chateau, erected by the last king, and now forming the country residence of the Duke of Strelsau. The old and the new portions were connected by a drawbridge, and this indirect mode of access formed the only passage between the old building and the outer world; but leading to the modern chateau there was a broad and handsome avenue. It was an ideal residence: when \u201cBlack Michael\u201d desired company, he could dwell in his chateau; if a fit of misanthropy seized him, he had merely to cross the bridge and draw it up after him (it ran on rollers), and nothing short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out. I went on my way, glad that poor Black Michael, though he could not have the throne or the princess, had, at least, as fine a residence as any prince in Europe.", "139": "Soon I entered the forest, and walked on for an hour or more in its cool sombre shade. The great trees enlaced with one another over my head, and the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds, and hardly bigger. I was enchanted with the place, and, finding a felled tree-trunk, propped my back against it, and stretching my legs out gave myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods and to the comfort of a good cigar. And when the cigar was finished and I had (I suppose) inhaled as much beauty as I could, I went off into the most delightful sleep, regardless of my train to Strelsau and of the fast-waning afternoon. To remember a train in such a spot would have been rank sacrilege. Instead of that, I fell to dreaming that I was married to the Princess Flavia and dwelt in the Castle of Zenda, and beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest\u2014which made a very pleasant dream. In fact, I was just impressing a fervent kiss on the charming lips of the princess, when I heard (and the voice seemed at first a part of the dream) someone exclaim, in rough strident tones.", "140": "\u201cWhy, the devil\u2019s in it! Shave him, and he\u2019d be the King!\u201d", "141": "The idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream: by the sacrifice of my heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial, I was to be transformed into a monarch! I was about to kiss the princess again, when I arrived (very reluctantly) at the conclusion that I was awake.", "142": "I opened my eyes, and found two men regarding me with much curiosity. Both wore shooting costumes and carried guns. One was rather short and very stoutly built, with a big bullet-shaped head, a bristly grey moustache, and small pale-blue eyes, a trifle bloodshot. The other was a slender young fellow, of middle height, dark in complexion, and bearing himself with grace and distinction. I set the one down as an old soldier: the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society, but not unused to military life either. It turned out afterwards that my guess was a good one.", "143": "The elder man approached me, beckoning the younger to follow. He did so, courteously raising his hat. I rose slowly to my feet.", "144": "\u201cHe\u2019s the height, too!\u201d I heard the elder murmur, as he surveyed my six feet two inches of stature. Then, with a cavalier touch of the cap, he addressed me:", "145": "\u201cMay I ask your name?\u201d", "146": "\u201cAs you have taken the first step in the acquaintance, gentlemen,\u201d said I, with a smile, \u201csuppose you give me a lead in the matter of names.\u201d", "147": "The young man stepped forward with a pleasant smile.", "148": "\u201cThis,\u201d said he, \u201cis Colonel Sapt, and I am called Fritz von Tarlenheim: we are both in the service of the King of Ruritania.\u201d", "149": "I bowed and, baring my head, answered:", "150": "\u201cI am Rudolf Rassendyll. I am a traveller from England; and once for a year or two I held a commission from her Majesty the Queen.\u201d", "151": "\u201cThen we are all brethren of the sword,\u201d answered Tarlenheim, holding out his hand, which I took readily.", "152": "\u201cRassendyll, Rassendyll!\u201d muttered Colonel Sapt; then a gleam of intelligence flitted across his face.", "153": "\u201cBy Heaven!\u201d he cried, \u201cyou\u2019re of the Burlesdons?\u201d", "154": "\u201cMy brother is now Lord Burlesdon,\u201d said I.", "155": "\u201cThy head betrayeth thee,\u201d he chuckled, pointing to my uncovered poll. \u201cWhy, Fritz, you know the story?\u201d", "156": "The young man glanced apologetically at me. He felt a delicacy which my sister-in-law would have admired. To put him at his ease, I remarked with a smile:", "157": "\u201cAh! the story is known here as well as among us, it seems.\u201d", "158": "\u201cKnown!\u201d cried Sapt. \u201cIf you stay here, the deuce a man in all Ruritania will doubt of it\u2014or a woman either.\u201d", "159": "I began to feel uncomfortable. Had I realized what a very plainly written pedigree I carried about with me, I should have thought long before I visited Ruritania. However, I was in for it now.", "160": "At this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us:", "161": "\u201cFritz, Fritz! where are you, man?\u201d", "162": "Tarlenheim started, and said hastily:", "163": "\u201cIt\u2019s the King!\u201d", "164": "Old Sapt chuckled again.", "165": "Then a young man jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood beside us. As I looked at him, I uttered an astonished cry; and he, seeing me, drew back in sudden wonder. Saving the hair on my face and a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him, saving also that he lacked perhaps half an inch\u2014nay, less than that, but still something\u2014of my height, the King of Ruritania might have been Rudolf Rassendyll, and I, Rudolf, the King.", "166": "For an instant we stood motionless, looking at one another. Then I bared my head again and bowed respectfully. The King found his voice, and asked in bewilderment:", "167": "\u201cColonel\u2014Fritz\u2014who is this gentleman?\u201d", "168": "I was about to answer, when Colonel Sapt stepped between the King and me, and began to talk to his Majesty in a low growl. The King towered over Sapt, and, as he listened, his eyes now and again sought mine. I looked at him long and carefully. The likeness was certainly astonishing, though I saw the points of difference also. The King\u2019s face was slightly more fleshy than mine, the oval of its contour the least trifle more pronounced, and, as I fancied, his mouth lacking something of the firmness (or obstinacy) which was to be gathered from my close-shutting lips. But, for all that, and above all minor distinctions, the likeness rose striking, salient, wonderful.", "169": "Sapt ceased speaking, and the King still frowned. Then, gradually, the corners of his mouth began to twitch, his nose came down (as mine does when I laugh), his eyes twinkled, and, behold! he burst into the merriest fit of irrepressible laughter, which rang through the woods and proclaimed him a jovial soul.", "170": "\u201cWell met, cousin!\u201d he cried, stepping up to me, clapping me on the back, and laughing still. \u201cYou must forgive me if I was taken aback. A man doesn\u2019t expect to see double at this time of day, eh, Fritz?\u201d", "171": "\u201cI must pray pardon, sire, for my presumption,\u201d said I. \u201cI trust it will not forfeit your Majesty\u2019s favour.\u201d", "172": "\u201cBy Heaven! you\u2019ll always enjoy the King\u2019s countenance,\u201d he laughed, \u201cwhether I like it or not; and, sir, I shall very gladly add to it what services I can. Where are you travelling to?\u201d", "173": "\u201cTo Strelsau, sire\u2014to the coronation.\u201d", "174": "The King looked at his friends: he still smiled, though his expression hinted some uneasiness. But the humorous side of the matter caught him again.", "175": "\u201cFritz, Fritz!\u201d he cried, \u201ca thousand crowns for a sight of brother Michael\u2019s face when he sees a pair of us!\u201d and the merry laugh rang out again.", "176": "\u201cSeriously,\u201d observed Fritz von Tarlenheim, \u201cI question Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s wisdom in visiting Strelsau just now.\u201d", "177": "The King lit a cigarette.", "178": "\u201cWell, Sapt?\u201d said he, questioningly.", "179": "\u201cHe mustn\u2019t go,\u201d growled the old fellow.", "180": "\u201cCome, colonel, you mean that I should be in Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s debt, if\u2014\u201d", "181": "\u201cOh, ay! wrap it up in the right way,\u201d said Sapt, hauling a great pipe out of his pocket.", "182": "\u201cEnough, sire,\u201d said I. \u201cI\u2019ll leave Ruritania today.\u201d", "183": "\u201cNo, by thunder, you shan\u2019t\u2014and that\u2019s sans phrase, as Sapt likes it. For you shall dine with me tonight, happen what will afterwards. Come, man, you don\u2019t meet a new relation every day!\u201d", "184": "\u201cWe dine sparingly tonight,\u201d said Fritz von Tarlenheim.", "185": "\u201cNot we\u2014with our new cousin for a guest!\u201d cried the King; and, as Fritz shrugged his shoulders, he added: \u201cOh! I\u2019ll remember our early start, Fritz.\u201d", "186": "\u201cSo will I\u2014tomorrow morning,\u201d said old Sapt, pulling at his pipe.", "187": "\u201cO wise old Sapt!\u201d cried the King. \u201cCome, Mr. Rassendyll\u2014by the way, what name did they give you?\u201d", "188": "\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s,\u201d I answered, bowing.", "189": "\u201cWell, that shows they weren\u2019t ashamed of us,\u201d he laughed. \u201cCome, then, cousin Rudolf; I\u2019ve got no house of my own here, but my dear brother Michael lends us a place of his, and we\u2019ll make shift to entertain you there;\u201d and he put his arm through mine and, signing to the others to accompany us, walked me off, westerly, through the forest.", "190": "We walked for more than half an hour, and the King smoked cigarettes and chattered incessantly. He was full of interest in my family, laughed heartily when I told him of the portraits with Elphberg hair in our galleries, and yet more heartily when he heard that my expedition to Ruritania was a secret one.", "191": "\u201cYou have to visit your disreputable cousin on the sly, have you?\u201d said he.", "192": "Suddenly emerging from the wood, we came on a small and rude hunting-lodge. It was a one-storey building, a sort of bungalow, built entirely of wood. As we approached it, a little man in a plain livery came out to meet us. The only other person I saw about the place was a fat elderly woman, whom I afterwards discovered to be the mother of Johann, the duke\u2019s keeper.", "193": "\u201cWell, is dinner ready, Josef?\u201d asked the King.", "194": "The little servant informed us that it was, and we soon sat down to a plentiful meal. The fare was plain enough: the King ate heartily, Fritz von Tarlenheim delicately, old Sapt voraciously. I played a good knife and fork, as my custom is; the King noticed my performance with approval.", "195": "\u201cWe\u2019re all good trenchermen, we Elphbergs,\u201d said he. \u201cBut what?\u2014we\u2019re eating dry!

Are we cattle, Josef?\u201d", "196": "At this reproof Josef hastened to load the table with bottles.", "197": "\u201cRemember tomorrow!\u201d said Fritz.", "198": "\u201cAy\u2014tomorrow!\u201d said old Sapt.", "199": "The King drained a bumper to his \u201cCousin Rudolf,\u201d as he was gracious\u2014or merry\u2014enough to call me; and I drank its fellow to the \u201cElphberg Red,\u201d whereat he laughed loudly.", "200": "Now, be the meat what it might, the wine we drank was beyond all price or praise, and we did it justice. Fritz ventured once to stay the King\u2019s hand.", "201": "\u201cWhat?\u201d cried the King. \u201cRemember you start before I do, Master Fritz\u2014you must be more sparing by two hours than I.\u201d", "202": "Fritz saw that I did not understand.", "203": "\u201cThe colonel and I,\u201d he explained, \u201cleave here at six: we ride down to Zenda and return with the guard of honour to fetch the King at eight, and then we all ride together to the station.\u201d", "204": "\u201cHang that same guard!\u201d growled Sapt.", "205": "\u201cOh! it\u2019s very civil of my brother to ask the honour for his regiment,\u201d said the King. \u201cCome, cousin, you need not start early. Another bottle, man!\u201d", "206": "I had another bottle\u2014or, rather, a part of one, for the larger half travelled quickly down his Majesty\u2019s throat. Fritz gave up his attempts at persuasion: from persuading, he fell to being persuaded, and soon we were all of us as full of wine as we had any right to be. The King began talking of what he would do in the future, old Sapt of what he had done in the past, Fritz of some beautiful girl or other, and I of the wonderful merits of the Elphberg dynasty. We all talked at once, and followed to the letter Sapt\u2019s exhortation to let the morrow take care of itself.", "207": "At last the King set down his glass and leant back in his chair.", "208": "\u201cI have drunk enough,\u201d said he.", "209": "\u201cFar be it from me to contradict the King,\u201d said I.", "210": "Indeed, his remark was most absolutely true\u2014so far as it went.", "211": "While I yet spoke, Josef came and set before the King a marvellous old wicker-covered flagon.

Hang him! Did he think I\u2019d flinch from his bottle?\u201d", "214": "The bottle was opened, and Josef filled the King\u2019s glass. The King tasted it.

But ask me not for a single drop of this divine bottle, which I will drink to the health of that\u2014that sly knave, my brother, Black Michael.\u201d", "216": "And the King seized the bottle and turned it over his mouth, and drained it and flung it from him, and laid his head on his arms on the table.", "217": "And we drank pleasant dreams to his Majesty\u2014and that is all I remember of the evening. Perhaps it is enough.", "218": "Whether I had slept a minute or a year I knew not. I awoke with a start and a shiver; my face, hair and clothes dripped water, and opposite me stood old Sapt, a sneering smile on his face and an empty bucket in his hand. On the table by him sat Fritz von Tarlenheim, pale as a ghost and black as a crow under the eyes.", "219": "I leapt to my feet in anger.", "220": "\u201cYour joke goes too far, sir!\u201d I cried.", "221": "\u201cTut, man, we\u2019ve no time for quarrelling.

And when Fritz saw me thus he drew a long breath and exclaimed:\u2014", "287": "\u201cBy Jove, we shall do it!\u201d", "288": "It was six o\u2019clock now, and we had no time to lose. Sapt hurried me into the King\u2019s room, and I dressed myself in the uniform of a colonel of the Guard, finding time as I slipped on the King\u2019s boots to ask Sapt what he had done with the old woman.", "289": "\u201cShe swore she\u2019d heard nothing,\u201d said he; \u201cbut to make sure I tied her legs together and put a handkerchief in her mouth and bound her hands, and locked her up in the coal-cellar, next door to the King. Josef will look after them both later on.\u201d", "290": "Then I burst out laughing, and even old Sapt grimly smiled.", "291": "\u201cI fancy,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when Josef tells them the King is gone they\u2019ll think it is because we smelt a rat. For you may swear Black Michael doesn\u2019t expect to see him in Strelsau today.\u201d", "292": "I put the King\u2019s helmet on my head. Old Sapt handed me the King\u2019s sword, looking at me long and carefully.", "293": "\u201cThank God, he shaved his beard!\u201d he exclaimed.", "294": "\u201cWhy did he?\u201d I asked.", "295": "\u201cBecause Princess Flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously pleased to give her a cousinly kiss. Come though, we must ride.\u201d", "296": "\u201cIs all safe here?\u201d", "297": "\u201cNothing\u2019s safe anywhere,\u201d said Sapt, \u201cbut we can make it no safer.\u201d", "298": "Fritz now rejoined us in the uniform of a captain in the same regiment as that to which my dress belonged. In four minutes Sapt had arrayed himself in his uniform. Josef called that the horses were ready. We jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot. The game had begun. What would the issue of it be?", "299": "The cool morning air cleared my head, and I was able to take in all Sapt said to me. He was wonderful. Fritz hardly spoke, riding like a man asleep, but Sapt, without another word for the King, began at once to instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life, of my family, of my tastes, pursuits, weaknesses, friends, companions, and servants. He told me the etiquette of the Ruritanian Court, promising to be constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom I ought to know, and give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them.", "300": "\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re a Catholic, I suppose?\u201d", "301": "\u201cNot I,\u201d I answered.", "302": "\u201cLord, he\u2019s a heretic!\u201d groaned Sapt, and forthwith he fell to a rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the Romish faith.", "303": "\u201cLuckily,\u201d said he, \u201cyou won\u2019t be expected to know much, for the King\u2019s notoriously lax and careless about such matters. But you must be as civil as butter to the Cardinal. We hope to win him over, because he and Michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence.\u201d", "304": "We were by now at the station. Fritz had recovered nerve enough to explain to the astonished station master that the King had changed his plans. The train steamed up. We got into a first-class carriage, and Sapt, leaning back on the cushions, went on with his lesson. I looked at my watch\u2014the King\u2019s watch it was, of course. It was just eight.", "305": "\u201cI wonder if they\u2019ve gone to look for us,\u201d I said.", "306": "\u201cI hope they won\u2019t find the King,\u201d said Fritz nervously, and this time it was Sapt who shrugged his shoulders.", "307": "The train travelled well, and at half-past nine, looking out of the window, I saw the towers and spires of a great city.", "308": "\u201cYour capital, my liege,\u201d grinned old Sapt, with a wave of his hand, and, leaning forward, he laid his finger on my pulse. \u201cA little too quick,\u201d said he, in his grumbling tone.", "309": "\u201cI\u2019m not made of stone!\u201d I exclaimed.", "310": "\u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d said he, with a nod. \u201cWe must say Fritz here has caught the ague. Drain your flask, Fritz, for heaven\u2019s sake, boy!\u201d", "311": "Fritz did as he was bid.", "312": "\u201cWe\u2019re an hour early,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cWe\u2019ll send word forward for your Majesty\u2019s arrival, for there\u2019ll be no one here to meet us yet. And meanwhile\u2014\u201d", "313": "\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said I, \u201cthe King\u2019ll be hanged if he doesn\u2019t have some breakfast.\u201d", "314": "Old Sapt chuckled, and held out his hand.", "315": "\u201cYou\u2019re an Elphberg, every inch of you,\u201d said he. Then he paused, and looking at us, said quietly, \u201cGod send we may be alive tonight!\u201d", "316": "\u201cAmen!\u201d said Fritz von Tarlenheim.", "317": "The train stopped. Fritz and Sapt leapt out, uncovered, and held the door for me. I choked down a lump that rose in my throat, settled my helmet firmly on my head, and (I\u2019m not ashamed to say it) breathed a short prayer to God. Then I stepped on the platform of the station at Strelsau.", "318": "A moment later, all was bustle and confusion: men hurrying up, hats in hand, and hurrying off again; men conducting me to the buffet; men mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops, to the Cathedral, to the residence of Duke Michael. Even as I swallowed the last drop of my cup of coffee, the bells throughout all the city broke out into a joyful peal, and the sound of a military band and of men cheering smote upon my ear.", "319": "King Rudolf the Fifth was in his good city of Strelsau! And they shouted outside\u2014", "320": "\u201cGod save the King!\u201d", "321": "Old Sapt\u2019s mouth wrinkled into a smile.", "322": "\u201cGod save \u2018em both!\u201d he whispered. \u201cCourage, lad!\u201d and I felt his hand press my knee.", "323": "With Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt close behind me, I stepped out of the buffet on to the platform. The last thing I did was to feel if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard. A gay group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting me, at their head a tall old man, covered with medals, and of military bearing. He wore the yellow and red ribbon of the Red Rose of Ruritania\u2014which, by the way, decorated my unworthy breast also.", "324": "\u201cMarshal Strakencz,\u201d whispered Sapt, and I knew that I was in the presence of the most famous veteran of the Ruritanian army.", "325": "Just behind the Marshal stood a short spare man, in flowing robes of black and crimson.", "326": "\u201cThe Chancellor of the Kingdom,\u201d whispered Sapt.", "327": "The Marshal greeted me in a few loyal words, and proceeded to deliver an apology from the Duke of Strelsau. The duke, it seemed, had been afflicted with a sudden indisposition which made it impossible for him to come to the station, but he craved leave to await his Majesty at the Cathedral. I expressed my concern, accepted the Marshal\u2019s excuses very suavely, and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished personages. No one betrayed the least suspicion, and I felt my nerve returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding. But Fritz was still pale, and his hand shook like a leaf as he extended it to the Marshal.", "328": "Presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the station. Here I mounted my horse, the Marshal holding my stirrup. The civil dignitaries went off to their carriages, and I started to ride through the streets with the Marshal on my right and Sapt (who, as my chief aide-de-camp, was entitled to the place) on my left. The city of Strelsau is partly old and partly new. Spacious modern boulevards and residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow, tortuous, and picturesque streets of the original town. In the outer circles the upper classes live; in the inner the shops are situated; and, behind their prosperous fronts, lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys, filled with a poverty-stricken, turbulent, and (in large measure) criminal class. These social and local divisions corresponded, as I knew from Sapt\u2019s information, to another division more important to me. The New Town was for the King; but to the Old Town Michael of Strelsau was a hope, a hero, and a darling.", "329": "The scene was very brilliant as we passed along the Grand Boulevard and on to the great square where the Royal Palace stood. Here I was in the midst of my devoted adherents. Every house was hung with red and bedecked with flags and mottoes. The streets were lined with raised seats on each side, and I passed along, bowing this way and that, under a shower of cheers, blessings, and waving handkerchiefs. The balconies were full of gaily dressed ladies, who clapped their hands and curtsied and threw their brightest glances at me. A torrent of red roses fell on me; one bloom lodged in my horse\u2019s mane, and I took it and stuck it in my coat. The Marshal smiled grimly. I had stolen some glances at his face, but he was too impassive to show me whether his sympathies were with me or not.", "330": "\u201cThe red rose for the Elphbergs, Marshal,\u201d said I gaily, and he nodded.", "331": "I have written \u201cgaily,\u201d and a strange word it must seem. But the truth is, that I was drunk with excitement. At that moment I believed\u2014I almost believed\u2014that I was in very truth the King; and, with a look of laughing triumph, I raised my eyes to the beauty-laden balconies again . . . and then I started. For, looking down on me, with her handsome face and proud smile, was the lady who had been my fellow traveller\u2014Antoinette de Mauban; and I saw her also start, and her lips moved, and she leant forward and gazed at me. And I, collecting myself, met her eyes full and square, while again I felt my revolver. Suppose she had cried aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s not the King!\u201d", "332": "Well, we went by; and then the Marshal, turning round in his saddle, waved his hand, and the Cuirassiers closed round us, so that the crowd could not come near me. We were leaving my quarter and entering Duke Michael\u2019s, and this action of the Marshal\u2019s showed me more clearly than words what the state of feeling in the town must be. But if Fate made me a King, the least I could do was to play the part handsomely.", "333": "\u201cWhy this change in our order, Marshal?\u201d said I.", "334": "The Marshal bit his white moustache.", "335": "\u201cIt is more prudent, sire,\u201d he murmured.", "336": "I drew rein.", "337": "\u201cLet those in front ride on,\u201d said I, \u201ctill they are fifty yards ahead. But do you, Marshal, and Colonel Sapt and my friends, wait here till I have ridden fifty yards. And see that no one is nearer to me. I will have my people see that their King trusts them.\u201d", "338": "Sapt laid his hand on my arm. I shook him off. The Marshal hesitated.", "339": "\u201cAm I not understood?\u201d said I; and, biting his moustache again, he gave the orders. I saw old Sapt smiling into his beard, but he shook his head at me. If I had been killed in open day in the streets of Strelsau, Sapt\u2019s position would have been a difficult one.", "340": "Perhaps I ought to say that I was dressed all in white, except my boots. I wore a silver helmet with gilt ornaments, and the broad ribbon of the Rose looked well across my chest. I should be paying a poor compliment to the King if I did not set modesty aside and admit that I made a very fine figure. So the people thought; for when I, riding alone, entered the dingy, sparsely decorated, sombre streets of the Old Town, there was first a murmur, then a cheer, and a woman, from a window above a cookshop, cried the old local saying:", "341": "\u201cIf he\u2019s red, he\u2019s right!\u201d whereat I laughed and took off my helmet that she might see that I was of the right colour and they cheered me again at that.", "342": "It was more interesting riding thus alone, for I heard the comments of the crowd.", "343": "\u201cHe looks paler than his wont,\u201d said one.", "344": "\u201cYou\u2019d look pale if you lived as he does,\u201d was the highly disrespectful retort.", "345": "\u201cHe\u2019s a bigger man than I thought,\u201d said another.", "346": "\u201cSo he had a good jaw under that beard after all,\u201d commented a third.", "347": "\u201cThe pictures of him aren\u2019t handsome enough,\u201d declared a pretty girl, taking great care that I should hear. No doubt it was mere flattery.", "348": "But, in spite of these signs of approval and interest, the mass of the people received me in silence and with sullen looks, and my dear brother\u2019s portrait ornamented most of the windows\u2014which was an ironical sort of greeting to the King. I was quite glad that he had been spared the unpleasant sight. He was a man of quick temper, and perhaps he would not have taken it so placidly as I did.", "349": "At last we were at the Cathedral. Its great grey front, embellished with hundreds of statues and boasting a pair of the finest oak doors in Europe, rose for the first time before me, and the sudden sense of my audacity almost overcame me. Everything was in a mist as I dismounted. I saw the Marshal and Sapt dimly, and dimly the throng of gorgeously robed priests who awaited me. And my eyes were still dim as I walked up the great nave, with the pealing of the organ in my ears. I saw nothing of the brilliant throng that filled it, I hardly distinguished the stately figure of the Cardinal as he rose from the archiepiscopal throne to greet me. Two faces only stood out side by side clearly before my eyes\u2014the face of a girl, pale and lovely, surmounted by a crown of the glorious Elphberg hair (for in a woman it is glorious), and the face of a man, whose full-blooded red cheeks, black hair, and dark deep eyes told me that at last I was in presence of my brother, Black Michael. And when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment, and his helmet fell with a clatter on the floor. Till that moment I believe that he had not realized that the King was in very truth come to Strelsau.", "350": "Of what followed next I remember nothing. I knelt before the altar and the Cardinal anointed my head. Then I rose to my feet, and stretched out my hand and took from him the crown of Ruritania and set it on my head, and I swore the old oath of the King; and (if it were a sin, may it be forgiven me) I received the Holy Sacrament there before them all. Then the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room. The portrait of the King is very good.", "351": "Then the lady with the pale face and the glorious hair, her train held by two pages, stepped from her place and came to where I stood. And a herald cried:", "352": "\u201cHer Royal Highness the Princess Flavia!\u201d", "353": "She curtsied low, and put her hand under mine and raised my hand and kissed it. And for an instant I thought what I had best do. Then I drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek, and she blushed red, and\u2014then his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop slipped in front of Black Michael, and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the Pope\u2014the first and last which I have received from that exalted quarter!", "354": "And then came the Duke of Strelsau. His step trembled, I swear, and he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched. And I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the cheek. I think we were both glad when that was over!", "355": "But neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did I see the least doubt or questioning. Yet, had I and the King stood side by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little consideration. But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that I could be other than the King. So the likeness served, and for an hour I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor Square I had danced a score of times. Thank heaven, the old man was as blind as a bat, and did not claim my acquaintance.", "356": "Then back we went through the streets to the Palace, and I heard them cheering Black Michael; but he, Fritz told me, sat biting his nails like a man in a reverie, and even his own friends said that he should have made a braver show. I was in a carriage now, side by side with the Princess Flavia, and a rough fellow cried out:", "357": "\u201cAnd when\u2019s the wedding?\u201d and as he spoke another struck him in the face, crying \u201cLong live Duke Michael!\u201d and the princess coloured\u2014it was an admirable tint\u2014and looked straight in front of her.", "358": "Now I felt in a difficulty, because I had forgotten to ask Sapt the state of my affections, or how far matters had gone between the princess and myself. Frankly, had I been the King, the further they had gone the better should I have been pleased. For I am not a slow-blooded man, and I had not kissed Princess Flavia\u2019s cheek for nothing. These thoughts passed through my head, but, not being sure of my ground, I said nothing; and in a moment or two the princess, recovering her equanimity, turned to me.", "359": "\u201cDo you know, Rudolf,\u201d said she, \u201cyou look somehow different today?\u201d", "360": "The fact was not surprising, but the remark was disquieting.", "361": "\u201cYou look,\u201d she went on, \u201cmore sober, more sedate; you\u2019re almost careworn, and I declare you\u2019re thinner. Surely it\u2019s not possible that you\u2019ve begun to take anything seriously?\u201d", "362": "The princess seemed to hold of the King much the same opinion that Lady Burlesdon held of me.", "363": "I braced myself up to the conversation.", "364": "\u201cWould that please you?\u201d I asked softly.", "365": "\u201cOh, you know my views,\u201d said she, turning her eyes away.", "366": "\u201cWhatever pleases you I try to do,\u201d I said; and, as I saw her smile and blush, I thought that I was playing the King\u2019s hand very well for him. So I continued and what I said was perfectly true:", "367": "\u201cI assure you, my dear cousin, that nothing in my life has affected me more than the reception I\u2019ve been greeted with today.\u201d", "368": "She smiled brightly, but in an instant grew grave again, and whispered:", "369": "\u201cDid you notice Michael?\u201d", "370": "\u201cYes,\u201d said I, adding, \u201che wasn\u2019t enjoying himself.\u201d", "371": "\u201cDo be careful!\u201d she went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014indeed you don\u2019t\u2014keep enough watch on him. You know\u2014\u201d", "372": "\u201cI know,\u201d said I, \u201cthat he wants what I\u2019ve got.\u201d", "373": "\u201cYes. Hush!\u201d", "374": "Then\u2014and I can\u2019t justify it, for I committed the King far beyond what I had a right to do\u2014I suppose she carried me off my feet\u2014I went on:", "375": "\u201cAnd perhaps also something which I haven\u2019t got yet, but hope to win some day.\u201d", "376": "This was my answer. Had I been the King, I should have thought it encouraging:", "377": "\u201cHaven\u2019t you enough responsibilities on you for one day, cousin?\u201d", "378": "Bang, bang! Blare, blare! We were at the Palace. Guns were firing and trumpets blowing. Rows of lackeys stood waiting, and, handing the princess up the broad marble staircase, I took formal possession, as a crowned King, of the House of my ancestors, and sat down at my own table, with my cousin on my right hand, on her other side Black Michael, and on my left his Eminence the Cardinal. Behind my chair stood Sapt; and at the end of the table, I saw Fritz von Tarlenheim drain to the bottom his glass of champagne rather sooner than he decently should.", "379": "I wondered what the King of Ruritania was doing.", "380": "We were in the King\u2019s dressing-room\u2014Fritz von Tarlenheim, Sapt, and I. I flung myself exhausted into an armchair. Sapt lit his pipe. He uttered no congratulations on the marvellous success of our wild risk, but his whole bearing was eloquent of satisfaction. The triumph, aided perhaps by good wine, had made a new man of Fritz.", "381": "\u201cWhat a day for you to remember!\u201d he cried. \u201cGad, I\u2019d like to be King for twelve hours myself! But, Rassendyll, you mustn\u2019t throw your heart too much into the part. I don\u2019t wonder Black Michael looked blacker than ever\u2014you and the princess had so much to say to one another.\u201d", "382": "\u201cHow beautiful she is!\u201d I exclaimed.", "383": "\u201cNever mind the woman,\u201d growled Sapt. \u201cAre you ready to start?\u201d", "384": "\u201cYes,\u201d said I, with a sigh.", "385": "It was five o\u2019clock, and at twelve I should be no more than Rudolf Rassendyll. I remarked on it in a joking tone.", "386": "\u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky,\u201d observed Sapt grimly, \u201cif you\u2019re not the late Rudolf Rassendyll. By Heaven! I feel my head wobbling on my shoulders every minute you\u2019re in the city. Do you know, friend, that Michael has had news from Zenda? He went into a room alone to read it\u2014and he came out looking like a man dazed.\u201d", "387": "\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d said I, this news making me none the more eager to linger.", "388": "Sapt sat down.", "389": "\u201cI must write us an order to leave the city. Michael\u2019s Governor, you know, and we must be prepared for hindrances. You must sign the order.\u201d", "390": "\u201cMy dear colonel, I\u2019ve not been bred a forger!\u201d", "391": "Out of his pocket Sapt produced a piece of paper.", "392": "\u201cThere\u2019s the King\u2019s signature,\u201d he said, \u201cand here,\u201d he went on, after another search in his pocket, \u201cis some tracing paper.

Then we came to a stout oak door. Sapt unlocked it. We passed through, and found ourselves in a quiet street that ran along the back of the Palace gardens. A man was waiting for us with two horses. One was a magnificent bay, up to any weight; the other a sturdy brown. Sapt signed to me to mount the bay. Without a word to the man, we mounted and rode away. The town was full of noise and merriment, but we took secluded ways. My cloak was wrapped over half my face; the capacious flat cap hid every lock of my tell-tale hair. By Sapt\u2019s directions, I crouched on my saddle, and rode with such a round back as I hope never to exhibit on a horse again. Down a long narrow lane we went, meeting some wanderers and some roisterers; and, as we rode, we heard the Cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to the King. It was half-past six, and still light. At last we came to the city wall and to a gate.", "411": "\u201cHave your weapon ready,\u201d whispered Sapt. \u201cWe must stop his mouth, if he talks.\u201d", "412": "I put my hand on my revolver. Sapt hailed the doorkeeper. The stars fought for us! A little girl of fourteen tripped out.", "413": "\u201cPlease, sir, father\u2019s gone to see the King.\u201d", "414": "\u201cHe\u2019d better have stayed here,\u201d said Sapt to me, grinning.", "415": "\u201cBut he said I wasn\u2019t to open the gate, sir.\u201d", "416": "\u201cDid he, my dear?\u201d said Sapt, dismounting. \u201cThen give me the key.\u201d", "417": "The key was in the child\u2019s hand. Sapt gave her a crown.", "418": "\u201cHere\u2019s an order from the King. Show it to your father. Orderly, open the gate!\u201d", "419": "I leapt down. Between us we rolled back the great gate, led our horses out, and closed it again.", "420": "\u201cI shall be sorry for the doorkeeper if Michael finds out that he wasn\u2019t there. Now then, lad, for a canter. We mustn\u2019t go too fast while we\u2019re near the town.\u201d", "421": "Once, however, outside the city, we ran little danger, for everybody else was inside, merry-making; and as the evening fell we quickened our pace, my splendid horse bounding along under me as though I had been a feather. It was a fine night, and presently the moon appeared. We talked little on the way, and chiefly about the progress we were making.", "422": "\u201cI wonder what the duke\u2019s despatches told him,\u201d said I, once.", "423": "\u201cAy, I wonder!\u201d responded Sapt.", "424": "We stopped for a draught of wine and to bait our horses, losing half an hour thus. I dared not go into the inn, and stayed with the horses in the stable. Then we went ahead again, and had covered some five-and-twenty miles, when Sapt abruptly stopped.", "425": "\u201cHark!\u201d he cried.", "426": "I listened. Away, far behind us, in the still of the evening\u2014it was just half-past nine\u2014we heard the beat of horses\u2019 hoofs. The wind blowing strong behind us, carried the sound. I glanced at Sapt.", "427": "\u201cCome on!\u201d he cried, and spurred his horse into a gallop. When we next paused to listen, the hoof-beats were not audible, and we relaxed our pace. Then we heard them again. Sapt jumped down and laid his ear to the ground.", "428": "\u201cThere are two,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re only a mile behind. Thank God the road curves in and out, and the wind\u2019s our way.\u201d", "429": "We galloped on. We seemed to be holding our own. We had entered the outskirts of the forest of Zenda, and the trees, closing in behind us as the track zigged and zagged, prevented us seeing our pursuers, and them from seeing us.", "430": "Another half-hour brought us to a divide of the road. Sapt drew rein.", "431": "\u201cTo the right is our road,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the left, to the Castle. Each about eight miles. Get down.\u201d", "432": "\u201cBut they\u2019ll be on us!\u201d I cried.", "433": "\u201cGet down!\u201d he repeated brusquely; and I obeyed. The wood was dense up to the very edge of the road. We led our horses into the covert, bound handkerchiefs over their eyes, and stood beside them.", "434": "\u201cYou want to see who they are?\u201d I whispered.", "435": "\u201cAy, and where they\u2019re going,\u201d he answered.", "436": "I saw that his revolver was in his hand.", "437": "Nearer and nearer came the hoofs. The moon shone out now clear and full, so that the road was white with it. The ground was hard, and we had left no traces.", "438": "\u201cHere they come!\u201d whispered Sapt.", "439": "\u201cIt\u2019s the duke!\u201d", "440": "\u201cI thought so,\u201d he answered.", "441": "It was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who had cause to know me afterwards\u2014Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper, and body-servant to his Highness. They were up to us: the duke reined up. I saw Sapt\u2019s finger curl lovingly towards the trigger. I believe he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a farmyard. I laid my hand on his arm. He nodded reassuringly: he was always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty.", "442": "\u201cWhich way?\u201d asked Black Michael.", "443": "\u201cTo the Castle, your Highness,\u201d urged his companion. \u201cThere we shall learn the truth.\u201d", "444": "For an instant the duke hesitated.", "445": "\u201cI thought I heard hoofs,\u201d said he.", "446": "\u201cI think not, your Highness.\u201d", "447": "\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we go to the lodge?\u201d", "448": "\u201cI fear a trap. If all is well, why go to the lodge? If not, it\u2019s a snare to trap us.\u201d", "449": "Suddenly the duke\u2019s horse neighed. In an instant we folded our cloaks close round our horses\u2019 heads, and, holding them thus, covered the duke and his attendant with our revolvers. If they had found us, they had been dead men, or our prisoners.", "450": "Michael waited a moment longer. Then he cried:", "451": "\u201cTo Zenda, then!\u201d and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.", "452": "Sapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out laughing.", "453": "For ten minutes we stayed where we were.", "454": "\u201cYou see,\u201d said Sapt, \u201cthey\u2019ve sent him news that all is well.\u201d", "455": "\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.", "456": "\u201cGod knows,\u201d said Sapt, frowning heavily. \u201cBut it\u2019s brought him from Strelsau in a rare puzzle.\u201d", "457": "Then we mounted, and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their feet to the ground. For those last eight miles we spoke no more. Our minds were full of apprehension. \u201cAll is well.\u201d What did it mean? Was all well with the King?", "458": "At last the lodge came in sight. Spurring our horses to a last gallop, we rode up to the gate. All was still and quiet. Not a soul came to meet us. We dismounted in haste. Suddenly Sapt caught me by the arm.", "459": "\u201cLook there!\u201d he said, pointing to the ground.", "460": "I looked down. At my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs, torn and slashed and rent. I turned to him questioningly.", "461": "\u201cThey\u2019re what I tied the old woman up with,\u201d said he. \u201cFasten the horses, and come along.\u201d", "462": "The handle of the door turned without resistance. We passed into the room which had been the scene of last night\u2019s bout. It was still strewn with the remnants of our meal and with empty bottles.", "463": "\u201cCome on,\u201d cried Sapt, whose marvellous composure had at last almost given way.", "464": "We rushed down the passage towards the cellars. The door of the coal-cellar stood wide open.", "465": "\u201cThey found the old woman,\u201d said I.", "466": "\u201cYou might have known that from the handkerchiefs,\u201d he said.", "467": "Then we came opposite the door of the wine-cellar. It was shut. It looked in all respects as it had looked when we left it that morning.", "468": "\u201cCome, it\u2019s all right,\u201d said I.", "469": "A loud oath from Sapt rang out. His face turned pale, and he pointed again at the floor. From under the door a red stain had spread over the floor of the passage and dried there. Sapt sank against the opposite wall. I tried the door. It was locked.", "470": "\u201cWhere\u2019s Josef?\u201d muttered Sapt.", "471": "\u201cWhere\u2019s the King?\u201d I responded.", "472": "Sapt took out a flask and put it to his lips. I ran back to the dining-room, and seized a heavy poker from the fireplace. In my terror and excitement I rained blows on the lock of the door, and I fired a cartridge into it. It gave way, and the door swung open.", "473": "\u201cGive me a light,\u201d said I; but Sapt still leant against the wall.", "474": "He was, of course, more moved than I, for he loved his master. Afraid for himself he was not\u2014no man ever saw him that; but to think what might lie in that dark cellar was enough to turn any man\u2019s face pale. I went myself, and took a silver candlestick from the dining-table and struck a light, and, as I returned, I felt the hot wax drip on my naked hand as the candle swayed to and fro; so that I cannot afford to despise Colonel Sapt for his agitation.", "475": "I came to the door of the cellar. The red stain turning more and more to a dull brown, stretched inside. I walked two yards into the cellar, and held the candle high above my head. I saw the full bins of wine; I saw spiders crawling on the walls; I saw, too, a couple of empty bottles lying on the floor; and then, away in the corner, I saw the body of a man, lying flat on his back, with his arms stretched wide, and a crimson gash across his throat. I walked to him and knelt down beside him, and commended to God the soul of a faithful man. For it was the body of Josef, the little servant, slain in guarding the King.", "476": "I felt a hand on my shoulders, and, turning, saw Sapt, eyes glaring and terror-struck, beside me.", "477": "\u201cThe King? My God! the King?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.", "478": "I threw the candle\u2019s gleam over every inch of the cellar.", "479": "\u201cThe King is not here,\u201d said I.", "480": "I put my arm round Sapt\u2019s waist and supported him out of the cellar, drawing the battered door close after me. For ten minutes or more we sat silent in the dining-room. Then old Sapt rubbed his knuckles into his eyes, gave one great gasp, and was himself again. As the clock on the mantelpiece struck one he stamped his foot on the floor, saying:", "481": "\u201cThey\u2019ve got the King!\u201d", "482": "\u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201c\u2018all\u2019s well!\u2019 as Black Michael\u2019s despatch said.

I wonder when he got the message?\u201d", "483": "\u201cIt must have been sent in the morning,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cThey must have sent it before news of your arrival at Strelsau reached Zenda\u2014I suppose it came from Zenda.\u201d", "484": "\u201cAnd he\u2019s carried it about all day!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cUpon my honour, I\u2019m not the only man who\u2019s had a trying day! What did he think, Sapt?\u201d", "485": "\u201cWhat does that matter? What does he think, lad, now?\u201d", "486": "I rose to my feet.", "487": "\u201cWe must get back,\u201d I said, \u201cand rouse every soldier in Strelsau.

I see the game. They came up to kidnap the King, and\u2014as I say\u2014somehow they found him.

Sapt told me afterwards that he killed a man, and I believe him; but I saw no more of him. With a cut, I split the head of a fellow on a brown horse, and he fell to the ground. Then I found myself opposite a big man, and I was half conscious of another to my right. It was too warm to stay, and with a simultaneous action I drove my spurs into my horse again and my sword full into the big man\u2019s breast. His bullet whizzed past my ear\u2014I could almost swear it touched it. I wrenched at the sword, but it would not come, and I dropped it and galloped after Sapt, whom I now saw about twenty yards ahead. I waved my hand in farewell, and dropped it a second later with a yell, for a bullet had grazed my finger and I felt the blood. Old Sapt turned round in the saddle. Someone fired again, but they had no rifles, and we were out of range. Sapt fell to laughing.", "551": "\u201cThat\u2019s one to me and two to you, with decent luck,\u201d said he. \u201cLittle Josef will have company.\u201d", "552": "\u201cAy, they\u2019ll be a partie carree,\u201d said I.

Then we rode on, asking of our good horses all that was in them. The excitement of the fight and of our great resolve died away, and we rode in gloomy silence. Day broke clear and cold. We found a farmer just up, and made him give us sustenance for ourselves and our horses. I, feigning a toothache, muffled my face closely. Then ahead again, till Strelsau lay before us. It was eight o\u2019clock or nearing nine, and the gates were all open, as they always were save when the duke\u2019s caprice or intrigues shut them. We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before, all four of us\u2014the men and the horses\u2014wearied and jaded. The streets were even quieter than when we had gone: everyone was sleeping off last night\u2019s revelry, and we met hardly a soul till we reached the little gate of the Palace.

On the next day, Sapt instructed me in my duties\u2014what I ought to do and what I ought to know\u2014for three hours; then I snatched breakfast, with Sapt still opposite me, telling me that the King always took white wine in the morning and was known to detest all highly seasoned dishes. Then came the Chancellor, for another three hours; and to him I had to explain that the hurt to my finger (we turned that bullet to happy account) prevented me from writing\u2014whence arose great to-do, hunting of precedents and so forth, ending in my \u201cmaking my mark,\u201d and the Chancellor attesting it with a superfluity of solemn oaths. Then the French ambassador was introduced, to present his credentials; here my ignorance was of no importance, as the King would have been equally raw to the business (we worked through the whole corps diplomatique in the next few days, a demise of the Crown necessitating all this bother).", "584": "Then, at last, I was left alone.

I had fully resolved on my course of action. I meant to make myself as popular as I could, and at the same time to show no disfavour to Michael. By these means I hoped to allay the hostility of his adherents, and make it appear, if an open conflict came about, that he was ungrateful and not oppressed.", "613": "Yet an open conflict was not what I hoped for.", "614": "The King\u2019s interest demanded secrecy; and while secrecy lasted, I had a fine game to play in Strelsau, Michael should not grow stronger for delay!", "615": "I ordered my horse, and, attended by Fritz von Tarlenheim, rode in the grand new avenue of the Royal Park, returning all the salutes which I received with punctilious politeness. Then I rode through a few of the streets, stopped and bought flowers of a pretty girl, paying her with a piece of gold; and then, having attracted the desired amount of attention (for I had a trail of half a thousand people after me), I rode to the residence of the Princess Flavia, and asked if she would receive me. This step created much interest, and was met with shouts of approval. The princess was very popular, and the Chancellor himself had not scrupled to hint to me that the more I pressed my suit, and the more rapidly I brought it to a prosperous conclusion, the stronger should I be in the affection of my subjects. The Chancellor, of course, did not understand the difficulties which lay in the way of following his loyal and excellent advice. However, I thought I could do no harm by calling; and in this view Fritz supported me with a cordiality that surprised me, until he confessed that he also had his motives for liking a visit to the princess\u2019s house, which motive was no other than a great desire to see the princess\u2019s lady-in-waiting and bosom friend, the Countess Helga von Strofzin.", "616": "Etiquette seconded Fritz\u2019s hopes. While I was ushered into the princess\u2019s room, he remained with the countess in the ante-chamber: in spite of the people and servants who were hanging about, I doubt not that they managed a tete-a-tete; but I had no leisure to think of them, for I was playing the most delicate move in all my difficult game. I had to keep the princess devoted to me\u2014and yet indifferent to me: I had to show affection for her\u2014and not feel it. I had to make love for another, and that to a girl who\u2014princess or no princess\u2014was the most beautiful I had ever seen. Well, I braced myself to the task, made no easier by the charming embarrassment with which I was received.

It was not very heavy for a man of my strength, and I held it by the legs. The top, protruding in front of me, made a complete screen for my head and body. I fastened my closed lantern to my belt and put my revolver in a handy pocket. Suddenly I saw the door move ever so slightly\u2014perhaps it was the wind, perhaps it was a hand trying it outside.", "818": "I drew back as far as I could from the door, holding the table in the position that I have described.

The gleam of a lantern showed me the three close together outside, their revolvers levelled. With a shout, I charged at my utmost pace across the summer-house and through the doorway. Three shots rang out and battered into my shield. Another moment, and I leapt out and the table caught them full and square, and in a tumbling, swearing, struggling mass, they and I and that brave table, rolled down the steps of the summerhouse to the ground below. Antoinette de Mauban shrieked, but I rose to my feet, laughing aloud.", "826": "De Gautet and Bersonin lay like men stunned. Detchard was under the table, but, as I rose, he pushed it from him and fired again. I raised my revolver and took a snap shot; I heard him curse, and then I ran like a hare, laughing as I went, past the summer-house and along by the wall. I heard steps behind me, and turning round I fired again for luck. The steps ceased.", "827": "\u201cPlease God,\u201d said I, \u201cshe told me the truth about the ladder!\u201d for the wall was high and topped with iron spikes.", "828": "Yes, there it was. I was up and over in a minute. Doubling back, I saw the horses; then I heard a shot. It was Sapt. He had heard us, and was battling and raging with the locked gate, hammering it and firing into the keyhole like a man possessed. He had quite forgotten that he was not to take part in the fight. Whereat I laughed again, and said, as I clapped him on the shoulder:", "829": "\u201cCome home to bed, old chap.

Since I had been in Strelsau, Sapt had been in the habit of reading the report and telling me any items of interest which it might contain. On the day after my adventure in the summer-house, he came in as I was playing a hand of ecarte with Fritz von Tarlenheim.", "835": "\u201cThe report is rather full of interest this afternoon,\u201d he observed, sitting down.", "836": "\u201cDo you find,\u201d I asked, \u201cany mention of a certain fracas?\u201d", "837": "He shook his head with a smile.", "838": "\u201cI find this first,\u201d he said: \u201c\u2018His Highness the Duke of Strelsau left the city (so far as it appears, suddenly), accompanied by several of his household. His destination is believed to be the Castle of Zenda, but the party travelled by road and not by train. MM De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard followed an hour later, the last-named carrying his arm in a sling. The cause of his wound is not known, but it is suspected that he has fought a duel, probably incidental to a love affair.\u2019\u201d", "839": "\u201cThat is remotely true,\u201d I observed, very well pleased to find that I had left my mark on the fellow.", "840": "\u201cThen we come to this,\u201d pursued Sapt: \u201c\u2018Madame de Mauban, whose movements have been watched according to instructions, left by train at midday.

And finally listen to this: \u2018The state of feeling in the city is not satisfactory. The King is much criticized\u2019 (you know, he\u2019s told to be quite frank) \u2018for taking no steps about his marriage. From enquiries among the entourage of the Princess Flavia, her Royal Highness is believed to be deeply offended by the remissness of his Majesty. The common people are coupling her name with that of the Duke of Strelsau, and the duke gains much popularity from the suggestion.\u2019 I have caused the announcement that the King gives a ball tonight in honour of the princess to be widely diffused, and the effect is good.\u201d", "843": "\u201cThat is news to me,\u201d said I.", "844": "\u201cOh, the preparations are all made!\u201d laughed Fritz. \u201cI\u2019ve seen to that.\u201d", "845": "Sapt turned to me and said, in a sharp, decisive voice:", "846": "\u201cYou must make love to her tonight, you know.\u201d", "847": "\u201cI think it is very likely I shall, if I see her alone,\u201d said I. \u201cHang it, Sapt, you don\u2019t suppose I find it difficult?\u201d", "848": "Fritz whistled a bar or two; then he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll find it only too easy. Look here, I hate telling you this, but I must. The Countess Helga told me that the princess had become most attached to the King. Since the coronation, her feelings have undergone a marked development. It\u2019s quite true that she is deeply wounded by the King\u2019s apparent neglect.\u201d", "849": "\u201cHere\u2019s a kettle of fish!\u201d I groaned.", "850": "\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Sapt. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve made pretty speeches to a girl before now? That\u2019s all she wants.\u201d", "851": "Fritz, himself a lover, understood better my distress. He laid his hand on my shoulder, but said nothing.", "852": "\u201cI think, though,\u201d pursued that cold-blooded old Sapt, \u201cthat you\u2019d better make your offer tonight.\u201d", "853": "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d", "854": "\u201cOr, any rate, go near it: and I shall send a \u2018semi-official\u2019 to the papers.\u201d", "855": "\u201cI\u2019ll do nothing of the sort\u2014no more will you!\u201d said I. \u201cI utterly refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess.\u201d", "856": "Sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes.

His rough manner covered a wonderful tact\u2014and as I came to recognize more and more, a remarkable knowledge of human nature. Why did he urge me so little about the princess? Because he knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his arguments\u2014and that the less I thought about the thing, the more likely was I to do it. He must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the princess; but that went for nothing with him. Can I say, confidently, that he was wrong? If the King were restored, the princess must turn to him, either knowing or not knowing the change. And if the King were not restored to us? It was a subject that we had never yet spoken of. But I had an idea that, in such a case, Sapt meant to seat me on the throne of Ruritania for the term of my life. He would have set Satan himself there sooner than that pupil of his, Black Michael.", "860": "The ball was a sumptuous affair. I opened it by dancing a quadrille with Flavia: then I waltzed with her. Curious eyes and eager whispers attended us. We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my stammered sentences\u2014I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd, and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled badge round her neck. In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning. The rest of the meal passed in silence; neither Flavia nor I could speak. Fritz touched me on the shoulder, and I rose, gave her my arm, and walked down the hall into a little room, where coffee was served to us. The gentlemen and ladies in attendance withdrew, and we were alone.", "861": "The little room had French windows opening on the gardens. The night was fine, cool, and fragrant. Flavia sat down, and I stood opposite her. I was struggling with myself: if she had not looked at me, I believe that even then I should have won my fight. But suddenly, involuntarily, she gave me one brief glance\u2014a glance of question, hurriedly turned aside; a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek, and she caught her breath. Ah, if you had seen her! I forgot the King in Zenda. I forgot the King in Strelsau. She was a princess\u2014and I an impostor. Do you think I remembered that? I threw myself on my knee and seized her hands in mine. I said nothing. Why should I? The soft sounds of the night set my wooing to a wordless melody, as I pressed my kisses on her lips.", "862": "She pushed me from her, crying suddenly:", "863": "\u201cAh! is it true? or is it only because you must?\u201d", "864": "\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d I said, in low smothered tones\u2014\u201ctrue that I love you more than life\u2014or truth\u2014or honour!\u201d", "865": "She set no meaning to my words, treating them as one of love\u2019s sweet extravagances.

To uphold the Crown and beat Black Michael\u2014that was his one resolve. Flavia, myself\u2014ay, and the real King in Zenda, were pieces in his game; and pawns have no business with passions. Not even at the walls of the Palace did he stop; for when at last I handed Flavia down the broad marble steps and into her carriage, there was a great crowd awaiting us, and we were welcomed with deafening cheers. What could I do? Had I spoken then, they would have refused to believe that I was not the King; they might have believed that the King had run mad. By Sapt\u2019s devices and my own ungoverned passion I had been forced on, and the way back had closed behind me; and the passion still drove me in the same direction as the devices seduced me.

I was in a position to bid him defiance and tighten my grasp on the crown\u2014not for its own sake, but because the King of Ruritania was to wed the Princess Flavia. What of Sapt and Fritz? Ah! but a man cannot be held to write down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them. Yet, unless he sets up as a saint, he need not hate himself for them. He is better employed, as it humbly seems to me, in giving thanks that power to resist was vouchsafed to him, than in fretting over wicked impulses which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the weakness of our nature.", "928": "It was a fine bright morning when I walked, unattended, to the princess\u2019s house, carrying a nosegay in my hand.

I found Fritz\u2019s inamorata, the Countess Helga, gathering blooms in the garden for her mistress\u2019s wear, and prevailed on her to take mine in their place.

As things were now, I had more work than Sapt and Fritz could manage, for they must come with me to Zenda, and I wanted a man to guard what I loved most in all the world, and suffer me to set about my task of releasing the King with a quiet mind.", "947": "The Marshal received me with most loyal kindness.

Fritz, too, was ready; though he, poor fellow, risked more than Sapt did, for he was a lover, and his happiness hung in the scale. Yet how I envied him! For the triumphant issue which would crown him with happiness and unite him to his mistress, the success for which we were bound to hope and strive and struggle, meant to me sorrow more certain and greater than if I were doomed to fail.

And his figure\u2014the lithe, buoyant figure I had met in the woods of Zenda\u2014the dull, inert mass I had left in the cellar of the hunting-lodge\u2014seemed to rise, double-shaped, before me, and to come between us, thrusting itself in even where she lay, pale, exhausted, fainting, in my arms, and yet looking up at me with those eyes that bore such love as I have never seen, and haunt me now, and will till the ground closes over me\u2014and (who knows?) perhaps beyond.", "1031": "About five miles from Zenda\u2014on the opposite side from that on which the Castle is situated, there lies a large tract of wood. It is rising ground, and in the centre of the demesne, on the top of the hill, stands a fine modern chateau, the property of a distant kinsman of Fritz\u2019s, the Count Stanislas von Tarlenheim. Count Stanislas himself was a student and a recluse. He seldom visited the house, and had, on Fritz\u2019s request, very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and my party. This, then, was our destination; chosen ostensibly for the sake of the boar-hunting (for the wood was carefully preserved, and boars, once common all over Ruritania, were still to be found there in considerable numbers), really because it brought us within striking distance of the Duke of Strelsau\u2019s more magnificent dwelling on the other side of the town. A large party of servants, with horses and luggage, started early in the morning; we followed at midday, travelling by train for thirty miles, and then mounting our horses to ride the remaining distance to the chateau.", "1032": "We were a gallant party. Besides Sapt and Fritz, I was accompanied by ten gentlemen: every one of them had been carefully chosen, and no less carefully sounded, by my two friends, and all were devotedly attached to the person of the King. They were told a part of the truth; the attempt on my life in the summer-house was revealed to them, as a spur to their loyalty and an incitement against Michael. They were also informed that a friend of the King\u2019s was suspected to be forcibly confined within the Castle of Zenda. His rescue was one of the objects of the expedition; but, it was added, the King\u2019s main desire was to carry into effect certain steps against his treacherous brother, as to the precise nature of which they could not at present be further enlightened. Enough that the King commanded their services, and would rely on their devotion when occasion arose to call for it. Young, well-bred, brave, and loyal, they asked no more: they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience, and prayed for a fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it.", "1033": "Thus the scene was shifted from Strelsau to the chateau of Tarlenheim and Castle of Zenda, which frowned at us across the valley. I tried to shift my thoughts also, to forget my love, and to bend all my energies to the task before me. It was to get the King out of the Castle alive. Force was useless: in some trick lay the chance; and I had already an inkling of what we must do. But I was terribly hampered by the publicity which attended my movements. Michael must know by now of my expedition; and I knew Michael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by the feint of the boar-hunt. He would understand very well what the real quarry was. That, however, must be risked\u2014that and all it might mean; for Sapt, no less than myself, recognized that the present state of things had become unendurable. And there was one thing that I dared to calculate on\u2014not, as I now know, without warrant. It was this\u2014that Black Michael would not believe that I meant well by the King. He could not appreciate\u2014I will not say an honest man, for the thoughts of my own heart have been revealed\u2014but a man acting honestly. He saw my opportunity as I had seen it, as Sapt had seen it; he knew the princess\u2014nay (and I declare that a sneaking sort of pity for him invaded me), in his way he loved her; he would think that Sapt and Fritz could be bribed, so the bribe was large enough. Thinking thus, would he kill the King, my rival and my danger? Ay, verily, that he would, with as little compunction as he would kill a rat. But he would kill Rudolf Rassendyll first, if he could; and nothing but the certainty of being utterly damned by the release of the King alive and his restoration to the throne would drive him to throw away the trump card which he held in reserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor Rassendyll. Musing on all this as I rode along, I took courage.", "1034": "Michael knew of my coming, sure enough. I had not been in the house an hour, when an imposing Embassy arrived from him. He did not quite reach the impudence of sending my would-be assassins, but he sent the other three of his famous Six\u2014the three Ruritanian gentlemen\u2014Lauengram, Krafstein, and Rupert Hentzau. A fine, strapping trio they were, splendidly horsed and admirably equipped. Young Rupert, who looked a dare-devil, and could not have been more than twenty-two or twenty-three, took the lead, and made us the neatest speech, wherein my devoted subject and loving brother Michael of Strelsau, prayed me to pardon him for not paying his addresses in person, and, further, for not putting his Castle at my disposal; the reason for both of these apparent derelictions being that he and several of his servants lay sick of scarlet fever, and were in a very sad, and also a very infectious state. So declared young Rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip and a toss of his thick hair\u2014he was a handsome villain, and the gossip ran that many a lady had troubled her heart for him already.", "1035": "\u201cIf my brother has scarlet fever,\u201d said I, \u201che is nearer my complexion than he is wont to be, my lord.

I heard the last had suffered a hurt.\u201d", "1038": "Lauengram and Krafstein looked glum and uneasy, but young Rupert\u2019s smile grew broader.", "1039": "\u201cHe hopes soon to find a medicine for it, sire,\u201d he answered.", "1040": "And I burst out laughing, for I knew what medicine Detchard longed for\u2014it is called Revenge.", "1041": "\u201cYou will dine with us, gentlemen?\u201d I asked.", "1042": "Young Rupert was profuse in apologies.

May it make us better acquainted.\u201d", "1044": "\u201cWe will pray your Majesty for an early opportunity,\u201d quoth Rupert airily; and he strode past Sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that I saw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night.", "1045": "For my part, if a man must needs be a knave, I would have him a debonair knave, and I liked Rupert Hentzau better than his long-faced, close-eyed companions. It makes your sin no worse, as I conceive, to do it a la mode and stylishly.", "1046": "Now it was a curious thing that on this first night, instead of eating the excellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me, I must needs leave my gentlemen to eat it alone, under Sapt\u2019s presiding care, and ride myself with Fritz to the town of Zenda and a certain little inn that I knew of. There was little danger in the excursion; the evenings were long and light, and the road this side of Zenda well frequented. So off we rode, with a groom behind us. I muffled myself up in a big cloak.", "1047": "\u201cFritz,\u201d said I, as we entered the town, \u201cthere\u2019s an uncommonly pretty girl at this inn.\u201d", "1048": "\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asked.", "1049": "\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been there,\u201d said I.", "1050": "\u201cSince\u2014?\u201d he began.", "1051": "\u201cNo. Before,\u201d said I.", "1052": "\u201cBut they\u2019ll recognize you?\u201d", "1053": "\u201cWell, of course they will.

Thus was I engaged when young Rupert Hentzau, who feared neither man nor devil, and rode through the demesne\u2014where every tree might hide a marksman, for all he knew\u2014as though it had been the park at Strelsau, cantered up to where I lay, bowing with burlesque deference, and craving private speech with me in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau.

Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse, and dismissed the fellow with a crown. The horse stood near. I stood still, suspecting nothing. Rupert made as though to mount; then he suddenly turned to me: his left hand resting in his belt, his right outstretched: \u201cShake hands,\u201d he said.", "1159": "I bowed, and did as he had foreseen\u2014I put my hands behind me. Quicker than thought, his left hand darted out at me, and a small dagger flashed in the air; he struck me in the left shoulder\u2014had I not swerved, it had been my heart. With a cry, I staggered back. Without touching the stirrup, he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow, pursued by cries and revolver shots\u2014the last as useless as the first\u2014and I sank into my chair, bleeding profusely, as I watched the devil\u2019s brat disappear down the long avenue. My friends surrounded me, and then I fainted.", "1160": "I suppose that I was put to bed, and there lay, unconscious, or half conscious, for many hours; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind, and found Fritz beside me. I was weak and weary, but he bade me be of good cheer, saying that my wound would soon heal, and that meanwhile all had gone well, for Johann, the keeper, had fallen into the snare we had laid for him, and was even now in the house.", "1161": "\u201cAnd the queer thing is,\u201d pursued Fritz, \u201cthat I fancy he\u2019s not altogether sorry to find himself here.

I ordered him to be brought in at once. Sapt conducted him, and set him in a chair by my bedside. He was sullen, and afraid; but, to say truth, after young Rupert\u2019s exploit, we also had our fears, and, if he got as far as possible from Sapt\u2019s formidable six-shooter, Sapt kept him as far as he could from me. Moreover, when he came in his hands were bound, but that I would not suffer.", "1163": "I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow\u2014all of which were honourably observed and paid, so that he lives now in prosperity (though where I may not mention); and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked, and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done. But he had persuaded all of his loyalty; and though not in their secret counsels, was yet, by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle, able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices. And here, in brief, is his story:", "1164": "Below the level of the ground in the Castle, approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge, were situated two small rooms, cut out of the rock itself. The outer of the two had no windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square window, which gave upon the moat. In the outer room there lay always, day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves. But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side. Thus, before the outer door were stormed, the King would be dead. And his body? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself.", "1165": "\u201cNay, sir,\u201d said Johann, \u201chis Highness has thought of that. While the two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge). The window now gives no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe. The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for, lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe. He inserts the feet in the pipe, and pushes the body down. Silently, without splash or sound, it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat, which is twenty feet deep thereabouts. This done, the murderer cries loudly, \u2018All\u2019s well!\u2019 and himself slides down the pipe; and the others, if they can and the attack is not too hot, run to the inner room and, seeking a moment\u2019s delay, bar the door, and in their turn slide down. And though the King rises not from the bottom, they rise and swim round to the other side, where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes, to haul them out, and horses. And here, if things go ill, the duke will join them and seek safety by riding; but if all goes well, they will return to the Castle, and have their enemies in a trap. That, sir, is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need. But it is not to be used till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir. Now, sir, I have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the world\u2014a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him!\u201d", "1166": "The fellow\u2019s story was rudely told, but our questions supplemented his narrative. What he had told us applied to an armed attack; but if suspicions were aroused, and there came overwhelming force\u2014such, for instance, as I, the King, could bring\u2014the idea of resistance would be abandoned; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe. And\u2014here comes an ingenious touch\u2014one of the Six would take his place in the cell, and, on the entrance of the searchers, loudly demand release and redress; and Michael, being summoned, would confess to hasty action, but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour of a lady in the Castle (this was Antoinette de Mauban) and he had confined him there, as he conceived he, as Lord of Zenda, had right to do. But he was now, on receiving his apology, content to let him go, and so end the gossip which, to his Highness\u2019s annoyance, had arisen concerning a prisoner in Zenda, and had given his visitors the trouble of this enquiry. The visitors, baffled, would retire, and Michael could, at his leisure, dispose of the body of the King.", "1167": "Sapt, Fritz, and I in my bed, looked round on one another in horror and bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan. Whether I went in peace or in war, openly at the head of a corps, or secretly by a stealthy assault, the King would be dead before I could come near him. If Michael were stronger and overcame my party, there would be an end. But if I were stronger, I should have no way to punish him, no means of proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also. On the other hand, I should be left as King (ah! for a moment my pulse quickened) and it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and me. He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible. At the worst, he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path\u2014with but one man between him and the throne, and that man an impostor; at best, there would be none left to stand against him. I had begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting to his friends; but now I acknowledged that the brains, if not the arms, of the conspiracy were his.", "1168": "\u201cDoes the King know this?\u201d I asked.", "1169": "\u201cI and my brother,\u201d answered Johann, \u201cput up the pipe, under the orders of my Lord of Hentzau. He was on guard that day, and the King asked my lord what it meant. \u2018Faith,\u2019 he answered, with his airy laugh, \u2018it\u2019s a new improvement on the ladder of Jacob, whereby, as you have read, sire, men pass from the earth to heaven. We thought it not meet that your Majesty should go, in case, sire, you must go, by the common route. So we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar cannot stare at you or incommode your passage. That, sire, is the meaning of that pipe.\u2019 And he laughed and bowed, and prayed the King\u2019s leave to replenish the King\u2019s glass\u2014for the King was at supper. And the King, though he is a brave man, as are all of his House, grew red and then white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him. Ah, sir\u201d (and the fellow shuddered), \u201cit is not easy to sleep quiet in the Castle of Zenda, for all of them would as soon cut a man\u2019s throat as play a game at cards; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for a pastime than any other\u2014ay, sooner than he would ruin a woman, though that he loves also.\u201d", "1170": "The man ceased, and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully guarded; and, turning to him, I added:", "1171": "\u201cIf anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda, you may answer \u2018Yes.\u2019 But if any asks who the prisoner is, do not answer. For all my promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as to the prisoner of Zenda. I\u2019ll kill you like a dog if the thing be so much as breathed within the house!\u201d", "1172": "Then, when he was gone, I looked at Sapt.", "1173": "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard nut!\u201d said I.", "1174": "\u201cSo hard,\u201d said he, shaking his grizzled head, \u201cthat as I think, this time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania!\u201d and he broke out into curses on Michael\u2019s cunning.", "1175": "I lay back on my pillows.", "1176": "\u201cThere seems to me,\u201d I observed, \u201cto be two ways by which the King can come out of Zenda alive. One is by treachery in the duke\u2019s followers.\u201d", "1177": "\u201cYou can leave that out,\u201d said Sapt.", "1178": "\u201cI hope not,\u201d I rejoined, \u201cbecause the other I was about to mention is\u2014by a miracle from heaven!\u201d", "1179": "It would have surprised the good people of Ruritania to know of the foregoing talk; for, according to the official reports, I had suffered a grievous and dangerous hurt from an accidental spear-thrust, received in the course of my sport. I caused the bulletins to be of a very serious character, and created great public excitement, whereby three things occurred: first, I gravely offended the medical faculty of Strelsau by refusing to summon to my bedside any of them, save a young man, a friend of Fritz\u2019s, whom we could trust; secondly, I received word from Marshal Strakencz that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his, and that the Princess Flavia was leaving for Tarlenheim under his unwilling escort (news whereat I strove not to be glad and proud); and thirdly, my brother, the Duke of Strelsau, although too well informed to believe the account of the origin of my sickness, was yet persuaded by the reports and by my seeming inactivity that I was in truth incapable of action, and that my life was in some danger. This I learnt from the man Johann, whom I was compelled to trust and send back to Zenda, where, by the way, Rupert Hentzau had him soundly flogged for daring to smirch the morals of Zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love. This, from Rupert, Johann deeply resented, and the duke\u2019s approval of it did more to bind the keeper to my side than all my promises.", "1180": "On Flavia\u2019s arrival I cannot dwell. Her joy at finding me up and well, instead of on my back and fighting with death, makes a picture that even now dances before my eyes till they grow too dim to see it; and her reproaches that I had not trusted even her must excuse the means I took to quiet them. In truth, to have her with me once more was like a taste of heaven to a damned soul, the sweeter for the inevitable doom that was to follow; and I rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with her. And when I had wasted two days, the Duke of Strelsau arranged a hunting-party.", "1181": "The stroke was near now. For Sapt and I, after anxious consultations, had resolved that we must risk a blow, our resolution being clinched by Johann\u2019s news that the King grew peaked, pale, and ill, and that his health was breaking down under his rigorous confinement. Now a man\u2014be he king or no king\u2014may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman, from bullet or thrust, as rot his life out in a cellar! That thought made prompt action advisable in the interests of the King; from my own point of view, it grew more and more necessary. For Strakencz urged on me the need of a speedy marriage, and my own inclinations seconded him with such terrible insistence that I feared for my resolution. I do not believe that I should have done the deed I dreamt of; but I might have come to flight, and my flight would have ruined the cause. And\u2014yes, I am no saint (ask my little sister-in-law), and worse still might have happened.", "1182": "It is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of a country that the King\u2019s brother and the King\u2019s personator, in a time of profound outward peace, near a placid, undisturbed country town, under semblance of amity, should wage a desperate war for the person and life of the King. Yet such was the struggle that began now between Zenda and Tarlenheim. When I look back on the time, I seem to myself to have been half mad. Sapt has told me that I suffered no interference and listened to no remonstrances; and if ever a King of Ruritania ruled like a despot, I was, in those days, the man. Look where I would, I saw nothing that made life sweet to me, and I took my life in my hand and carried it carelessly as a man dangles an old glove. At first they strove to guard me, to keep me safe, to persuade me not to expose myself; but when they saw how I was set, there grew up among them\u2014whether they knew the truth or not\u2014a feeling that Fate ruled the issue, and that I must be left to play my game with Michael my own way.", "1183": "Late next night I rose from table, where Flavia had sat by me, and conducted her to the door of her apartments. There I kissed her hand, and bade her sleep sound and wake to happy days. Then I changed my clothes and went out. Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me with six men and the horses. Over his saddle Sapt carried a long coil of rope, and both were heavily armed. I had with me a short stout cudgel and a long knife. Making a circuit, we avoided the town, and in an hour found ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the Castle of Zenda. The night was dark and very stormy; gusts of wind and spits of rain caught us as we breasted the incline, and the great trees moaned and sighed. When we came to a thick clump, about a quarter of a mile from the Castle, we bade our six friends hide there with the horses. Sapt had a whistle, and they could rejoin us in a few moments if danger came: but, up to now, we had met no one. I hoped that Michael was still off his guard, believing me to be safe in bed. However that might be, we gained the top of the hill without accident, and found ourselves on the edge of the moat where it sweeps under the road, separating the Old Castle from it. A tree stood on the edge of the bank, and Sapt, silently and diligently, set to make fast the rope. I stripped off my boots, took a pull at a flask of brandy, loosened the knife in its sheath, and took the cudgel between my teeth. Then I shook hands with my friends, not heeding a last look of entreaty from Fritz, and laid hold of the rope. I was going to have a look at \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d", "1184": "Gently I lowered myself into the water. Though the night was wild, the day had been warm and bright, and the water was not cold. I struck out, and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me. I could see only three yards ahead; I had then good hopes of not being seen, as I crept along close under the damp, moss-grown masonry. There were lights from the new part of the Castle on the other side, and now and again I heard laughter and merry shouts. I fancied I recognized young Rupert Hentzau\u2019s ringing tones, and pictured him flushed with wine. Recalling my thoughts to the business in hand, I rested a moment. If Johann\u2019s description were right, I must be near the window now. Very slowly I moved; and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape. It was the pipe, curving from the window to the water: about four feet of its surface were displayed; it was as big round as two men. I was about to approach it, when I saw something else, and my heart stood still. The nose of a boat protruded beyond the pipe on the other side; and listening intently, I heard a slight shuffle\u2014as of a man shifting his position. Who was the man who guarded Michael\u2019s invention? Was he awake or was he asleep? I felt if my knife were ready, and trod water; as I did so, I found bottom under my feet. The foundations of the Castle extended some fifteen inches, making a ledge; and I stood on it, out of water from my armpits upwards. Then I crouched and peered through the darkness under the pipe, where, curving, it left a space.", "1185": "There was a man in the boat. A rifle lay by him\u2014I saw the gleam of the barrel. Here was the sentinel! He sat very still. I listened; he breathed heavily, regularly, monotonously. By heaven, he slept! Kneeling on the shelf, I drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two feet of his. He was a big man, I saw. It was Max Holf, the brother of Johann. My hand stole to my belt, and I drew out my knife. Of all the deeds of my life, I love the least to think of this, and whether it were the act of a man or a traitor I will not ask. I said to myself: \u201cIt is war\u2014and the King\u2019s life is the stake.\u201d And I raised myself from beneath the pipe and stood up by the boat, which lay moored by the ledge. Holding my breath, I marked the spot and raised my arm. The great fellow stirred. He opened his eyes\u2014wide, wider. He gasped in terror at my face and clutched at his rifle. I struck home. And I heard the chorus of a love-song from the opposite bank.", "1186": "Leaving him where he lay, a huddled mass, I turned to \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d My time was short. This fellow\u2019s turn of watching might be over directly, and relief would come. Leaning over the pipe, I examined it, from the end near the water to the topmost extremity where it passed, or seemed to pass, through the masonry of the wall. There was no break in it, no chink. Dropping on my knees, I tested the under side. And my breath went quick and fast, for on this lower side, where the pipe should have clung close to the masonry, there was a gleam of light! That light must come from the cell of the King! I set my shoulder against the pipe and exerted my strength. The chink widened a very, very little, and hastily I desisted; I had done enough to show that the pipe was not fixed in the masonry at the lower side.", "1187": "Then I heard a voice\u2014a harsh, grating voice:", "1188": "\u201cWell, sire, if you have had enough of my society, I will leave you to repose; but I must fasten the little ornaments first.\u201d", "1189": "It was Detchard! I caught the English accent in a moment.", "1190": "\u201cHave you anything to ask, sire, before we part?\u201d", "1191": "The King\u2019s voice followed. It was his, though it was faint and hollow\u2014different from the merry tones I had heard in the glades of the forest.", "1192": "\u201cPray my brother,\u201d said the King, \u201cto kill me. I am dying by inches here.\u201d", "1193": "\u201cThe duke does not desire your death, sire\u2014yet,\u201d sneered Detchard; \u201cwhen he does behold your path to heaven!\u201d", "1194": "The King answered:", "1195": "\u201cSo be it! And now, if your orders allow it, pray leave me.\u201d", "1196": "\u201cMay you dream of paradise!\u201d said the ruffian.", "1197": "The light disappeared. I heard the bolts of the door run home. And then I heard the sobs of the King. He was alone, as he thought. Who dares mock at him?", "1198": "I did not venture to speak to him. The risk of some exclamation escaping him in surprise was too great. I dared do nothing that night; and my task now was to get myself away in safety, and to carry off the carcass of the dead man. To leave him there would tell too much. Casting loose the boat, I got in. The wind was blowing a gale now, and there was little danger of oars being heard. I rowed swiftly round to where my friends waited. I had just reached the spot, when a loud whistle sounded over the moat behind me.", "1199": "\u201cHullo, Max!\u201d I heard shouted.", "1200": "I hailed Sapt in a low tone. The rope came down. I tied it round the corpse, and then went up it myself.", "1201": "\u201cWhistle you too,\u201d I whispered, \u201cfor our men, and haul in the line. No talk now.\u201d", "1202": "They hauled up the body. Just as it reached the road, three men on horseback swept round from the front of the Castle. We saw them; but, being on foot ourselves, we escaped their notice. But we heard our men coming up with a shout.", "1203": "\u201cThe devil, but it\u2019s dark!\u201d cried a ringing voice.", "1204": "It was young Rupert. A moment later, shots rang out. Our people had met them. I started forward at a run, Sapt and Fritz following me.", "1205": "\u201cThrust, thrust!\u201d cried Rupert again, and a loud groan following told that he himself was not behind-hand.", "1206": "\u201cI\u2019m done, Rupert!\u201d cried a voice. \u201cThey\u2019re three to one. Save yourself!\u201d", "1207": "I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand. Suddenly a horse came towards me. A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.", "1208": "\u201cAre you cooked too, Krafstein?\u201d he cried.", "1209": "There was no answer.", "1210": "I sprang to the horse\u2019s head. It was Rupert Hentzau.", "1211": "\u201cAt last!\u201d I cried.", "1212": "For we seemed to have him. He had only his sword in his hand. My men were hot upon him; Sapt and Fritz were running up. I had outstripped them; but if they got close enough to fire, he must die or surrender.", "1213": "\u201cAt last!\u201d I cried.", "1214": "\u201cIt\u2019s the play-actor!\u201d cried he, slashing at my cudgel. He cut it clean in two; and, judging discretion better than death, I ducked my head and (I blush to tell it) scampered for my life. The devil was in Rupert Hentzau; for he put spurs to his horse, and I, turning to look, saw him ride, full gallop, to the edge of the moat and leap in, while the shots of our party fell thick round him like hail. With one gleam of moonlight we should have riddled him with balls; but, in the darkness, he won to the corner of the Castle, and vanished from our sight.", "1215": "\u201cThe deuce take him!\u201d grinned Sapt.", "1216": "\u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d said I, \u201cthat he\u2019s a villain. Whom have we got?\u201d", "1217": "We had Lauengram and Krafstein: they lay dead; and, concealment being no longer possible, we flung them, with Max, into the moat; and, drawing together in a compact body, rode off down the hill. And, in our midst, went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen. Thus we travelled home, heavy at heart for the death of our friends, sore uneasy concerning the King, and cut to the quick that young Rupert had played yet another winning hand with us.", "1218": "For my own part, I was vexed and angry that I had killed no man in open fight, but only stabbed a knave in his sleep. And I did not love to hear Rupert call me a play-actor.", "1219": "Ruritania is not England, or the quarrel between Duke Michael and myself could not have gone on, with the extraordinary incidents which marked it, without more public notice being directed to it. Duels were frequent among all the upper classes, and private quarrels between great men kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents. Nevertheless, after the affray which I have just related, such reports began to circulate that I felt it necessary to be on my guard. The death of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives. I issued a stern order, declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented licence (the Chancellor drew up the document for me, and very well he did it), and forbidding it save in the gravest cases. I sent a public and stately apology to Michael, and he returned a deferential and courteous reply to me; for our one point of union was\u2014and it underlay all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our actions\u2014that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the table. He, as well as I, was a \u201cplay-actor\u201d, and, hating one another, we combined to dupe public opinion. Unfortunately, however, the necessity for concealment involved the necessity of delay: the King might die in his prison, or even be spirited off somewhere else; it could not be helped. For a little while I was compelled to observe a truce, and my only consolation was that Flavia most warmly approved of my edict against duelling, and, when I expressed delight at having won her favour, prayed me, if her favour were any motive to me, to prohibit the practice altogether.", "1220": "\u201cWait till we are married,\u201d said I, smiling.", "1221": "Not the least peculiar result of the truce and of the secrecy which dictated it was that the town of Zenda became in the day-time\u2014I would not have trusted far to its protection by night\u2014a sort of neutral zone, where both parties could safely go; and I, riding down one day with Flavia and Sapt, had an encounter with an acquaintance, which presented a ludicrous side, but was at the same time embarrassing. As I rode along, I met a dignified looking person driving in a two-horsed carriage. He stopped his horses, got out, and approached me, bowing low. I recognized the Head of the Strelsau Police.", "1222": "\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s ordinance as to duelling is receiving our best attention,\u201d he assured me.", "1223": "If the best attention involved his presence in Zenda, I determined at once to dispense with it.", "1224": "\u201cIs that what brings you to Zenda, Prefect?\u201d I asked.", "1225": "\u201cWhy no, sire; I am here because I desired to oblige the British Ambassador.\u201d", "1226": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the British Ambassador doing dans cette galere?\u201d said I, carelessly.", "1227": "\u201cA young countryman of his, sire\u2014a man of some position\u2014is missing.

I marked the effect on the garrison of Zenda: they ceased to be seen abroad; and any of my men who went near the Castle reported that the utmost vigilance prevailed there. Touched as I was by Madame de Mauban\u2019s appeal, I seemed as powerless to befriend her as I had proved to help the King. Michael bade me defiance; and although he too had been seen outside the walls, with more disregard for appearances than he had hitherto shown, he did not take the trouble to send any excuse for his failure to wait on the King. Time ran on in inactivity, when every moment was pressing; for not only was I faced with the new danger which the stir about my disappearance brought on me, but great murmurs had arisen in Strelsau at my continued absence from the city. They had been greater, but for the knowledge that Flavia was with me; and for this reason I suffered her to stay, though I hated to have her where danger was, and though every day of our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost to breaking. As a final blow, nothing would content my advisers, Strakencz and the Chancellor (who came out from Strelsau to make an urgent representation to me), save that I should appoint a day for the public solemnization of my betrothal, a ceremony which in Ruritania is well nigh as binding and great a thing as the marriage itself. And this\u2014with Flavia sitting by me\u2014I was forced to do, setting a date a fortnight ahead, and appointing the Cathedral in Strelsau as the place. And this formal act being published far and wide, caused great joy throughout the kingdom, and was the talk of all tongues; so that I reckoned there were but two men who chafed at it\u2014I mean Black Michael and myself; and but one who did not know of it\u2014that one the man whose name I bore, the King of Ruritania.", "1323": "In truth, I heard something of the way the news was received in the Castle; for after an interval of three days, the man Johann, greedy for more money, though fearful for his life, again found means to visit us. He had been waiting on the duke when the tidings came. Black Michael\u2019s face had grown blacker still, and he had sworn savagely; nor was he better pleased when young Rupert took oath that I meant to do as I said, and turning to Madame de Mauban, wished her joy on a rival gone. Michael\u2019s hand stole towards his sword (said Johann), but not a bit did Rupert care; for he rallied the duke on having made a better King than had reigned for years past in Ruritania. \u201cAnd,\u201d said he, with a meaning bow to his exasperated master, \u201cthe devil sends the princess a finer man than heaven had marked out for her, by my soul, it does!\u201d Then Michael harshly bade him hold his tongue, and leave them; but Rupert must needs first kiss madame\u2019s hand, which he did as though he loved her, while Michael glared at him.", "1324": "This was the lighter side of the fellow\u2019s news; but more serious came behind, and it was plain that if time pressed at Tarlenheim, it pressed none the less fiercely at Zenda. For the King was very sick: Johann had seen him, and he was wasted and hardly able to move. \u201cThere could be no thought of taking another for him now.\u201d So alarmed were they, that they had sent for a physician from Strelsau; and the physician having been introduced into the King\u2019s cell, had come forth pale and trembling, and urgently prayed the duke to let him go back and meddle no more in the affair; but the duke would not, and held him there a prisoner, telling him his life was safe if the King lived while the duke desired and died when the duke desired\u2014not otherwise. And, persuaded by the physician, they had allowed Madame de Mauban to visit the King and give him such attendance as his state needed, and as only a woman can give. Yet his life hung in the balance; and I was still strong and whole and free. Wherefore great gloom reigned at Zenda; and save when they quarrelled, to which they were very prone, they hardly spoke. But the deeper the depression of the rest, young Rupert went about Satan\u2019s work with a smile in his eye and a song on his lip; and laughed \u201cfit to burst\u201d (said Johann) because the duke always set Detchard to guard the King when Madame de Mauban was in the cell\u2014which precaution was, indeed, not unwise in my careful brother. Thus Johann told his tale and seized his crowns. Yet he besought us to allow him to stay with us in Tarlenheim, and not venture his head again in the lion\u2019s den; but we had need of him there, and, although I refused to constrain him, I prevailed on him by increased rewards to go back and carry tidings to Madame de Mauban that I was working for her, and that, if she could, she should speak one word of comfort to the King. For while suspense is bad for the sick, yet despair is worse still, and it might be that the King lay dying of mere hopelessness, for I could learn of no definite disease that afflicted him.", "1325": "\u201cAnd how do they guard the King now?\u201d I asked, remembering that two of the Six were dead, and Max Holf also.", "1326": "\u201cDetchard and Bersonin watch by night, Rupert Hentzau and De Gautet by day, sir,\u201d he answered.", "1327": "\u201cOnly two at a time?\u201d", "1328": "\u201cAy, sir; but the others rest in a room just above, and are within sound of a cry or a whistle.\u201d", "1329": "\u201cA room just above?

A strong party under Sapt\u2019s command was to steal up to the door of the chateau. If discovered prematurely, they were to kill anyone who found them\u2014with their swords, for I wanted no noise of firing. If all went well, they would be at the door when Johann opened it. They were to rush in and secure the servants if their mere presence and the use of the King\u2019s name were not enough. At the same moment\u2014and on this hinged the plan\u2014a woman\u2019s cry was to ring out loud and shrill from Antoinette de Mauban\u2019s chamber. Again and again she was to cry: \u201cHelp, help! Michael, help!\u201d and then to utter the name of young Rupert Hentzau. Then, as we hoped, Michael, in fury, would rush out of his apartments opposite, and fall alive into the hands of Sapt. Still the cries would go on; and my men would let down the drawbridge; and it would be strange if Rupert, hearing his name thus taken in vain, did not descend from where he slept and seek to cross. De Gautet might or might not come with him: that must be left to chance.", "1383": "And when Rupert set his foot on the drawbridge? There was my part: for I was minded for another swim in the moat; and, lest I should grow weary, I had resolved to take with me a small wooden ladder, on which I could rest my arms in the water\u2014and my feet when I left it. I would rear it against the wall just by the bridge; and when the bridge was across, I would stealthily creep on to it\u2014and then if Rupert or De Gautet crossed in safety, it would be my misfortune, not my fault. They dead, two men only would remain; and for them we must trust to the confusion we had created and to a sudden rush. We should have the keys of the door that led to the all-important rooms. Perhaps they would rush out. If they stood by their orders, then the King\u2019s life hung on the swiftness with which we could force the outer door; and I thanked God that not Rupert Hentzau watched, but Detchard. For though Detchard was a cool man, relentless, and no coward, he had neither the dash nor the recklessness of Rupert. Moreover, he, if any one of them, really loved Black Michael, and it might be that he would leave Bersonin to guard the King, and rush across the bridge to take part in the affray on the other side.", "1384": "So I planned\u2014desperately. And, that our enemy might be the better lulled to security, I gave orders that our residence should be brilliantly lighted from top to bottom, as though we were engaged in revelry; and should so be kept all night, with music playing and people moving to and fro. Strakencz would be there, and he was to conceal our departure, if he could, from Flavia. And if we came not again by the morning, he was to march, openly and in force to the Castle, and demand the person of the King; if Black Michael were not there, as I did not think he would be, the Marshal would take Flavia with him, as swiftly as he could, to Strelsau, and there proclaim Black Michael\u2019s treachery and the probable death of the King, and rally all that there was honest and true round the banner of the princess. And, to say truth, this was what I thought most likely to happen. For I had great doubts whether either the King or Black Michael or I had more than a day to live. Well, if Black Michael died, and if I, the play-actor, slew Rupert Hentzau with my own hand, and then died myself, it might be that Fate would deal as lightly with Ruritania as could be hoped, notwithstanding that she demanded the life of the King\u2014and to her dealing thus with me, I was in no temper to make objection.", "1385": "It was late when we rose from conference, and I betook me to the princess\u2019s apartments. She was pensive that evening; yet, when I left her, she flung her arms about me and grew, for an instant, bashfully radiant as she slipped a ring on my finger. I was wearing the King\u2019s ring; but I had also on my little finger a plain band of gold engraved with the motto of our family: \u201cNil Quae Feci.\u201d This I took off and put on her, and signed to her to let me go. And she, understanding, stood away and watched me with dimmed eyes.", "1386": "\u201cWear that ring, even though you wear another when you are queen,\u201d I said.", "1387": "\u201cWhatever else I wear, this I will wear till I die and after,\u201d said she, as she kissed the ring.", "1388": "The night came fine and clear. I had prayed for dirty weather, such as had favoured my previous voyage in the moat, but Fortune was this time against me. Still I reckoned that by keeping close under the wall and in the shadow I could escape detection from the windows of the chateau that looked out on the scene of my efforts. If they searched the moat, indeed, my scheme must fail; but I did not think they would. They had made \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d secure against attack. Johann had himself helped to fix it closely to the masonry on the under side, so that it could not now be moved from below any more than from above. An assault with explosives or a long battering with picks alone could displace it, and the noise involved in either of these operations put them out of the question. What harm, then, could a man do in the moat? I trusted that Black Michael, putting this query to himself, would answer confidently, \u201cNone;\u201d while, even if Johann meant treachery, he did not know my scheme, and would doubtless expect to see me, at the head of my friends, before the front entrance to the chateau. There, I said to Sapt, was the real danger. \u201cAnd there,\u201d I added, \u201cyou shall be. Doesn\u2019t that content you?\u201d", "1389": "But it did not. Dearly would he have liked to come with me, had I not utterly refused to take him. One man might escape notice, to double the party more than doubled the risk; and when he ventured to hint once again that my life was too valuable, I, knowing the secret thought he clung to, sternly bade him be silent, assuring him that unless the King lived through the night, I would not live through it either.", "1390": "At twelve o\u2019clock, Sapt\u2019s command left the chateau of Tarlenheim and struck off to the right, riding by unfrequented roads, and avoiding the town of Zenda. If all went well, they would be in front of the Castle by about a quarter to two. Leaving their horses half a mile off, they were to steal up to the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the opening of the door. If the door were not opened by two, they were to send Fritz von Tarlenheim round to the other side of the Castle. I would meet him there if I were alive, and we would consult whether to storm the Castle or not. If I were not there, they were to return with all speed to Tarlenheim, rouse the Marshal, and march in force to Zenda. For if not there, I should be dead; and I knew that the King would not be alive five minutes after I ceased to breathe. I must now leave Sapt and his friends, and relate how I myself proceeded on this eventful night. I went out on the good horse which had carried me, on the night of the coronation, back from the hunting-lodge to Strelsau. I carried a revolver in the saddle and my sword. I was covered with a large cloak, and under this I wore a warm, tight-fitting woollen jersey, a pair of knickerbockers, thick stockings, and light canvas shoes. I had rubbed myself thoroughly with oil, and I carried a large flask of whisky. The night was warm, but I might probably be immersed a long while, and it was necessary to take every precaution against cold: for cold not only saps a man\u2019s courage if he has to die, but impairs his energy if others have to die, and, finally, gives him rheumatics, if it be God\u2019s will that he lives. Also I tied round my body a length of thin but stout cord, and I did not forget my ladder. I, starting after Sapt, took a shorter route, skirting the town to the left, and found myself in the outskirts of the forest at about half-past twelve. I tied my horse up in a thick clump of trees, leaving the revolver in its pocket in the saddle\u2014it would be no use to me\u2014and, ladder in hand, made my way to the edge of the moat. Here I unwound my rope from about my waist, bound it securely round the trunk of a tree on the bank, and let myself down. The Castle clock struck a quarter to one as I felt the water under me and began to swim round the keep, pushing the ladder before me, and hugging the Castle wall. Thus voyaging, I came to my old friend, \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder,\u201d and felt the ledge of the masonry under me. I crouched down in the shadow of the great pipe\u2014I tried to stir it, but it was quite immovable\u2014and waited. I remember that my predominant feeling was neither anxiety for the King nor longing for Flavia, but an intense desire to smoke; and this craving, of course, I could not gratify.", "1391": "The drawbridge was still in its place. I saw its airy, slight framework above me, some ten yards to my right, as I crouched with my back against the wall of the King\u2019s cell. I made out a window two yards my side of it and nearly on the same level. That, if Johann spoke true, must belong to the duke\u2019s apartments; and on the other side, in about the same relative position, must be Madame de Mauban\u2019s window. Women are careless, forgetful creatures. I prayed that she might not forget that she was to be the victim of a brutal attempt at two o\u2019clock precisely. I was rather amused at the part I had assigned to my young friend Rupert Hentzau; but I owed him a stroke\u2014for, even as I sat, my shoulder ached where he had, with an audacity that seemed half to hide his treachery, struck at me, in the sight of all my friends, on the terrace at Tarlenheim.", "1392": "Suddenly the duke\u2019s window grew bright. The shutters were not closed, and the interior became partially visible to me as I cautiously raised myself till I stood on tiptoe. Thus placed, my range of sight embraced a yard or more inside the window, while the radius of light did not reach me. The window was flung open and someone looked out. I marked Antoinette de Mauban\u2019s graceful figure, and, though her face was in shadow, the fine outline of her head was revealed against the light behind. I longed to cry softly, \u201cRemember!\u201d but I dared not\u2014and happily, for a moment later a man came up and stood by her. He tried to put his arm round her waist, but with a swift motion she sprang away and leant against the shutter, her profile towards me. I made out who the newcomer was: it was young Rupert. A low laugh from him made me sure, as he leant forward, stretching out his hand towards her.", "1393": "\u201cGently, gently!\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re too soon, my boy!\u201d", "1394": "His head was close to hers. I suppose he whispered to her, for I saw her point to the moat, and I heard her say, in slow and distinct tones:", "1395": "\u201cI had rather throw myself out of this window!\u201d", "1396": "He came close up to the window and looked out.", "1397": "\u201cIt looks cold,\u201d said he. \u201cCome, Antoinette, are you serious?\u201d", "1398": "She made no answer so far as I heard; and he, smiting his hand petulantly on the window-sill, went on, in the voice of some spoilt child:", "1399": "\u201cHang Black Michael! Isn\u2019t the princess enough for him? Is he to have everything? What the devil do you see in Black Michael?\u201d", "1400": "\u201cIf I told him what you say\u2014\u201d she began.", "1401": "\u201cWell, tell him,\u201d said Rupert, carelessly; and, catching her off her guard, he sprang forward and kissed her, laughing, and crying, \u201cThere\u2019s something to tell him!\u201d", "1402": "If I had kept my revolver with me, I should have been very sorely tempted. Being spared the temptation, I merely added this new score to his account.", "1403": "\u201cThough, faith,\u201d said Rupert, \u201cit\u2019s little he cares. He\u2019s mad about the princess, you know. He talks of nothing but cutting the play-actor\u2019s throat.\u201d", "1404": "Didn\u2019t he, indeed?", "1405": "\u201cAnd if I do it for him, what do you think he\u2019s promised me?\u201d", "1406": "The unhappy woman raised her hands above her head, in prayer or in despair.", "1407": "\u201cBut I detest waiting,\u201d said Rupert; and I saw that he was about to lay his hand on her again, when there was a noise of a door in the room opening, and a harsh voice cried:", "1408": "\u201cWhat are you doing here, sir?\u201d", "1409": "Rupert turned his back to the window, bowed low, and said, in his loud, merry tones: \u201cApologizing for your absence, sir. Could I leave the lady alone?\u201d", "1410": "The newcomer must be Black Michael. I saw him directly, as he advanced towards the window. He caught young Rupert by the arm.", "1411": "\u201cThe moat would hold more than the King!\u201d said he, with a significant gesture.", "1412": "\u201cDoes your Highness threaten me?\u201d asked Rupert.", "1413": "\u201cA threat is more warning than most men get from me.\u201d", "1414": "\u201cYet,\u201d observed Rupert, \u201cRudolf Rassendyll has been much threatened, and yet lives!\u201d", "1415": "\u201cAm I in fault because my servants bungle?\u201d asked Michael scornfully.", "1416": "\u201cYour Highness has run no risk of bungling!\u201d sneered Rupert.", "1417": "It was telling the duke that he shirked danger as plain as ever I have heard a man told. Black Michael had self-control. I dare say he scowled\u2014it was a great regret to me that I could not see their faces better\u2014but his voice was even and calm, as he answered:", "1418": "\u201cEnough, enough! We mustn\u2019t quarrel, Rupert. Are Detchard and Bersonin at their posts?\u201d", "1419": "\u201cThey are, sir.\u201d", "1420": "\u201cI need you no more.\u201d", "1421": "\u201cNay, I\u2019m not oppressed with fatigue,\u201d said Rupert.", "1422": "\u201cPray, sir, leave us,\u201d said Michael, more impatiently. \u201cIn ten minutes the drawbridge will be drawn back, and I presume you have no wish to swim to your bed.\u201d", "1423": "Rupert\u2019s figure disappeared. I heard the door open and shut again. Michael and Antoinette de Mauban were left together. To my chagrin, the duke laid his hand on the window and closed it. He stood talking to Antoinette for a moment or two. She shook her head, and he turned impatiently away. She left the window. The door sounded again, and Black Michael closed the shutters.", "1424": "\u201cDe Gautet, De Gautet, man!\u201d sounded from the drawbridge. \u201cUnless you want a bath before your bed, come along!\u201d", "1425": "It was Rupert\u2019s voice, coming from the end of the drawbridge. A moment later he and De Gautet stepped out on the bridge. Rupert\u2019s arm was through De Gautet\u2019s, and in the middle of the bridge he detained his companion and leant over. I dropped behind the shelter of \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d", "1426": "Then Master Rupert had a little sport. He took from De Gautet a bottle which he carried, and put it to his lips.", "1427": "\u201cHardly a drop!\u201d he cried discontentedly, and flung it in the moat.", "1428": "It fell, as I judged from the sound and the circles on the water, within a yard of the pipe. And Rupert, taking out his revolver, began to shoot at it. The first two shots missed the bottle, but hit the pipe. The third shattered the bottle. I hoped that the young ruffian would be content; but he emptied the other barrels at the pipe, and one, skimming over the pipe, whistled through my hair as I crouched on the other side.", "1429": "\u201c\u2018Ware bridge!\u201d a voice cried, to my relief.", "1430": "Rupert and De Gautet cried, \u201cA moment!\u201d and ran across. The bridge was drawn back, and all became still. The clock struck a quarter-past one. I rose and stretched myself and yawned.", "1431": "I think some ten minutes had passed when I heard a slight noise to my right. I peered over the pipe, and saw a dark figure standing in the gateway that led to the bridge. It was a man. By the careless, graceful poise, I guessed it to be Rupert again. He held a sword in his hand, and he stood motionless for a minute or two. Wild thoughts ran through me. On what mischief was the young fiend bent now? Then he laughed low to himself; then he turned his face to the wall, took a step in my direction, and, to my surprise, began to climb down the wall. In an instant I saw that there must be steps in the wall; it was plain. They were cut into or affixed to the wall, at intervals of about eighteen inches. Rupert set his foot on the lower one. Then he placed his sword between his teeth, turned round, and noiselessly let himself into the water. Had it been a matter of my life only, I would have swum to meet him. Dearly would I have loved to fight it out with him then and there\u2014with steel, on a fine night, and none to come between us. But there was the King! I restrained myself, but I could not bridle my swift breathing, and I watched him with the intensest eagerness.", "1432": "He swam leisurely and quietly across. There were more steps up on the other side, and he climbed them. When he set foot in the gateway, standing on the drawn-back bridge, he felt in his pocket and took something out. I heard him unlock the door. I could hear no noise of its closing behind him. He vanished from my sight.", "1433": "Abandoning my ladder\u2014I saw I did not need it now\u2014I swam to the side of the bridge and climbed half way up the steps. There I hung with my sword in my hand, listening eagerly. The duke\u2019s room was shuttered and dark. There was a light in the window on the opposite side of the bridge. Not a sound broke the silence, till half-past one chimed from the great clock in the tower of the chateau.", "1434": "There were other plots than mine afoot in the Castle that night.", "1435": "The position wherein I stood does not appear very favourable to thought; yet for the next moment or two I thought profoundly. I had, I told myself, scored one point. Be Rupert Hentzau\u2019s errand what it might, and the villainy he was engaged on what it would, I had scored one point. He was on the other side of the moat from the King, and it would be by no fault of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again. I had three left to deal with: two on guard and De Gautet in his bed. Ah, if I had the keys! I would have risked everything and attacked Detchard and Bersonin before their friends could join them. But I was powerless. I must wait till the coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the bridge\u2014someone with the keys. And I waited, as it seemed, for half an hour, really for about five minutes, before the next act in the rapid drama began.", "1436": "All was still on the other side. The duke\u2019s room remained inscrutable behind its shutters. The light burnt steadily in Madame de Mauban\u2019s window. Then I heard the faintest, faintest sound: it came from behind the door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat. It but just reached my ear, yet I could not be mistaken as to what it was. It was made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly. Who was turning it? And of what room was it the key? There leapt before my eyes the picture of young Rupert, with the key in one hand, his sword in the other, and an evil smile on his face. But I did not know what door it was, nor on which of his favourite pursuits young Rupert was spending the hours of that night.", "1437": "I was soon to be enlightened, for the next moment\u2014before my friends could be near the chateau door\u2014before Johann the keeper would have thought to nerve himself for his task\u2014there was a sudden crash from the room with the lighted window. It sounded as though someone had flung down a lamp; and the window went dark and black. At the same instant a cry rang out, shrill in the night: \u201cHelp, help! Michael, help!\u201d and was followed by a shriek of utter terror.", "1438": "I was tingling in every nerve. I stood on the topmost step, clinging to the threshold of the gate with my right hand and holding my sword in my left. Suddenly I perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge; there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand. I darted across and stood there. Thus placed, I commanded the path, and no man could pass between the chateau and the old Castle till he had tried conclusions with me.", "1439": "There was another shriek. Then a door was flung open and clanged against the wall, and I heard the handle of a door savagely twisted.", "1440": "\u201cOpen the door! In God\u2019s name, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d cried a voice\u2014the voice of Black Michael himself.", "1441": "He was answered by the very words I had written in my letter.", "1442": "\u201cHelp, Michael\u2014Hentzau!\u201d", "1443": "A fierce oath rang out from the duke, and with a loud thud he threw himself against the door. At the same moment I heard a window above my head open, and a voice cried: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d and I heard a man\u2019s hasty footsteps. I grasped my sword. If De Gautet came my way, the Six would be less by one more.", "1444": "Then I heard the clash of crossed swords and a tramp of feet and\u2014I cannot tell the thing so quickly as it happened, for all seemed to come at once. There was an angry cry from madame\u2019s room, the cry of a wounded man; the window was flung open; young Rupert stood there sword in hand. He turned his back, and I saw his body go forward to the lunge.", "1445": "\u201cAh, Johann, there\u2019s one for you! Come on, Michael!\u201d", "1446": "Johann was there, then\u2014come to the rescue of the duke! How would he open the door for me? For I feared that Rupert had slain him.", "1447": "\u201cHelp!\u201d cried the duke\u2019s voice, faint and husky.", "1448": "I heard a step on the stairs above me; and I heard a stir down to my left, in the direction of the King\u2019s cell. But, before anything happened on my side of the moat, I saw five or six men round young Rupert in the embrasure of madame\u2019s window. Three or four times he lunged with incomparable dash and dexterity. For an instant they fell back, leaving a ring round him. He leapt on the parapet of the window, laughing as he leapt, and waving his sword in his hand. He was drunk with blood, and he laughed again wildly as he flung himself headlong into the moat.", "1449": "What became of him then? I did not see: for as he leapt, De Gautet\u2019s lean face looked out through the door by me, and, without a second\u2019s hesitation, I struck at him with all the strength God had given me, and he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan. I dropped on my knees by him. Where were the keys? I found myself muttering: \u201cThe keys, man, the keys?\u201d as though he had been yet alive and could listen; and when I could not find them, I\u2014God forgive me!\u2014I believe I struck a dead man\u2019s face.", "1450": "At last I had them. There were but three. Seizing the largest, I felt the lock of the door that led to the cell. I fitted in the key. It was right. The lock turned. I drew the door close behind me and locked it as noiselessly as I could, putting the key in my pocket.", "1451": "I found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs. An oil lamp burnt dimly in the bracket. I took it down and held it in my hand; and I stood and listened.", "1452": "\u201cWhat in the devil can it be?\u201d I heard a voice say.", "1453": "It came from behind a door that faced me at the bottom of the stairs.", "1454": "And another answered:", "1455": "\u201cShall we kill him?\u201d", "1456": "I strained to hear the answer, and could have sobbed with relief when Detchard\u2019s voice came grating and cold:", "1457": "\u201cWait a bit. There\u2019ll be trouble if we strike too soon.\u201d", "1458": "There was a moment\u2019s silence. Then I heard the bolt of the door cautiously drawn back. Instantly I put out the light I held, replacing the lamp in the bracket.", "1459": "\u201cIt\u2019s dark\u2014the lamp\u2019s out. Have you a light?\u201d said the other voice\u2014Bersonin\u2019s.", "1460": "No doubt they had a light, but they should not use it. It was come to the crisis now, and I rushed down the steps and flung myself against the door. Bersonin had unbolted it and it gave way before me. The Belgian stood there sword in hand, and Detchard was sitting on a couch at the side of the room. In astonishment at seeing me, Bersonin recoiled; Detchard jumped to his sword. I rushed madly at the Belgian: he gave way before me, and I drove him up against the wall. He was no swordsman, though he fought bravely, and in a moment he lay on the floor before me. I turned\u2014Detchard was not there. Faithful to his orders, he had not risked a fight with me, but had rushed straight to the door of the King\u2019s room, opened it and slammed it behind him. Even now he was at his work inside.", "1461": "And surely he would have killed the King, and perhaps me also, had it not been for one devoted man who gave his life for the King. For when I forced the door, the sight I saw was this: the King stood in the corner of the room: broken by his sickness, he could do nothing; his fettered hands moved uselessly up and down, and he was laughing horribly in half-mad delirium. Detchard and the doctor were together in the middle of the room; and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer, pinning his hands to his sides for an instant. Then Detchard wrenched himself free from the feeble grip, and, as I entered, drove his sword through the hapless man. Then he turned on me, crying:", "1462": "\u201cAt last!\u201d", "1463": "We were sword to sword. By blessed chance, neither he nor Bersonin had been wearing their revolvers. I found them afterwards, ready loaded, on the mantelpiece of the outer room: it was hard by the door, ready to their hands, but my sudden rush in had cut off access to them. Yes, we were man to man: and we began to fight, silently, sternly, and hard. Yet I remember little of it, save that the man was my match with the sword\u2014nay, and more, for he knew more tricks than I; and that he forced me back against the bars that guarded the entrance to \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d And I saw a smile on his face, and he wounded me in the left arm.", "1464": "No glory do I take for that contest. I believe that the man would have mastered me and slain me, and then done his butcher\u2019s work, for he was the most skilful swordsman I have ever met; but even as he pressed me hard, the half-mad, wasted, wan creature in the corner leapt high in lunatic mirth, shrieking:", "1465": "\u201cIt\u2019s cousin Rudolf! Cousin Rudolf! I\u2019ll help you, cousin Rudolf!\u201d and catching up a chair in his hands (he could but just lift it from the ground and hold it uselessly before him) he came towards us. Hope came to me. \u201cCome on!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome on! Drive it against his legs.\u201d", "1466": "Detchard replied with a savage thrust. He all but had me.", "1467": "\u201cCome on! Come on, man!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome and share the fun!\u201d", "1468": "And the King laughed gleefully, and came on, pushing his chair before him.", "1469": "With an oath Detchard skipped back, and, before I knew what he was doing, had turned his sword against the King. He made one fierce cut at the King, and the King, with a piteous cry, dropped where he stood. The stout ruffian turned to face me again. But his own hand had prepared his destruction: for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed from the dead physician. He slipped; he fell. Like a dart I was upon him. I caught him by the throat, and before he could recover himself I drove my point through his neck, and with a stifled curse he fell across the body of his victim.", "1470": "Was the King dead? It was my first thought. I rushed to where he lay. Ay, it seemed as if he were dead, for he had a great gash across his forehead, and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor. I dropped on my knees beside him, and leant my ear down to hear if he breathed. But before I could there was a loud rattle from the outside. I knew the sound: the drawbridge was being pushed out. A moment later it rang home against the wall on my side of the moat. I should be caught in a trap and the King with me, if he yet lived. He must take his chance, to live or die. I took my sword, and passed into the outer room. Who were pushing the drawbridge out\u2014my men? If so, all was well. My eye fell on the revolvers, and I seized one; and paused to listen in the doorway of the outer room. To listen, say I? Yes, and to get my breath: and I tore my shirt and twisted a strip of it round my bleeding arm; and stood listening again. I would have given the world to hear Sapt\u2019s voice. For I was faint, spent, and weary. And that wild-cat Rupert Hentzau was yet at large in the Castle. Yet, because I could better defend the narrow door at the top of the stairs than the wider entrance to the room, I dragged myself up the steps, and stood behind it listening.", "1471": "What was the sound? Again a strange one for the place and time. An easy, scornful, merry laugh\u2014the laugh of young Rupert Hentzau! I could scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh. Yet the laugh told me that my men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had come. And the clock struck half-past two! My God! The door had not been opened! They had gone to the bank! They had not found me! They had gone by now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the King\u2019s death\u2014and mine. Well, it would be true before they got there. Was not Rupert laughing in triumph?", "1472": "For a moment, I sank, unnerved, against the door. Then I started up alert again, for Rupert cried scornfully:", "1473": "\u201cWell, the bridge is there! Come over it! And in God\u2019s name, let\u2019s see Black Michael. Keep back, you curs! Michael, come and fight for her!\u201d", "1474": "If it were a three-cornered fight, I might yet bear my part. I turned the key in the door and looked out.", "1475": "For a moment I could see nothing, for the glare of lanterns and torches caught me full in the eyes from the other side of the bridge. But soon the scene grew clear: and it was a strange scene. The bridge was in its place. At the far end of it stood a group of the duke\u2019s servants; two or three carried the lights which had dazzled me, three or four held pikes in rest. They were huddled together; their weapons were protruded before them; their faces were pale and agitated. To put it plainly, they looked in as arrant a fright as I have seen men look, and they gazed apprehensively at a man who stood in the middle of the bridge, sword in hand. Rupert Hentzau was in his trousers and shirt; the white linen was stained with blood, but his easy, buoyant pose told me that he was himself either not touched at all or merely scratched. There he stood, holding the bridge against them, and daring them to come on; or, rather, bidding them send Black Michael to him; and they, having no firearms, cowered before the desperate man and dared not attack him. They whispered to one another; and in the backmost rank, I saw my friend Johann, leaning against the portal of the door and stanching with a handkerchief the blood which flowed from a wound in his cheek.", "1476": "By marvellous chance, I was master. The cravens would oppose me no more than they dared attack Rupert. I had but to raise my revolver, and I sent him to his account with his sins on his head. He did not so much as know that I was there. I did nothing\u2014why, I hardly know to this day. I had killed one man stealthily that night, and another by luck rather than skill\u2014perhaps it was that. Again, villain as the man was, I did not relish being one of a crowd against him\u2014perhaps it was that. But stronger than either of these restrained feelings came a curiosity and a fascination which held me spellbound, watching for the outcome of the scene.", "1477": "\u201cMichael, you dog! Michael! If you can stand, come on!\u201d cried Rupert; and he advanced a step, the group shrinking back a little before him. \u201cMichael, you bastard! Come on!\u201d", "1478": "The answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman:", "1479": "\u201cHe\u2019s dead! My God, he\u2019s dead!\u201d", "1480": "\u201cDead!\u201d shouted Rupert. \u201cI struck better than I knew!\u201d and he laughed triumphantly. Then he went on: \u201cDown with your weapons there! I\u2019m your master now! Down with them, I say!\u201d", "1481": "I believe they would have obeyed, but as he spoke came new things. First, there arose a distant sound, as of shouts and knockings from the other side of the chateau. My heart leapt. It must be my men, come by a happy disobedience to seek me. The noise continued, but none of the rest seemed to heed it. Their attention was chained by what now happened before their eyes. The group of servants parted and a woman staggered on to the bridge. Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her dark hair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches. In her shaking hand she held a revolver, and, as she tottered forward, she fired it at Rupert Hentzau. The ball missed him, and struck the woodwork over my head.", "1482": "\u201cFaith, madame,\u201d laughed Rupert, \u201chad your eyes been no more deadly than your shooting, I had not been in this scrape\u2014nor Black Michael in hell\u2014tonight!\u201d", "1483": "She took no notice of his words. With a wonderful effort, she calmed herself till she stood still and rigid. Then very slowly and deliberately she began to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim.", "1484": "He would be mad to risk it. He must rush on her, chancing the bullet, or retreat towards me. I covered him with my weapon.", "1485": "He did neither. Before she had got her aim, he bowed in his most graceful fashion, cried \u201cI can\u2019t kill where I\u2019ve kissed,\u201d and before she or I could stop him, laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge, and lightly leapt into the moat.", "1486": "At that very moment I heard a rush of feet, and a voice I knew\u2014Sapt\u2019s\u2014cry: \u201cGod! it\u2019s the duke\u2014dead!\u201d Then I knew that the King needed me no more, and throwing down my revolver, I sprang out on the bridge. There was a cry of wild wonder, \u201cThe King!\u201d and then I, like Rupert of Hentzau, sword in hand, vaulted over the parapet, intent on finishing my quarrel with him where I saw his curly head fifteen yards off in the water of the moat.", "1487": "He swam swiftly and easily. I was weary and half crippled with my wounded arm. I could not gain on him. For a time I made no sound, but as we rounded the corner of the old keep I cried:", "1488": "\u201cStop, Rupert, stop!\u201d", "1489": "I saw him look over his shoulder, but he swam on. He was under the bank now, searching, as I guessed, for a spot that he could climb. I knew there to be none\u2014but there was my rope, which would still be hanging where I had left it. He would come to where it was before I could. Perhaps he would miss it\u2014perhaps he would find it; and if he drew it up after him, he would get a good start of me. I put forth all my remaining strength and pressed on. At last I began to gain on him; for he, occupied with his search, unconsciously slackened his pace.", "1490": "Ah, he had found it! A low shout of triumph came from him. He laid hold of it and began to haul himself up. I was near enough to hear him mutter: \u201cHow the devil comes this here?\u201d I was at the rope, and he, hanging in mid air, saw me, but I could not reach him.", "1491": "\u201cHullo! who\u2019s here?\u201d he cried in startled tones.", "1492": "For a moment, I believe, he took me for the King\u2014I dare say I was pale enough to lend colour to the thought; but an instant later he cried:", "1493": "\u201cWhy it\u2019s the play-actor! How come you here, man?\u201d", "1494": "And so saying he gained the bank.", "1495": "I laid hold of the rope, but I paused. He stood on the bank, sword in hand, and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as I came up. I let go the rope.", "1496": "\u201cNever mind,\u201d said I; \u201cbut as I am here, I think I\u2019ll stay.\u201d", "1497": "He smiled down on me.", "1498": "\u201cThese women are the deuce\u2014\u201d he began; when suddenly the great bell of the Castle started to ring furiously, and a loud shout reached us from the moat.", "1499": "Rupert smiled again, and waved his hand to me.", "1500": "\u201cI should like a turn with you, but it\u2019s a little too hot!\u201d said he, and he disappeared from above me.", "1501": "In an instant, without thinking of danger, I laid my hand to the rope. I was up. I saw him thirty yards off, running like a deer towards the shelter of the forest. For once Rupert Hentzau had chosen discretion for his part. I laid my feet to the ground and rushed after him, calling to him to stand. He would not. Unwounded and vigorous, he gained on me at every step; but, forgetting everything in the world except him and my thirst for his blood, I pressed on, and soon the deep shades of the forest of Zenda engulfed us both, pursued and pursuer.", "1502": "It was three o\u2019clock now, and day was dawning. I was on a long straight grass avenue, and a hundred yards ahead ran young Rupert, his curls waving in the fresh breeze. I was weary and panting; he looked over his shoulder and waved his hand again to me. He was mocking me, for he saw he had the pace of me. I was forced to pause for breath. A moment later, Rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight.", "1503": "I thought all was over, and in deep vexation sank on the ground. But I was up again directly, for a scream rang through the forest\u2014a woman\u2019s scream. Putting forth the last of my strength, I ran on to the place where he had turned out of my sight, and, turning also, I saw him again. But alas! I could not touch him. He was in the act of lifting a girl down from her horse; doubtless it was her scream that I heard. She looked like a small farmer\u2019s or a peasant\u2019s daughter, and she carried a basket on her arm. Probably she was on her way to the early market at Zenda. Her horse was a stout, well shaped animal. Master Rupert lifted her down amid her shrieks\u2014the sight of him frightened her; but he treated her gently, laughed, kissed her, and gave her money. Then he jumped on the horse, sitting sideways like a woman; and then he waited for me. I, on my part, waited for him.", "1504": "Presently he rode towards me, keeping his distance, however. He lifted up his hand, saying:", "1505": "\u201cWhat did you in the Castle?\u201d", "1506": "\u201cI killed three of your friends,\u201d said I.", "1507": "\u201cWhat! You got to the cells?\u201d", "1508": "\u201cYes.\u201d", "1509": "\u201cAnd the King?\u201d", "1510": "\u201cHe was hurt by Detchard before I killed Detchard, but I pray that he lives.\u201d", "1511": "\u201cYou fool!\u201d said Rupert, pleasantly.", "1512": "\u201cOne thing more I did.\u201d", "1513": "\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d", "1514": "\u201cI spared your life. I was behind you on the bridge, with a revolver in my hand.\u201d", "1515": "\u201cNo? Faith, I was between two fires!\u201d", "1516": "\u201cGet off your horse,\u201d I cried, \u201cand fight like a man.\u201d", "1517": "\u201cBefore a lady!\u201d said he, pointing to the girl. \u201cFie, your Majesty!\u201d", "1518": "Then in my rage, hardly knowing what I did, I rushed at him. For a moment he seemed to waver. Then he reined his horse in and stood waiting for me. On I went in my folly. I seized the bridle and I struck at him. He parried and thrust at me. I fell back a pace and rushed at him again; and this time I reached his face and laid his cheek open, and darted back almost before he could strike me. He seemed almost dazed at the fierceness of my attack; otherwise I think he must have killed me. I sank on my knee panting, expecting him to ride at me. And so he would have done, and then and there, I doubt not, one or both of us would have died; but at the moment there came a shout from behind us, and, looking round, I saw, just at the turn of the avenue, a man on a horse. He was riding hard, and he carried a revolver in his hand. It was Fritz von Tarlenheim, my faithful friend. Rupert saw him, and knew that the game was up. He checked his rush at me and flung his leg over the saddle, but yet for just a moment he waited. Leaning forward, he tossed his hair off his forehead and smiled, and said: \u201cAu revoir, Rudolf Rassendyll!\u201d", "1519": "Then, with his cheek streaming blood, but his lips laughing and his body swaying with ease and grace, he bowed to me; and he bowed to the farm-girl, who had drawn near in trembling fascination, and he waved his hand to Fritz, who was just within range and let fly a shot at him. The ball came nigh doing its work, for it struck the sword he held, and he dropped the sword with an oath, wringing his fingers and clapped his heels hard on his horse\u2019s belly, and rode away at a gallop.", "1520": "And I watched him go down the long avenue, riding as though he rode for his pleasure and singing as he went, for all there was that gash in his cheek.", "1521": "Once again he turned to wave his hand, and then the gloom of thickets swallowed him and he was lost from our sight. Thus he vanished\u2014reckless and wary, graceful and graceless, handsome, debonair, vile, and unconquered. And I flung my sword passionately on the ground and cried to Fritz to ride after him. But Fritz stopped his horse, and leapt down and ran to me, and knelt, putting his arm about me. And indeed it was time, for the wound that Detchard had given me was broken forth afresh, and my blood was staining the ground.", "1522": "\u201cThen give me the horse!\u201d I cried, staggering to my feet and throwing his arms off me. And the strength of my rage carried me so far as where the horse stood, and then I fell prone beside it. And Fritz knelt by me again.", "1523": "\u201cFritz!\u201d I said.", "1524": "\u201cAy, friend\u2014dear friend!\u201d he said, tender as a woman.", "1525": "\u201cIs the King alive?\u201d", "1526": "He took his handkerchief and wiped my lips, and bent and kissed me on the forehead.", "1527": "\u201cThanks to the most gallant gentleman that lives,\u201d said he softly, \u201cthe King is alive!\u201d", "1528": "The little farm-girl stood by us, weeping for fright and wide-eyed for wonder; for she had seen me at Zenda; and was not I, pallid, dripping, foul, and bloody as I was\u2014yet was not I the King?", "1529": "And when I heard that the King was alive, I strove to cry \u201cHurrah!\u201d But I could not speak, and I laid my head back in Fritz\u2019s arms and closed my eyes, and I groaned; and then, lest Fritz should do me wrong in his thoughts, I opened my eyes and tried to say \u201cHurrah!\u201d again. But I could not. And being very tired, and now very cold, I huddled myself close up to Fritz, to get the warmth of him, and shut my eyes again and went to sleep.", "1530": "In order to a full understanding of what had occurred in the Castle of Zenda, it is necessary to supplement my account of what I myself saw and did on that night by relating briefly what I afterwards learnt from Fritz and Madame de Mauban. The story told by the latter explained clearly how it happened that the cry which I had arranged as a stratagem and a sham had come, in dreadful reality, before its time, and had thus, as it seemed at the moment, ruined our hopes, while in the end it had favoured them. The unhappy woman, fired, I believe by a genuine attachment to the Duke of Strelsau, no less than by the dazzling prospects which a dominion over him opened before her eyes, had followed him at his request from Paris to Ruritania. He was a man of strong passions, but of stronger will, and his cool head ruled both. He was content to take all and give nothing. When she arrived, she was not long in finding that she had a rival in the Princess Flavia; rendered desperate, she stood at nothing which might give, or keep for her, her power over the duke. As I say, he took and gave not. Simultaneously, Antoinette found herself entangled in his audacious schemes. Unwilling to abandon him, bound to him by the chains of shame and hope, yet she would not be a decoy, nor, at his bidding, lure me to death. Hence the letters of warning she had written. Whether the lines she sent to Flavia were inspired by good or bad feeling, by jealousy or by pity, I do not know; but here also she served us well. When the duke went to Zenda, she accompanied him; and here for the first time she learnt the full measure of his cruelty, and was touched with compassion for the unfortunate King. From this time she was with us; yet, from what she told me, I know that she still (as women will) loved Michael, and trusted to gain his life, if not his pardon, from the King, as the reward for her assistance. His triumph she did not desire, for she loathed his crime, and loathed yet more fiercely what would be the prize of it\u2014his marriage with his cousin, Princess Flavia.", "1531": "At Zenda new forces came into play\u2014the lust and daring of young Rupert. He was caught by her beauty, perhaps; perhaps it was enough for him that she belonged to another man, and that she hated him. For many days there had been quarrels and ill will between him and the duke, and the scene which I had witnessed in the duke\u2019s room was but one of many. Rupert\u2019s proposals to me, of which she had, of course, been ignorant, in no way surprised her when I related them; she had herself warned Michael against Rupert, even when she was calling on me to deliver her from both of them. On this night, then, Rupert had determined to have his will. When she had gone to her room, he, having furnished himself with a key to it, had made his entrance. Her cries had brought the duke, and there in the dark room, while she screamed, the men had fought; and Rupert, having wounded his master with a mortal blow, had, on the servants rushing in, escaped through the window as I have described. The duke\u2019s blood, spurting out, had stained his opponent\u2019s shirt; but Rupert, not knowing that he had dealt Michael his death, was eager to finish the encounter. How he meant to deal with the other three of the band, I know not. I dare say he did not think, for the killing of Michael was not premeditated. Antoinette, left alone with the duke, had tried to stanch his wound, and thus was she busied till he died; and then, hearing Rupert\u2019s taunts, she had come forth to avenge him. Me she had not seen, nor did she till I darted out of my ambush, and leapt after Rupert into the moat.", "1532": "The same moment found my friends on the scene. They had reached the chateau in due time, and waited ready by the door. But Johann, swept with the rest to the rescue of the duke, did not open it; nay, he took a part against Rupert, putting himself forward more bravely than any in his anxiety to avert suspicion; and he had received a wound, in the embrasure of the window. Till nearly half-past two Sapt waited; then, following my orders, he had sent Fritz to search the banks of the moat. I was not there. Hastening back, Fritz told Sapt; and Sapt was for following orders still, and riding at full speed back to Tarlenheim; while Fritz would not hear of abandoning me, let me have ordered what I would. On this they disputed some few minutes; then Sapt, persuaded by Fritz, detached a party under Bernenstein to gallop back to Tarlenheim and bring up the marshal, while the rest fell to on the great door of the chateau. For several minutes it resisted them; then, just as Antoinette de Mauban fired at Rupert of Hentzau on the bridge, they broke in, eight of them in all: and the first door they came to was the door of Michael\u2019s room; and Michael lay dead across the threshold, with a sword-thrust through his breast. Sapt cried out at his death, as I had heard, and they rushed on the servants; but these, in fear, dropped their weapons, and Antoinette flung herself weeping at Sapt\u2019s feet. And all she cried was that I had been at the end of the bridge and leapt off. \u201cWhat of the prisoner?\u201d asked Sapt; but she shook her head. Then Sapt and Fritz, with the gentlemen behind them, crossed the bridge, slowly, warily, and without noise; and Fritz stumbled over the body of De Gautet in the way of the door. They felt him and found him dead.", "1533": "Then they consulted, listening eagerly for any sound from the cells below; but there came none, and they were greatly afraid that the King\u2019s guards had killed him, and having pushed his body through the great pipe, had escaped the same way themselves. Yet, because I had been seen here, they had still some hope (thus indeed Fritz, in his friendship, told me); and going back to Michael\u2019s body, pushing aside Antoinette, who prayed by it, they found a key to the door which I had locked, and opened the door. The staircase was dark, and they would not use a torch at first, lest they should be more exposed to fire. But soon Fritz cried: \u201cThe door down there is open! See, there is light!\u201d So they went on boldly, and found none to oppose them. And when they came to the outer room and saw the Belgian, Bersonin, lying dead, they thanked God, Sapt saying: \u201cAy, he has been here.\u201d Then rushing into the King\u2019s cell, they found Detchard lying dead across the dead physician, and the King on his back with his chair by him. And Fritz cried: \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d and Sapt drove all out of the room except Fritz, and knelt down by the King; and, having learnt more of wounds and the sign of death than I, he soon knew that the King was not dead, nor, if properly attended, would die. And they covered his face and carried him to Duke Michael\u2019s room, and laid him there; and Antoinette rose from praying by the body of the duke and went to bathe the King\u2019s head and dress his wounds, till a doctor came. And Sapt, seeing I had been there, and having heard Antoinette\u2019s story, sent Fritz to search the moat and then the forest. He dared send no one else. And Fritz found my horse, and feared the worst. Then, as I have told, he found me, guided by the shout with which I had called on Rupert to stop and face me. And I think a man has never been more glad to find his own brother alive than was Fritz to come on me; so that, in love and anxiety for me, he thought nothing of a thing so great as would have been the death of Rupert Hentzau. Yet, had Fritz killed him, I should have grudged it.", "1534": "The enterprise of the King\u2019s rescue being thus prosperously concluded, it lay on Colonel Sapt to secure secrecy as to the King ever having been in need of rescue. Antoinette de Mauban and Johann the keeper (who, indeed, was too much hurt to be wagging his tongue just now) were sworn to reveal nothing; and Fritz went forth to find\u2014not the King, but the unnamed friend of the King, who had lain in Zenda and flashed for a moment before the dazed eyes of Duke Michael\u2019s servants on the drawbridge. The metamorphosis had happened; and the King, wounded almost to death by the attacks of the gaolers who guarded his friend, had at last overcome them, and rested now, wounded but alive, in Black Michael\u2019s own room in the Castle. There he had been carried, his face covered with a cloak, from the cell; and thence orders issued, that if his friend were found, he should be brought directly and privately to the King, and that meanwhile messengers should ride at full speed to Tarlenheim, to tell Marshall Strakencz to assure the princess of the King\u2019s safety and to come himself with all speed to greet the King. The princess was enjoined to remain at Tarlenheim, and there await her cousin\u2019s coming or his further injunctions. Thus the King would come to his own again, having wrought brave deeds, and escaped, almost by a miracle, the treacherous assault of his unnatural brother.", "1535": "This ingenious arrangement of my long-headed old friend prospered in every way, save where it encountered a force that often defeats the most cunning schemes. I mean nothing else than the pleasure of a woman. For, let her cousin and sovereign send what command he chose (or Colonel Sapt chose for him), and let Marshal Strakencz insist as he would, the Princess Flavia was in no way minded to rest at Tarlenheim while her lover lay wounded at Zenda; and when the Marshal, with a small suite, rode forth from Tarlenheim on the way to Zenda, the princess\u2019s carriage followed immediately behind, and in this order they passed through the town, where the report was already rife that the King, going the night before to remonstrate with his brother, in all friendliness, for that he held one of the King\u2019s friends in confinement in the Castle, had been most traitorously set upon; that there had been a desperate conflict; that the duke was slain with several of his gentlemen; and that the King, wounded as he was, had seized and held the Castle of Zenda. All of which talk made, as may be supposed, a mighty excitement: and the wires were set in motion, and the tidings came to Strelsau only just after orders had been sent thither to parade the troops and overawe the dissatisfied quarters of the town with a display of force.", "1536": "Thus the Princess Flavia came to Zenda. And as she drove up the hill, with the Marshal riding by the wheel and still imploring her to return in obedience to the King\u2019s orders, Fritz von Tarlenheim, with the prisoner of Zenda, came to the edge of the forest. I had revived from my swoon, and walked, resting on Fritz\u2019s arm; and looking out from the cover of the trees, I saw the princess. Suddenly understanding from a glance at my companion\u2019s face that we must not meet her, I sank on my knees behind a clump of bushes. But there was one whom we had forgotten, but who followed us, and was not disposed to let slip the chance of earning a smile and maybe a crown or two; and, while we lay hidden, the little farm-girl came by us and ran to the princess, curtseying and crying:", "1537": "\u201cMadame, the King is here\u2014in the bushes! May I guide you to him, madame?\u201d", "1538": "\u201cNonsense, child!\u201d said old Strakencz; \u201cthe King lies wounded in the Castle.\u201d", "1539": "\u201cYes, sir, he\u2019s wounded, I know; but he\u2019s there\u2014with Count Fritz\u2014and not at the Castle,\u201d she persisted.", "1540": "\u201cIs he in two places, or are there two Kings?\u201d asked Flavia, bewildered. \u201cAnd how should he be there?\u201d", "1541": "\u201cHe pursued a gentleman, madame, and they fought till Count Fritz came; and the other gentleman took my father\u2019s horse from me and rode away; but the King is here with Count Fritz. Why, madame, is there another man in Ruritania like the King?\u201d", "1542": "\u201cNo, my child,\u201d said Flavia softly (I was told it afterwards), and she smiled and gave the girl money. \u201cI will go and see this gentleman,\u201d and she rose to alight from the carriage.", "1543": "But at this moment Sapt came riding from the Castle, and, seeing the princess, made the best of a bad job, and cried to her that the King was well tended and in no danger.", "1544": "\u201cIn the Castle?\u201d she asked.", "1545": "\u201cWhere else, madame?\u201d said he, bowing.", "1546": "\u201cBut this girl says he is yonder\u2014with Count Fritz.\u201d", "1547": "Sapt turned his eyes on the child with an incredulous smile.", "1548": "\u201cEvery fine gentleman is a King to such,\u201d said he.", "1549": "\u201cWhy, he\u2019s as like the King as one pea to another, madame!\u201d cried the girl, a little shaken but still obstinate.", "1550": "Sapt started round. The old Marshal\u2019s face asked unspoken questions. Flavia\u2019s glance was no less eloquent. Suspicion spread quick.", "1551": "\u201cI\u2019ll ride myself and see this man,\u201d said Sapt hastily.", "1552": "\u201cNay, I\u2019ll come myself,\u201d said the princess.", "1553": "\u201cThen come alone,\u201d he whispered.", "1554": "And she, obedient to the strange hinting in his face, prayed the Marshal and the rest to wait; and she and Sapt came on foot towards where we lay, Sapt waving to the farm-girl to keep at a distance. And when I saw them coming, I sat in a sad heap on the ground, and buried my face in my hands. I could not look at her. Fritz knelt by me, laying his hand on my shoulder.", "1555": "\u201cSpeak low, whatever you say,\u201d I heard Sapt whisper as they came up; and the next thing I heard was a low cry\u2014half of joy, half of fear\u2014from the princess:", "1556": "\u201cIt is he! Are you hurt?\u201d", "1557": "And she fell on the ground by me, and gently pulled my hands away; but I kept my eyes to the ground.", "1558": "\u201cIt is the King!\u201d she said. \u201cPray, Colonel Sapt, tell me where lay the wit of the joke you played on me?\u201d", "1559": "We answered none of us; we three were silent before her. Regardless of them, she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me. Then Sapt spoke in a low hoarse whisper:", "1560": "\u201cIt is not the King. Don\u2019t kiss him; he\u2019s not the King.\u201d", "1561": "She drew back for a moment; then, with an arm still round my neck, she asked, in superb indignation:", "1562": "\u201cDo I not know my love? Rudolf my love!\u201d", "1563": "\u201cIt is not the King,\u201d said old Sapt again; and a sudden sob broke from tender-hearted Fritz.", "1564": "It was the sob that told her no comedy was afoot.", "1565": "\u201cHe is the King!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is the King\u2019s face\u2014the King\u2019s ring\u2014my ring! It is my love!\u201d", "1566": "\u201cYour love, madame,\u201d said old Sapt, \u201cbut not the King. The King is there in the Castle. This gentleman\u2014\u201d", "1567": "\u201cLook at me, Rudolf! look at me!\u201d she cried, taking my face between her hands. \u201cWhy do you let them torment me? Tell me what it means!\u201d", "1568": "Then I spoke, gazing into her eyes.", "1569": "\u201cGod forgive me, madame!\u201d I said. \u201cI am not the King!\u201d", "1570": "I felt her hands clutch my cheeks. She gazed at me as never man\u2019s face was scanned yet. And I, silent again, saw wonder born, and doubt grow, and terror spring to life as she looked. And very gradually the grasp of her hands slackened; she turned to Sapt, to Fritz, and back to me: then suddenly she reeled forward and fell in my arms; and with a great cry of pain I gathered her to me and kissed her lips. Sapt laid his hand on my arm. I looked up in his face. And I laid her softly on the ground, and stood up, looking on her, cursing heaven that young Rupert\u2019s sword had spared me for this sharper pang.", "1571": "It was night, and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the Castle of Zenda. The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d was gone, and the lights in the room across the moat twinkled in the darkness. All was still; the din and clash of strife were gone. I had spent the day hidden in the forest, from the time when Fritz had led me off, leaving Sapt with the princess. Under cover of dusk, muffled up, I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay. Though three men had died there\u2014two of them by my hand\u2014I was not troubled by ghosts. I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window, and was looking out on the black water; Johann, the keeper, still pale from his wound, but not much hurt besides, had brought me supper. He told me that the King was doing well, that he had seen the princess; that she and he, Sapt and Fritz, had been long together. Marshal Strakencz was gone to Strelsau; Black Michael lay in his coffin, and Antoinette de Mauban watched by him; had I not heard, from the chapel, priests singing mass for him?", "1572": "Outside there were strange rumours afloat. Some said that the prisoner of Zenda was dead; some, that he had vanished yet alive; some, that he was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England; others, that he had discovered the Duke\u2019s plots, and had therefore been kidnapped by him. One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said only that they would say nothing, but they had suspicions that more was to be known than was known, if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew.", "1573": "Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone, thinking, not of the future, but\u2014as a man is wont to do when stirring things have happened to him\u2014rehearsing the events of the past weeks, and wondering how strangely they had fallen out. And above me, in the stillness of the night, I heard the standards flapping against their poles, for Black Michael\u2019s banner hung there half-mast high, and above it the royal flag of Ruritania, floating for one night more over my head. Habit grows so quick, that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer for me.", "1574": "Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room. I was standing then by the window; the glass was opened, and I was idly fingering the cement which clung to the masonry where \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d had been. He told me briefly that the King wanted me, and together we crossed the drawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael\u2019s.", "1575": "The King was lying there in bed; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in attendance on him, and whispered to me that my visit must be brief. The King held out his hand and shook mine. Fritz and the doctor withdrew to the window.", "1576": "I took the King\u2019s ring from my finger and placed it on his.", "1577": "\u201cI have tried not to dishonour it, sire,\u201d said I.", "1578": "\u201cI can\u2019t talk much to you,\u201d he said, in a weak voice. \u201cI have had a great fight with Sapt and the Marshal\u2014for we have told the Marshal everything. I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me, and tell everyone of what you had done; and you would have been my best and nearest friend, Cousin Rudolf. But they tell me I must not, and that the secret must be kept\u2014if kept it can be.\u201d", "1579": "\u201cThey are right, sire. Let me go. My work here is done.\u201d", "1580": "\u201cYes, it is done, as no man but you could have done it. When they see me again, I shall have my beard on; I shall\u2014yes, faith, I shall be wasted with sickness. They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face. Cousin, I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else. You have shown me how to play the King.\u201d", "1581": "\u201cSire,\u201d said I. \u201cI can take no praise from you. It is by the narrowest grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother.\u201d", "1582": "He turned inquiring eyes on me; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles, and he had no strength to question me. His glance fell on Flavia\u2019s ring, which I wore.

Fritz came with the doctor. I kissed the King\u2019s hand, and let Fritz lead me away. I have never seen the King since.", "1586": "Outside, Fritz turned, not to the right, back towards the drawbridge, but to the left, and without speaking led me upstairs, through a handsome corridor in the chateau.", "1587": "\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.", "1588": "Looking away from me, Fritz answered:", "1589": "\u201cShe has sent for you. When it is over, come back to the bridge. I\u2019ll wait for you there.\u201d", "1590": "\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d said I, breathing quickly.", "1591": "He shook his head.", "1592": "\u201cDoes she know everything?\u201d", "1593": "\u201cYes, everything.\u201d", "1594": "He opened a door, and gently pushing me in, closed it behind me. I found myself in a drawing-room, small and richly furnished. At first I thought that I was alone, for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles on the mantelpiece was very dim. But presently I discerned a woman\u2019s figure standing by the window. I knew it was the princess, and I walked up to her, fell on one knee, and carried the hand that hung by her side to my lips. She neither moved nor spoke. I rose to my feet, and, piercing the gloom with my eager eyes, saw her pale face and the gleam of her hair, and before I knew, I spoke softly:", "1595": "\u201cFlavia!\u201d", "1596": "She trembled a little, and looked round. Then she darted to me, taking hold of me.", "1597": "\u201cDon\u2019t stand, don\u2019t stand! No, you mustn\u2019t! You\u2019re hurt! Sit down\u2014here, here!\u201d", "1598": "She made me sit on a sofa, and put her hand on my forehead.", "1599": "\u201cHow hot your head is,\u201d she said, sinking on her knees by me. Then she laid her head against me, and I heard her murmur: \u201cMy darling, how hot your head is!\u201d", "1600": "Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover\u2019s heart. I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption; but what I said now was:", "1601": "\u201cI love you with all my heart and soul!\u201d", "1602": "For what troubled and shamed her? Not her love for me, but the fear that I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King, and taken her kisses with a smothered smile.", "1603": "\u201cWith all my life and heart,\u201d said I, as she clung to me. \u201cAlways, from the first moment I saw you in the Cathedral! There has been but one woman in the world to me\u2014and there will be no other. But God forgive me the wrong I\u2019ve done you!\u201d", "1604": "\u201cThey made you do it!\u201d she said quickly; and she added, raising her head and looking in my eyes: \u201cIt might have made no difference if I\u2019d known it. It was always you, never the King!\u201d", "1605": "\u201cI meant to tell you,\u201d said I. \u201cI was going to on the night of the ball in Strelsau, when Sapt interrupted me. After that, I couldn\u2019t\u2014I couldn\u2019t risk losing you before\u2014before\u2014I must! My darling, for you I nearly left the King to die!\u201d", "1606": "\u201cI know, I know! What are we to do now, Rudolf?\u201d", "1607": "I put my arm round her and held her up while I said:", "1608": "\u201cI am going away tonight.\u201d", "1609": "\u201cAh, no, no!\u201d she cried. \u201cNot tonight!\u201d", "1610": "\u201cI must go tonight, before more people have seen me. And how would you have me stay, sweetheart, except\u2014?\u201d", "1611": "\u201cIf I could come with you!\u201d she whispered very low.", "1612": "\u201cMy God!\u201d said I roughly, \u201cdon\u2019t talk about that!\u201d and I thrust her a little back from me.", "1613": "\u201cWhy not? I love you. You are as good a gentleman as the King!\u201d", "1614": "Then I was false to all that I should have held by. For I caught her in my arms and prayed her, in words that I will not write, to come with me, daring all Ruritania to take her from me. And for a while she listened, with wondering, dazzled eyes. But as her eyes looked on me, I grew ashamed, and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings, and at last I was silent.", "1615": "She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall, while I sat on the edge of the sofa, trembling in every limb, knowing what I had done\u2014loathing it, obstinate not to undo it. So we rested a long time.", "1616": "\u201cI am mad!\u201d I said sullenly.", "1617": "\u201cI love your madness, dear,\u201d she answered.", "1618": "Her face was away from me, but I caught the sparkle of a tear on her cheek. I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there.", "1619": "\u201cIs love the only thing?\u201d she asked, in low, sweet tones that seemed to bring a calm even to my wrung heart. \u201cIf love were the only thing, I would follow you\u2014in rags, if need be\u2014to the world\u2019s end; for you hold my heart in the hollow of your hand! But is love the only thing?\u201d", "1620": "I made no answer. It gives me shame now to think that I would not help her.", "1621": "She came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder. I put my hand up and held hers.", "1622": "\u201cI know people write and talk as if it were. Perhaps, for some, Fate lets it be. Ah, if I were one of them! But if love had been the only thing, you would have let the King die in his cell.\u201d", "1623": "I kissed her hand.", "1624": "\u201cHonour binds a woman too, Rudolf. My honour lies in being true to my country and my House. I don\u2019t know why God has let me love you; but I know that I must stay.\u201d", "1625": "Still I said nothing; and she, pausing a while, then went on:", "1626": "\u201cYour ring will always be on my finger, your heart in my heart, the touch of your lips on mine. But you must go and I must stay. Perhaps I must do what it kills me to think of doing.\u201d", "1627": "I knew what she meant, and a shiver ran through me. But I could not utterly fail her. I rose and took her hand.", "1628": "\u201cDo what you will, or what you must,\u201d I said. \u201cI think God shows His purposes to such as you. My part is lighter; for your ring shall be on my finger and your heart in mine, and no touch save of your lips will ever be on mine. So, may God comfort you, my darling!\u201d", "1629": "There struck on our ears the sound of singing. The priests in the chapel were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead. They seemed to chant a requiem over our buried joy, to pray forgiveness for our love that would not die. The soft, sweet, pitiful music rose and fell as we stood opposite one another, her hands in mine.", "1630": "\u201cMy queen and my beauty!\u201d said I.", "1631": "\u201cMy lover and true knight!\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps we shall never see one another again. Kiss me, my dear, and go!\u201d", "1632": "I kissed her as she bade me; but at the last she clung to me, whispering nothing but my name, and that over and over again\u2014and again\u2014and again; and then I left her.", "1633": "Rapidly I walked down to the bridge. Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me. Under their directions I changed my dress, and muffling my face, as I had done more than once before, I mounted with them at the door of the Castle, and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day, and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border of Ruritania. The train was not quite due, and I walked with them in a meadow by a little brook while we waited for it. They promised to send me all news; they overwhelmed me with kindness\u2014even old Sapt was touched to gentleness, while Fritz was half unmanned. I listened in a kind of dream to all they said. \u201cRudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!\u201d still rang in my ears\u2014a burden of sorrow and of love. At last they saw that I could not heed them, and we walked up and down in silence, till Fritz touched me on the arm, and I saw, a mile or more away, the blue smoke of the train. Then I held out a hand to each of them.", "1634": "\u201cWe are all but half-men this morning,\u201d said I, smiling. \u201cBut we have been men, eh, Sapt and Fritz, old friends? We have run a good course between us.\u201d", "1635": "\u201cWe have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne,\u201d said Sapt.", "1636": "Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly, before I could discern his purpose or stay him, uncovered his head and bent as he used to do, and kissed my hand; and as I snatched it away, he said, trying to laugh:", "1637": "\u201cHeaven doesn\u2019t always make the right men kings!\u201d", "1638": "Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand.", "1639": "\u201cThe devil has his share in most things,\u201d said he.", "1640": "The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with the muffled face, but we took no notice of their glances. I stood with my two friends and waited till the train came up to us. Then we shook hands again, saying nothing; and both this time\u2014and, indeed, from old Sapt it seemed strange\u2014bared their heads, and so stood still till the train bore me away from their sight. So that it was thought some great man travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that morning; whereas, in truth it was only I, Rudolf Rassendyll, an English gentleman, a cadet of a good house, but a man of no wealth nor position, nor of much rank. They would have been disappointed to know that. Yet had they known all they would have looked more curiously still. For, be I what I might now, I had been for three months a King, which, if not a thing to be proud of, is at least an experience to have undergone. Doubtless I should have thought more of it, had there not echoed through the air, from the towers of Zenda that we were leaving far away, into my ears and into my heart the cry of a woman\u2019s love\u2014\u201cRudolf! Rudolf! Rudolf!\u201d", "1641": "Hark! I hear it now!", "1642": "The details of my return home can have but little interest. I went straight to the Tyrol and spent a quiet fortnight\u2014mostly on my back, for a severe chill developed itself; and I was also the victim of a nervous reaction, which made me weak as a baby. As soon as I had reached my quarters, I sent an apparently careless postcard to my brother, announcing my good health and prospective return. That would serve to satisfy the inquiries as to my whereabouts, which were probably still vexing the Prefect of the Police of Strelsau. I let my moustache and imperial grow again; and as hair comes quickly on my face, they were respectable, though not luxuriant, by the time that I landed myself in Paris and called on my friend George Featherly. My interview with him was chiefly remarkable for the number of unwilling but necessary falsehoods that I told; and I rallied him unmercifully when he told me that he had made up his mind that I had gone in the track of Madame de Mauban to Strelsau. The lady, it appeared, was back in Paris, but was living in great seclusion\u2014a fact for which gossip found no difficulty in accounting. Did not all the world know of the treachery and death of Duke Michael? Nevertheless, George bade Bertram Bertrand be of good cheer, \u201cfor,\u201d said he flippantly, \u201ca live poet is better than a dead duke.\u201d Then he turned on me and asked:", "1643": "\u201cWhat have you been doing to your moustache?\u201d", "1644": "\u201cTo tell the truth,\u201d I answered, assuming a sly air, \u201ca man now and then has reasons for wishing to alter his appearance. But it\u2019s coming on very well again.\u201d", "1645": "\u201cWhat? Then I wasn\u2019t so far out! If not the fair Antoinette, there was a charmer?\u201d", "1646": "\u201cThere is always a charmer,\u201d said I, sententiously.", "1647": "But George would not be satisfied till he had wormed out of me (he took much pride in his ingenuity) an absolutely imaginary love-affair, attended with the proper soup\u00e7on of scandal, which had kept me all this time in the peaceful regions of the Tyrol. In return for this narrative, George regaled me with a great deal of what he called \u201cinside information\u201d (known only to diplomatists), as to the true course of events in Ruritania, the plots and counterplots. In his opinion, he told me, with a significant nod, there was more to be said for Black Michael than the public supposed; and he hinted at a well-founded suspicion that the mysterious prisoner of Zenda, concerning whom a good many paragraphs had appeared, was not a man at all, but (here I had much ado not to smile) a woman disguised as a man; and that strife between the King and his brother for this imaginary lady\u2019s favour was at the bottom of their quarrel.", "1648": "\u201cPerhaps it was Madame de Mauban herself,\u201d I suggested.", "1649": "\u201cNo!\u201d said George decisively, \u201cAntoinette de Mauban was jealous of her, and betrayed the duke to the King for that reason. And, to confirm what I say, it\u2019s well known that the Princess Flavia is now extremely cold to the King, after having been most affectionate.\u201d", "1650": "At this point I changed the subject, and escaped from George\u2019s \u201cinspired\u201d delusions. But if diplomatists never know anything more than they had succeeded in finding out in this instance, they appear to me to be somewhat expensive luxuries.", "1651": "While in Paris I wrote to Antoinette, though I did not venture to call upon her. I received in return a very affecting letter, in which she assured me that the King\u2019s generosity and kindness, no less than her regard for me, bound her conscience to absolute secrecy. She expressed the intention of settling in the country, and withdrawing herself entirely from society. Whether she carried out her designs, I have never heard; but as I have not met her, or heard news of her up to this time, it is probable that she did. There is no doubt that she was deeply attached to the Duke of Strelsau; and her conduct at the time of his death proved that no knowledge of the man\u2019s real character was enough to root her regard for him out of her heart.", "1652": "I had one more battle left to fight\u2014a battle that would, I knew, be severe, and was bound to end in my complete defeat. Was I not back from the Tyrol, without having made any study of its inhabitants, institutions, scenery, fauna, flora, or other features? Had I not simply wasted my time in my usual frivolous, good-for-nothing way? That was the aspect of the matter which, I was obliged to admit, would present itself to my sister-in-law; and against a verdict based on such evidence, I had really no defence to offer. It may be supposed, then, that I presented myself in Park Lane in a shamefaced, sheepish fashion. On the whole, my reception was not so alarming as I had feared. It turned out that I had done, not what Rose wished, but\u2014the next best thing\u2014what she prophesied. She had declared that I should make no notes, record no observations, gather no materials. My brother, on the other hand, had been weak enough to maintain that a serious resolve had at length animated me.", "1653": "When I returned empty-handed, Rose was so occupied in triumphing over Burlesdon that she let me down quite easily, devoting the greater part of her reproaches to my failure to advertise my friends of my whereabouts.", "1654": "\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted a lot of time trying to find you,\u201d she said.", "1655": "\u201cI know you have,\u201d said I. \u201cHalf our ambassadors have led weary lives on my account. George Featherly told me so. But why should you have been anxious? I can take care of myself.\u201d", "1656": "\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t that,\u201d she cried scornfully, \u201cbut I wanted to tell you about Sir Jacob Borrodaile. You know, he\u2019s got an Embassy\u2014at least, he will have in a month\u2014and he wrote to say he hoped you would go with him.\u201d", "1657": "\u201cWhere\u2019s he going to?\u201d", "1658": "\u201cHe\u2019s going to succeed Lord Topham at Strelsau,\u201d said she. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a nicer place, short of Paris.\u201d", "1659": "\u201cStrelsau! H\u2019m!\u201d said I, glancing at my brother.", "1660": "\u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d exclaimed Rose impatiently. \u201cNow, you will go, won\u2019t you?\u201d", "1661": "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I care about it!\u201d", "1662": "\u201cOh, you\u2019re too exasperating!\u201d", "1663": "\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I can go to Strelsau. My dear Rose, would it be\u2014suitable?\u201d", "1664": "\u201cOh, nobody remembers that horrid old story now.\u201d", "1665": "Upon this, I took out of my pocket a portrait of the King of Ruritania. It had been taken a month or two before he ascended the throne. She could not miss my point when I said, putting it into her hands:", "1666": "\u201cIn case you\u2019ve not seen, or not noticed, a picture of Rudolf V, there he is. Don\u2019t you think they might recall the story, if I appeared at the Court of Ruritania?\u201d", "1667": "My sister-in-law looked at the portrait, and then at me.", "1668": "\u201cGood gracious!\u201d she said, and flung the photograph down on the table.", "1669": "\u201cWhat do you say, Bob?\u201d I asked.", "1670": "Burlesdon got up, went to a corner of the room, and searched in a heap of newspapers. Presently he came back with a copy of the Illustrated London News. Opening the paper, he displayed a double-page engraving of the Coronation of Rudolf V at Strelsau. The photograph and the picture he laid side by side. I sat at the table fronting them; and, as I looked, I grew absorbed. My eye travelled from my own portrait to Sapt, to Strakencz, to the rich robes of the Cardinal, to Black Michael\u2019s face, to the stately figure of the princess by his side. Long I looked and eagerly. I was roused by my brother\u2019s hand on my shoulder. He was gazing down at me with a puzzled expression.", "1671": "\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable likeness, you see,\u201d said I. \u201cI really think I had better not go to Ruritania.\u201d", "1672": "Rose, though half convinced, would not abandon her position.", "1673": "\u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse,\u201d she said pettishly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything. Why, you might become an ambassador!\u201d", "1674": "\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to be an ambassador,\u201d said I.", "1675": "\u201cIt\u2019s more than you ever will be,\u201d she retorted.", "1676": "That is very likely true, but it is not more than I have been.", "1677": "The idea of being an ambassador could scarcely dazzle me. I had been a king!", "1678": "So pretty Rose left us in dudgeon; and Burlesdon, lighting a cigarette, looked at me still with that curious gaze.", "1679": "\u201cThat picture in the paper\u2014\u201d he said.", "1680": "\u201cWell, what of it? It shows that the King of Ruritania and your humble servant are as like as two peas.\u201d", "1681": "My brother shook his head.", "1682": "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should know you from the man in the photograph.\u201d", "1683": "\u201cAnd not from the picture in the paper?\u201d", "1684": "\u201cI should know the photograph from the picture: the picture\u2019s very like the photograph, but\u2014\u201d", "1685": "\u201cWell?\u201d", "1686": "\u201cIt\u2019s more like you!\u201d said my brother.", "1687": "My brother is a good man and true\u2014so that, for all that he is a married man and mighty fond of his wife, he should know any secret of mine. But this secret was not mine, and I could not tell it to him.", "1688": "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much like me as the photograph,\u201d said I boldly. \u201cBut, anyhow, Bob, I won\u2019t go to Strelsau.\u201d", "1689": "\u201cNo, don\u2019t go to Strelsau, Rudolf,\u201d said he.", "1690": "And whether he suspects anything, or has a glimmer of the truth, I do not know. If he has, he keeps it to himself, and he and I never refer to it. And we let Sir Jacob Borrodaile find another attache.", "1691": "Since all these events whose history I have set down happened I have lived a very quiet life at a small house which I have taken in the country. The ordinary ambitions and aims of men in my position seem to me dull and unattractive. I have little fancy for the whirl of society, and none for the jostle of politics. Lady Burlesdon utterly despairs of me; my neighbours think me an indolent, dreamy, unsociable fellow. Yet I am a young man; and sometimes I have a fancy\u2014the superstitious would call it a presentiment\u2014that my part in life is not yet altogether played; that, somehow and some day, I shall mix again in great affairs, I shall again spin policies in a busy brain, match my wits against my enemies\u2019, brace my muscles to fight a good fight and strike stout blows. Such is the tissue of my thoughts as, with gun or rod in hand, I wander through the woods or by the side of the stream. Whether the fancy will be fulfilled, I cannot tell\u2014still less whether the scene that, led by memory, I lay for my new exploits will be the true one\u2014for I love to see myself once again in the crowded streets of Strelsau, or beneath the frowning keep of the Castle of Zenda.", "1692": "Thus led, my broodings leave the future, and turn back on the past. Shapes rise before me in long array\u2014the wild first revel with the King, the rush with my brave tea-table, the night in the moat, the pursuit in the forest: my friends and my foes, the people who learnt to love and honour me, the desperate men who tried to kill me. And, from amidst these last, comes one who alone of all of them yet moves on earth, though where I know not, yet plans (as I do not doubt) wickedness, yet turns women\u2019s hearts to softness and men\u2019s to fear and hate. Where is young Rupert of Hentzau\u2014the boy who came so nigh to beating me? When his name comes into my head, I feel my hand grip and the blood move quicker through my veins: and the hint of Fate\u2014the presentiment\u2014seems to grow stronger and more definite, and to whisper insistently in my ear that I have yet a hand to play with young Rupert; therefore I exercise myself in arms, and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth must leave me.", "1693": "One break comes every year in my quiet life. Then I go to Dresden, and there I am met by my dear friend and companion, Fritz von Tarlenheim. Last time, his pretty wife Helga came, and a lusty crowing baby with her. And for a week Fritz and I are together, and I hear all of what falls out in Strelsau; and in the evenings, as we walk and smoke together, we talk of Sapt, and of the King, and often of young Rupert; and, as the hours grow small, at last we speak of Flavia. For every year Fritz carries with him to Dresden a little box; in it lies a red rose, and round the stalk of the rose is a slip of paper with the words written: \u201cRudolf\u2014Flavia\u2014always.\u201d And the like I send back by him. That message, and the wearing of the rings, are all that now bind me and the Queen of Ruritania. For\u2014nobler, as I hold her, for the act\u2014she has followed where her duty to her country and her House led her, and is the wife of the King, uniting his subjects to him by the love they bear to her, giving peace and quiet days to thousands by her self-sacrifice. There are moments when I dare not think of it, but there are others when I rise in spirit to where she ever dwells; then I can thank God that I love the noblest lady in the world, the most gracious and beautiful, and that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high duty.", "1694": "Shall I see her face again\u2014the pale face and the glorious hair? Of that I know nothing; Fate has no hint, my heart no presentiment. I do not know. In this world, perhaps\u2014nay, it is likely\u2014never. And can it be that somewhere, in a manner whereof our flesh-bound minds have no apprehension, she and I will be together again, with nothing to come between us, nothing to forbid our love? That I know not, nor wiser heads than mine. But if it be never\u2014if I can never hold sweet converse again with her, or look upon her face, or know from her her love; why, then, this side the grave, I will live as becomes the man whom she loves; and, for the other side, I must pray a dreamless sleep."}}}]
